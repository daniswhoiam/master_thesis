Transport phenomena,1,G-XEC-2015-63-20,NUM,41,The diffusion coefficient of copper atoms in aluminium is found to be 1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ at T=400K and 5.75 x $10^(-19)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ at T=500K. Find the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$," [ ]
To find the temperature, we need to use the Arrhenius equation for diffusion coefficient:
$$D = D_0 \exp\left(\frac{-Q}{kT}\right)$$
where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient at a given temperature, $D_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, $Q$ is the activation energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.
We are given two values of $D$ at different temperatures. We can rearrange the equation to find $Q$:
$$\ln\left(\frac{D}{D_0}\right) = -\frac{Q}{kT}$$
Let's call the temperature we want to find as $T_x$. We have two equations:
1) $\ln\left(\frac{1.28 \times 10^{-22}}{D_0}\right) = -\frac{Q}{k(400+273)}$
2) $\ln\left(\frac{5.75 \times 10^{-19}}{D_0}\right) = -\frac{Q}{k(500+273)}$
We can solve these equations simultaneously to find $Q$ and then use it to find $T_x$. However, it's easier to take the natural logarithm of both sides and simplify:
1) $\ln\left(\frac{1.28 \times 10^{-22}}{D_0}\right) = -\frac{Q}{413.15}$
2) $\ln\left(\frac{5.75 \times 10^{-19}}{D_0}\right) = -\frac{Q}{453.15}$
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
$$\ln\left(\frac{4.42 \times 10^{-8}}{1}\right) = -\frac{Q}{1000.3} \implies Q = -4.42 \times 10^{-8} \times 1000.3$$
Now, we can use the Arrhenius equation to find $T_x$:
$$\ln\left(\frac{10^{-16}}{D_0}\right) = -\frac{-4.42 \times 10^{-8} \times 1000.3}{kT_x}$$
Solving for $T_x$, we get:
$$T_x = \frac{(-4.42 \times 10^{-8} \times 1000.3)}{k\ln(10^{16}/D_0)}$$
Substituting the value of Boltzmann constant $k$, we get:
$$T_x = \frac{(-4.42 \times 10^{-8} \times 1000.3)}{(1.3807 \times 10^{-23}) \ln(10^{16}/D_0)}$$

Transport phenomena,2,G-XEC-2019-5,MCQS-NUM,70,"(Given: Diffusion coefficients of copper in aluminium at 400 °C and 500 °C are 5*$10^(-14)m^(2)s^(-1)$ and 6*$10^(-13)m^(2)s^(-1)$, respectively). Copper is diffused into aluminium at 400 °C for 100 hours to obtain a certain concentration at a given depth. In another experiment conducted at 500 °C, to achieve the same concentration of copper at the same depth, the time required in hours is  (A) 7.33 (B) 8.33 (C) 9.33 (D) 10.33"," [C] The diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the time required for a given concentration change at constant temperature. Therefore, the time required at higher temperature is less than that at lower temperature. So, we need to find the ratio of the diffusion coefficients and then find the reciprocal of that ratio to get the time ratio.

Given: Diffusion coefficient of copper in aluminium at 400 °C = $5*10^{-14}m^2s^{-1}$
Diffusion coefficient of copper in aluminium at 500 °C = $6*10^{-13}m^2s^{-1}$

Time ratio = $\frac{time\ at\ 400°C}{time\ at\ 500°C}$ = $\frac{1}{diffusion\ coefficient\ ratio}$

Diffusion coefficient ratio = $\frac{diffusion\ coefficient\ at\ 500°C}{diffusion\ coefficient\ at\ 400°C}$ = $\frac{6*10^{-13}}{5*10^{-14}}$ = $1.2*10^(-1)$

Time ratio = $\frac{1}{1.2*10^{-1}}$ = $8.33$ hours

Transport phenomena,3,G-XEC-2014-22,NUM,32,The diffusion coefficients of Mg in Al at 500 and 550 °C are 1.9 * $10^(-13)$ and 5.8*10^(-13) $m^2/s$ respectively. The activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al in kJ/mol is," [Q] The given data can be used to determine the Arrhenius equation parameters, A and Ea, for the diffusion of Mg in Al. However, we cannot directly calculate the activation energy (Ea) from the given information alone. We need to know either the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient or the pre-exponential factor (A).

Here's how you can derive the Arrhenius equation parameters if you have both the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient and its value at a reference temperature:

1. Rearrange the Arrhenius equation to solve for Ea: ln(D) = ln(A) + (-Ea/R)(1/T), where D is the diffusion coefficient, T is the absolute temperature, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), and A is the pre-exponential factor.
2. Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(D) = ln(A) - Ea/R * 1/T.
3. Plot ln(D) against 1/T to obtain a straight line, with the slope equal to -Ea/R and the intercept equal to ln(A).
4. Solve for Ea by finding the negative reciprocal of the slope (-1/slope = Ea/R).

Since we don't have enough information in this question to determine both A and Ea, we cannot directly calculate the activation energy (Ea) from the given data.

To find the time, we can use the following equation for one-dimensional diffusion:
$C(x,t)=C_0\left[1−\frac{4}{\pi ^2}\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\frac{1}{n^2}exp\left(\frac{-Dt}{{\left(nx\right)}^2}\right)\right]$
where $C(x,t)$ is the concentration at a depth x and time t, $C_0$ is the initial surface concentration, D is the diffusion coefficient, and n is an integer.
We want to find the time it takes for the concentration at a depth of $10^(−3)$ cm to be one half the surface concentration:
$C\left(10^(−3),t\right)=\frac{1}{2}C_0$
Substituting the given values, we have:
$\frac{1}{2}C_0=C_0\left[1−\frac{4}{\pi ^2}\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\frac{1}{n^2}exp\left(\frac{-Dt}{{\left(nx\right)}^2}\right)\right]$

Using a graphing calculator or software, we can plot the left-hand side of the equation against time and find the time at which it intersects with 1 (the right-hand side). This will give us an approximate value for the time.

To find the value of x, we need to use the following equation:
D = D° * exp(Q/R*T)
Where T is the temperature in Kelvin.
First, let's convert the given temperature (727 °C) to Kelvin:
T = 727 °C + 273.15 = 1000.15 K
Now we can calculate the value of D using the given equation:
D = 2* $10^(-5)m^2/s$ * exp(142 kJ/mol * (8.314 J/mol.K)/(8.314 J/mol.K * 1000.15 K))
D = $1.67*10^{-9}m^2/s$

x = D / ($10^(-13}m^2/s$)
x = ($1.67*10^{-9}m^2/s$)/($10^(-13}m^2/s$)

Nickel corrodes at 298 K in a solution of 0.06 M nickel chloride having pH 4. Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer)"," ___________
Explanation:
The given reaction for the corrosion of nickel in a solution of nickel chloride can be written as:
Ni → Ni2+ + 2e-
And the reduction reaction is:
2H+ + 2e- → H2
The standard reduction potential for nickel (Ni2+/Ni) is given as -0.25 V. The standard reduction potential for hydrogen (H+/H2) is 0.00 V. We can use the Nernst equation to calculate the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel:
E = E° + (RT / nF) ln(Q)
Where,
E = cell potential at given temperature and concentration
E° = standard cell potential
R = universal gas constant
T = absolute temperature in Kelvin
n = number of electrons transferred in the reaction
F = Faraday's constant
ln = natural logarithm
Q = reaction quotient
We can calculate the reaction quotient as:
Q = [Ni2+]^2 [H2]^2 / [Ni]
Given, [Ni] = 0.06 M, [Ni2+] = 0.06 M and pH = 4, we can calculate the concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) using the formula:
pH = -log10[H+]
pH = 4 => [H+] = 10^(-4) M
Now, we can calculate the concentration of hydrogen gas (H2) at equilibrium using the equation:
Kc = [Ni2+]^2 [H2] / [Ni]^2 [P(H2)]
Where, Kc is the solubility product constant for nickel chloride.
The value of Kc for nickel chloride at 298 K is 1.2 × 10^-16 M.
Substituting the values in the equation:
1.2 × 10^-16 = (0.06)^2 [H2] / (1)^2 [P(H2)]
[H2] = [P(H2)] × 1.2 × 10^-16 / 0.06^2
[H2] = 3.98 × 10^-5 atm
Now, we can calculate the cell potential (E) using the Nernst equation:
E = E° + (RT / nF) ln(Q)
E = -0.25 V + (8.314 J K^(-1)mol^(-1) × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C mol^(-1)) × ln([Ni2+]^2 [H2] / [Ni]^2)
E = -0.25 V + (8.314 J K^(-1)mol^(-1) × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C mol^(-1)) × ln((0.06)^2 × 3.98 × 10^-5 / 1^2)
E = -0.25 V + (8.314 J K^(-1)mol^(-1) × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C mol^(-1)) × ln(0.000127)
E = -0.25 V + (-0.013 V)
E = -0.263 V
Now, we can calculate the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel by setting E = 0 in the Nernst equation:
0 = E° + (RT / nF) ln(Q)
ln(Q) = -(E° × nF / RT)
ln(Q) = -((-0.25 V × 2 × 96500 C mol^(-1) / (8.314 J K^(-1)mol^(-1) × 298 K))
ln(Q) = 0.172
Q = e^0.172
Q = 1.18
Therefore, the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is:
pH2 = P° × Q
Where, P° is the standard atmospheric pressure = 1 atm
pH2 = 1 atm × 1.18
pH2 = 1.18 atm
Answer: [1] or [1.2] (rounded off to the nearest integer)
Note: The exact value of the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel depends on the accuracy of the given data and assumptions made in the calculation. The above answer is an approximation.",,,0,
Transport phenomena,7,G-XEC-2020-22,NUM,74,Given: Diffusivity of carbon in iron at 1100 °C is 6.0* $10^(-11)m^(2).s^(-1) and erf(z) from the image. A plain carbon steel sample containing 0.1 wt% carbon is undergoing carburization at 1100 ° C in a carbon rich surroundings with fixed carbon content of 1.0 wt% all the time. The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer). ," [ ]
To find the carbon concentration as a function of depth, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion:
$J = -D \frac{dC}{dz}$
where $J$ is the flux of carbon, $D$ is the diffusivity, and $C$ is the concentration.
We can rearrange this equation to find the concentration as a function of depth:
$\frac{dC}{dz} = -\frac{J}{D}$
Integrating both sides with respect to $z$, we get:
$C(z) = C_0 + \frac{J}{D}z$
where $C_0$ is the initial concentration at the surface.
We can find $J$ by using the boundary conditions: at the surface, carbon is diffusing in from the surroundings, so the flux is positive and equal to $-F$, where $F$ is the mass flow rate of carbon per unit area:
$-F = J = -D \frac{dC}{dz}$
At the depth $z=h$, the concentration is $C_s$:
$C(h) = C_0 + \frac{-F}{D}h = C_s$
We can find $C_0$ by using the given initial concentration:
$C_0 = C_{initial} - \frac{F}{D}h$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = C_{initial} - \frac{F}{D}h + \frac{J}{D}z$
We can find $J$ by using the given mass of carbon in the sample and the volume of the sample:
$M_{carbon} = \rho V = (\rho_{Fe}(1-\omega) + \rho_C\omega)V$
where $\rho_{Fe}$ is the density of iron, $\omega$ is the volume fraction of carbon, and $V$ is the volume of the sample.
We can find $\omega$ by using the given weight percent of carbon:
$\omega = \frac{m_{carbon}}{M_{sample}}$
where $m_{carbon}$ is the mass of carbon in the sample and $M_{sample}$ is the total mass of the sample.
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{m_{carbon}}{M_{sample}} \rho_{Fe}V + \left(\frac{F}{D} - \frac{m_{carbon}}{M_{sample}}\rho_C\right)zh + C_{initial}$
We can find $C_{initial}$ by using the given initial concentration:
$C_{initial} = 0.1 wt\% = 0.0001$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{m_{carbon}}{M_{sample}} \rho_{Fe}V + \left(\frac{F}{D} - \frac{m_{carbon}}{M_{sample}}\rho_C\right)zh + 0.0001$
We can find $M_{sample}$ by using the given volume and density of iron:
$M_{sample} = \rho_{Fe}V$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{m_{carbon}}{V} + \left(\frac{F}{D} - \frac{m_{carbon}}{M_{sample}}\rho_C\right)zh + 0.0001$
We can find $m_{carbon}$ by using the given mass of carbon in the sample:
$m_{carbon} = 0.1 kg$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{0.1}{V} + \left(\frac{F}{D} - \frac{0.1}{\rho_{Fe}V}\rho_C\right)zh + 0.0001$
We can find $F$ by using the given mass flow rate and area:
$F = \dot{m}_{carbon}A = 1 kg/h * \pi (5mm)^2 / 4 = 0.07854 m^3/s$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{0.1}{V} + \left(\frac{0.07854}{D} - \frac{0.1}{\rho_{Fe}V}\rho_C\right)zh + 0.0001$
We can find $D$ by using the given diffusivity:
$D = 6.0*10^{-11} m^2/s$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{0.1}{V} + \left(\frac{0.07854}{6.0*10^{-11}} - \frac{0.1}{\rho_{Fe}V}\rho_C\right)zh + 0.0001$
We can find $\rho_C$ by using the given density of carbon:
$\rho_C = 2.5 g/cm^3 = 2.5*10^3 kg/m^3$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{0.1}{V} + \left(\frac{0.07854}{6.0*10^{-11}} - \frac{0.1}{\rho_{Fe}V}*2.5*10^3\right)zh + 0.0001$
We can find $\rho_{Fe}$ by using the given density of iron:
$\rho_{Fe} = 7.8 g/cm^3 = 7.8*10^3 kg/m^3$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{0.1}{V} + \left(\frac{0.07854}{6.0*10^{-11}} - \frac{0.1}{(7.8*10^3)*V}*2.5*10^3\right)zh + 0.0001$
We can find $V$ by using the given volume of the sample:
$V = \pi (diameter/2)^2 * length = \pi (5cm/2)^2 * 5cm = 28.2743*10^{-3} m^3$
Substituting this into the equation for $C(z)$, we get:
$C(z) = \frac{0.1}{28.2743*10^{-3}} + \left(\frac{0.07854}{6.0*10^{-11}} - \frac{0.1}{(7.8*10^3)*(28.2743*10^{-3})}*2.5*10^3\right)zh + 0.0001$
Simplifying this expression, we get:
$C(z) = 0.0352 + \left(\frac{0.0278}{z} - 0.00046*h\right)$
We can find the depth $z$ at which the concentration is 0.46 wt% by setting $C(z) = 0.46$:
$0.46 = 0.0352 + \left(\frac{0.0278}{z} - 0.00046*h\right)$
Solving for $z$, we get:
$z = \frac{0.0278}{0.0119} = 2.2532 cm$
To find the carburization time, we can use the diffusion equation:
$\frac{dC}{dt} = D\frac{d^2C}{dz^2}$
We can assume that the concentration varies linearly with depth at the surface, so we can approximate the initial condition as:
$C(0,t) = C_0 + kt$
where $C_0$ is the initial concentration and $k$ is a constant. We can also assume that the boundary condition at the bottom of the sample is:
$C(\infty,t) = C_1$
where $C_1$ is the final concentration. We can use separation of variables to solve this differential equation:
$C(z,t) = X(z)T(t)$
Substituting this into the diffusion equation and separating variables, we get:
$\frac{d^2X}{dz^2} = -\lambda^2 X$
and
$\frac{dT}{dt} = \lambda^2 D T$
The general solution for $X(z)$ is:
$X(z) = A\sin(\lambda z) + B\cos(\lambda z)$
where $A$ and $B$ are constants. We can use the boundary conditions to find $\lambda$:
$\sin(\lambda d) = 0 \implies \lambda d = n\pi$
and
$\cos(\lambda d) = \frac{C_1 - C_0}{C_0} \implies \lambda d = \arccos(\frac{C_1 - C_0}{C_0})$
where $d$ is the thickness of the sample. We can assume that $\lambda d$ is much smaller than 1, so we can use the Taylor series expansion:
$\arccos(x) \approx x + \frac{1}{2}x^3 + O(x^5)$
Substituting this into the expression for $\lambda$, we get:
$\lambda d = \frac{C_1 - C_0}{C_0} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{C_1 - C_0}{C_0}\right)^3 + O\left(\left(\frac{C_1 - C_0}{C_0}\right)^5\right)$
We can approximate the time evolution of the concentration as:
$T(t) = C_0 + kt - \frac{\lambda^2 D}{\pi^2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n \sin(n\pi z/d)}{n^2}$
where $A_n$ are constants that depend on the initial condition. We can use the boundary conditions to find $A_n$:
$A_n = \frac{2C_1 - C_0}{n\pi}\cos(n\pi h/d)$
Substituting this into the expression for $T(t)$, we get:
$T(t) = C_0 + kt - \frac{\lambda^2 D}{\pi^2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(2C_1 - C_0)\cos(n\pi h/d)}{n^3}\sin^2(n\pi z/d)$
We can approximate the carburization time as the time it takes for the concentration to reach 50% of the final value at the center of the sample:
$t_{carb} = \frac{C_0 - C_1/2}{\lambda^2 D}$
Substituting the values we have found, we get:
$t_{carb} = \frac{(0.46-0.0352)/2}{(\pi/d)^2 * (6.0*10^{-11})} \approx 1.78*10^5 s \approx 54.3 hours$
Therefore, the carburization time is approximately 54.3 hours.",,,0,

Explanence:
The given information can be used to calculate the corrosion current density using the Tafel equation. The Tafel equation relates the logarithm of the current density to the overpotential (η). In this case, we are given the anodic polarization as 0.4 V and the Tafel slope as 0.1 V/decade.
The Tafel equation is:
η = b log(i/i0)
where η is overpotential, i is current density, and i0 is exchange current density.
We can rearrange this equation to find the current density (i) in terms of overpotential (η):
i = i0 * 10^(η/b)

(Round off to 1 decimal). "," [ ]
To find the time taken for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 600 K, we first need to find the diffusivity of A at 600 K using the given equation.
$D_A$ = $(D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_(B)T})$
We are given that $D_A$ = 1.6*$10^(-12}$ m²/s at 300 K. We need to find $D_A$ at 600 K.
First, let's calculate the exponent:
$-{E_a/k_(B)T}$ = $-{(0.3 eV)/(8.62*10^{-5}eV/K * 600 K)}$ = $-{0.0407}$
Now we can find $D_A$ at 600 K:
$D_A$ = $(1.6*10^{-12} m²/s)*exp(-0.0407)$ = $1.35*10^{-12} m²/s$ (rounded to one decimal place)
Now we can use Fick's second law to find the time it takes for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 600 K:
$C(x,t) = C_0 + (M/V)*int_{0}^{t} D_A * (dc/dx) dt$
where $C(x,t)$ is the concentration of A at position x and time t, $C_0$ is the initial concentration, M is the amount of A diffused, V is the volume of the solid, and $dc/dx$ is the concentration gradient.
We are given that the concentration gradient is constant and equal to $1.2*10^{-5} mol/m^3$. We can find the amount of A diffused by using the initial concentration and the final concentration (which is zero at a depth of 10 μm):
$M = C_0 * V$
Now we can set up the equation:
$C(x,t) = C_0 + (M/V)*int_{0}^{t} D_A * (dc/dx) dt = 0$
We can solve for t using separation of variables and the initial condition $C(x,0) = C_0$:
$t = (V/(D_A * (dc/dx)^2))*ln((C_0/(C_0-M/V))) = (10^{-6} m^3 / (1.35*10^{-12} m²/s * (1.2*10^{-5} mol/m^3)^2))*ln((C_0/(0-M/V))) \approx 4.7*10^4 s$
Therefore, the time taken for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 600 K is approximately $4.7*10^4$ seconds or $13.8$ hours (rounded to one decimal place).

Explanation: 
P. Electrode polarization refers to the change in potential difference between an electrode and a reference electrode when a current is passed through it. This phenomenon is also known as overvoltage or overpotential. So, option (B) is correct for P.
Q. Passivity is a state of protection from corrosion where the metal forms a stable oxide film on its surface. This protective film prevents further corrosion. So, option (A) is incorrect because passivity is not related to intergranular attack or selective leaching. Instead, it is related to the formation of a surface oxide film (option 4).
R. Selective leaching is a type of corrosion where certain elements are preferentially removed from the metal, leaving behind a porous and weakened structure. This can be caused by differences in the solubility or electronegativity of different elements in the alloy. So, option (C) is incorrect because grain boundary precipitation is not related to selective leaching. Instead, it is a type of corrosion that occurs at the boundaries between grains in a metal, causing intergranular attack (option 2).

The diffusion coefficient through a lattice ($D_L$) is generally smaller than the diffusion coefficient along grain boundaries ($D_(GB)$ ) because grain boundaries provide more sites for atomic jumps to occur due to their higher concentration of defects and irregularities. The diffusion coefficient along free surfaces ($D_S$) is typically even larger than $D_(GB)$ because there are no lattice constraints at all, allowing atoms to move freely in three dimensions.

Explanation:
The rate of diffusion, $J$, is given by Fick's first law as:
$J = -D \frac{dC}{dx}$
where $D$ is the diffusivity and $\frac{dC}{dx}$ is the concentration gradient.
At steady state, the flux is constant throughout the system, so we can write:
$-D_1\frac{dC_1}{dx} = -D_2\frac{dC_2}{dx}$
Dividing both sides by $D_1$ and rearranging, we get:
$\frac{dC_1}{dx} = \frac{D_2}{D_1}\frac{dC_2}{dx}$
Integrating both sides with respect to $x$, we get:
$\int_{C_{1i}}^{C_{1f}} dC_1 = \frac{D_2}{D_1} \int_{C_{2i}}^{C_{2f}} dC_2$
where $C_{1i}$ and $C_{1f}$ are the initial and final concentrations of the alloy at temperature $T_1$, and $C_{2i}$ and $C_{2f}$ are the corresponding concentrations at temperature $T_2$.
We can assume that the initial and final concentrations are the same, so we have:
$\Delta C = C_{1f} - C_{1i} = C_{2f} - C_{2i}$
Using the given information, we have:
$\frac{\Delta C}{10 hours} = \frac{D_2}{D_1}\frac{\Delta C}{t_{hom, 2}}$
where $t_{hom, 1} = 10 hours$ and $t_{hom, 2}$ is the time required for homogenization at temperature $T_2$.
Solving for $t_{hom, 2}$, we get:
$t_{hom, 2} = \frac{D_1}{D_2} t_{hom, 1}$
Substituting the given values, we have:
$t_{hom, 2} = \frac{10^{-18}}{10^{-19}} (10 hours) = 10^3 (10 hours) = 10,003 hours$
Therefore, the answer is [10003]. However, it's important to note that this result seems implausible, as it suggests that homogenization takes over three orders of magnitude longer at the higher temperature. This may indicate an error in the given information or assumptions.",,,0,

At 300°C and $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd in $mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd is? (answer up to one decimal place)"," ___________ mm^3/kg
Explanation: The solubility of a gas in a metal can be calculated using Henry's Law, which states that the amount of a gas dissolved in a liquid or solid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above the solution. In this case, we are given the solubility at one pressure and need to find it at another pressure.
We can use the following equation:
$S_2 = S_1 * (P_2 / P_1)$
where $S_1$ is the solubility at the first pressure, $S_2$ is the solubility at the second pressure, $P_1$ is the first pressure, and $P_2$ is the second pressure.
First, we need to convert the given pressures to atm:
$P_(H_2)$ = 1 atm (given)
$P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm
Now, we can calculate the solubility at the second pressure:
$S_2 = 1.64 * 10^(4) mm^3/kg * (0.09 atm / 1 atm)$
$S_2 = 1.64 * 10^(4) mm^3/kg * 0.09$
$S_2 = 1.48 * 10^(4) mm^3/kg$ (rounded to one decimal place)
Therefore, the answer is approximately $1.5 * 10^(4)$ mm^3/kg. However, since the question asks for an answer up to one decimal place, we can round down to $1.4 * 10^(4)$ mm^3/kg as a more conservative estimate.

A copper-aluminium diffusion couple develops a certain concentration profile after an isothermal treatment at 600°C for 10 hours. The time(in hours to 1 decimal place) required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is," ___________
Explanation:
The interdiffusion coefficient (D) is a measure of how fast atoms diffuse between two metals in contact. It is given by Fick's second law, which states that the flux of diffusing species is proportional to the concentration gradient.
At constant temperature and assuming one-dimensional diffusion, the concentration profile (C(x)) can be described by the following equation:
C(x,t) = C1 + (C2 - C1) * erf(x/(4*D*t)^(1/2))
Where C1 and C2 are the initial concentrations of copper and aluminium respectively, x is the distance from the interface, t is time, and erf() is the error function.
To find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C as that obtained at 600°C for 10 hours, we need to solve the above equation for both temperatures and set them equal to each other:
C(x,t1) = C(x,t2)
C1 + (C2 - C1) * erf(x/(4*D1*t1)^(1/2)) = C1 + (C2 - C1) * erf(x/(4*D2*t2)^(1/2))
Subtracting the first term from both sides and simplifying:
(C2 - C1) * [erf(x/(4*D1*t1)^(1/2)) - erf(x/(4*D2*t2)^(1/2))] = 0
Since the left-hand side of the equation is not always zero, we have:
erf(x/(4*D1*t1)^(1/2)) = erf(x/(4*D2*t2)^(1/2))
Using the property that erf(-x) = -erf(x), we can write:
|erf(x/(4*D1*t1)^(1/2)) - erf(x/(4*D2*t2)^(1/2))| = 0
Since erf() is a monotonically increasing function, this implies that:
x/(4*D1*t1)^(1/2) = x/(4*D2*t2)^(1/2)
Taking the fourth power of both sides and simplifying:
(x^2 * D1 * t1) = (x^2 * D2 * t2)
Dividing both sides by x^2:
D1 * t1 = D2 * t2
Therefore, the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is:
t1 = (D2/D1) * t2 = (8*$10^(-13)/4*$10^(-14)) * 10 hours = ___________ hours
Answer: [2.5] hours

Equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen (in wt.%, rounded off to three decimal places) in pure liquid iron, exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K, is?"," [_____, ______, ______]
Explanation: To find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron, we need to use Sieverts' law and the given equation for $log_(10)K_[n]$ as a function of temperature.
First, let's calculate the value of $log_(10)K_[N]$ at 1873 K:
$log_(10)K_[N] = [-518/T - 1.063]$
$= [-518/(1873) - 1.063]$
$= [-0.274 - 1.063]$
$= -1.337$
Now, we can use Sieverts' law to find the equilibrium concentration of nitrogen:
$log_(10)[h_N] = log_(10)K_[N] + log_(10)[X_{N}]$
where $[X_{N}]$ is the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in wt.%.
Solving for $[X_{N}]$:
$log_(10)[X_{N}] = log_(10)K_[N] - log_(10)[h_N]$
Since we don't know the value of $[h_N]$ in this problem, we can only find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen as a logarithmic value. To get the answer in wt.%, we need to take the antilogarithm of the result. However, without knowing the value of $[h_N]$, we cannot do that.
Therefore, the answer is an empty list [ ], since we cannot provide the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen as a numerical value in this case.",,,0,

Find value of y.(answer rounded off to the nearest integer)."," To find the flux, we can use Fick's first law which states that the flux (J) is proportional to the concentration gradient. The concentration gradient in this case is given by:
dC/dx = 2*$a_1*x + a_2$
Substituting $𝑎_1$ and $𝑎_2$ values, we get:
dC/dx = 2*(1)*$x^(2) + 1*x$ = $2x^(2) + x$
Now, using Fick's first law, we have:
J = -D * (dC/dx)
where D is the diffusion coefficient. Substituting the values, we get:
J = -3*$10^(-3)*($2*(2)^(2) + 1*(2))$ = -3*$10^(-3)*(4+2) = -3*$10^(-3)*6 = -$18.6*$10^(-3)
To find the flux at $𝑥=2mm$, we need to find the concentration at that point and then use Fick's first law. We have:
C = 1*$(2)^(2) + 1*2 = 5
So, the flux at $𝑥=2mm$ is given by:
J = -D * (dC/dx) = -3*$10^(-3)*(dC/dx)|_{x=2}
To find dC/dx at x=2, we differentiate the given expression with respect to x:
dC/dx = 4*$x + 1$
Substituting $x=2$, we get:
dC/dx|_x=2 = 4*(2) + 1 = 5
So, the flux at $𝑥=2mm$ is given by:
J = -3*$10^(-3)*(5) = -$15*$10^(-3)
To find y, we need to make J equal to $-y*10^{-3}$. So, we have:
$-$15*$10^(-3) = $-y*10^(-3)$
Solving for y, we get:
y = 15

Explanation:
(i) Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field.

Therefore, the magnetic susceptibility of a diamagnetic material is negative when expressed as a fraction or positive when expressed as a dimensionless quantity relative to a vacuum (which has a magnetic susceptibility of zero). However, it's important to note that diamagnetic materials are less magnetically susceptible than paramagnetic materials.
(ii) Magnetic susceptibility is positive for a paramagnetic material. In paramagnetic materials, the magnetic moments of individual atoms are aligned in the presence of an applied magnetic field, resulting in a net magnetic moment for the material as a whole. This leads to a positive magnetic susceptibility when expressed as a fraction or a dimensionless quantity relative to a vacuum.
(iii) Magnetic susceptibility is negative for an antiferromagnetic material. In antiferromagnetic materials, the magnetic moments of neighboring atoms are aligned in opposite directions, resulting in a net magnetic moment of zero for the material as a whole.

The electric current(in amperes) required to generate the necessary magnetic field is?  (round off to 1 decimal place)," ___________ A
Explanation:
The coercivity of a magnet is the minimum magnetic field strength required to demagnetize it completely. In this case, we are given that the iron bar magnet has a coercivity of 7000 A $m^(-1)$. We need to find the electric current required to generate a magnetic field inside the solenoid that can demagnetize the magnet.
First, let's calculate the maximum magnetic field strength that can be generated by the solenoid using its number of turns and length:
$B = \frac{\mu_0 * I}{l}$
where $B$ is the magnetic field strength, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^-7 T m A^-1), $I$ is the electric current, and $l$ is the length of the solenoid.
We want to find the current required to generate a magnetic field strength greater than the coercivity of the magnet:
$I > \frac{B * l}{\mu_0}$

The magneteic moments of cations on octahedral sites are antiparallel with respect to those on tetrahedral sites. Atomic number of Fe is 26 and that of O is 8. The saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_(3)O_(4)$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons ($µ_B$) will be ? Ignore contribution from orbital magnetic moments. ," [30]
Explanation: In an inverse spinel structure, there are two types of cations - A and B. Fe is the B-site cation and O is the anion (non-magnetic). Since 1/2 of octahedral sites are occupied by Fe and other half by non-Fe cations, the total magnetic moment due to Fe will be given by:
$M_{Fe} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times \frac{5}{2} \times \mu_B = 10 \mu_B$
Since all magnetic moments are antiparallel, the total saturation magnetic moment per formula unit will be twice this value:
$M_{sat} = 2 \times M_{Fe} = 2 \times 10 \mu_B = 20 \mu_B$
However, we need to convert Fe's atomic number (Z=26) into its number of unpaired electrons ($n_{unpaired}$) using the formula:
$n_{unpaired} = Z - N$ where $N$ is the number of electrons in a neutral atom. For Fe, $N = 2 \times 8 + 14 = 26$. So, $n_{unpaired} = 26 - 26 = 0$. This means that Fe does not contribute to the magnetic moment in this case as it is fully ionized and all its electrons are paired.
Therefore, the total saturation magnetic moment per formula unit comes only from the non-Fe cations occupying the octahedral sites. Since there are 8 such sites and each has a magnetic moment of $\frac{5}{2} \mu_B$, the total magnetic moment is:
$M_{sat} = 8 \times \frac{5}{2} \mu_B = 10 \mu_B$
Since we have ignored contribution from orbital magnetic moments, our answer should be twice the magnetic moment of one Fe ion, which is $2 \times 10 \mu_B = 20 \mu_B$. However, since Fe does not contribute to the magnetic moment in this case, our final answer should be half of that, i.e., $M_{sat} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \mu_B = 10 \mu_B$. But since the question asks for the saturation magnetic moment per formula unit, we need to multiply this by 2. Therefore, our final answer is:
$M_{sat} = 2 \times 10 \mu_B = 20 \mu_B$
But due to a mistake in the explanation above, the correct answer should be $M_{sat} = 30 \mu_B$. This is because there are actually two formula units in one unit cell of $Fe_(3)O_(4)$, each contributing a magnetic moment of $20 \mu_B$. So, the total saturation magnetic moment per unit cell is $2 \times 20 \mu_B = 40 \mu_B$, and since there are two formula units in one unit cell, the total saturation magnetic moment per formula unit is $\frac{1}{2} \times 40 \mu_B = 20 \mu_B$. But we made an error by multiplying this by 2 instead of 1 to get the final answer. The correct final answer should be $M_{sat} = 30 \mu_B$.
Therefore, the answer is: [30]",,,0,

Explanation:
The magnetic moment ($\mu$) and mass ($m$) of the magnet are given. We can find the volume ($V$) using the density ($\rho$).
$V = \frac{m}{\rho}$
Substituting the values, we get:
$V = \frac{50g}{7.2g/cm^3} = 6.94 cm^3$
The magnetic moment is given in Am^2 and the mass in g. To find the intensity of magnetization ($I$), we use the formula:
$I = \frac{\mu}{V}$
Substituting the values, we get:
$I = \frac{4.2\times 10^{-7}Am^2}{6.94cm^3} = 6.15\times 10^(−3) Am^(−1)$

Explanation: The saturation magnetization of a ferromagnetic material can be calculated using the Lorentz formula: M_s = N * μ_m where N is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume and μ_m is the magnetic moment per atom. Since we know the saturation magnetization, we can find the magnetic moment per atom by rearranging the formula: μ_m = M_s / (N) We are given that the lattice parameter is 0.2 nm, which corresponds to an FCC lattice with a density of N = 5.89 * $10^{29}$ atoms/m^3. Substituting the values, we get: μ_m = (600 * $10^3$ A/m) / (5.89 * $10^{29}$ atoms/m^3) = 1.04 * $10^{-23}$ J/T = 2.02 * $10^{57}$ J/T * (1 Bohr magneton / 9.27 * $10^{-24}$ J/T) = 2.02 * $10^{57}$ Bohr magnetons Therefore, the answer is [B, 2.02 * $10^{57}$].",,,0,

Given: 𝜇𝐵 = 9.273 × $10^(-24)$ A $m^2$, Lattice parameter of BCC iron is 0.287 nm Note: kA is kiloAmperes"," ___________
Hint: The saturation magnetization (Ms) can be calculated using the formula Ms = NμB, where N is the number of Fe atoms per unit volume and μB is the magnetic moment per Fe atom. First, find N using the lattice parameter and Avogadro's number. Then calculate Ms.
Answer: [3.52]
Explanation:
First, we need to find the number of Fe atoms per unit volume (N). The formula for the volume of a BCC unit cell is given by V = a³, where a is the lattice parameter. We are given that a = 0.287 nm. Using Avogadro's number (6.022 × $10^{23}$ atoms/mol), we can find N:
N = (number of Fe atoms in 1 mol) / (volume of 1 unit cell)
N = (6.022 × $10^{23}$ atoms/mol) / (V)
N = (6.022 × $10^{23}$ atoms/mol) / (a³)
N = (6.022 × $10^{23}$ atoms/mol) / (0.287 nm)³
N ≈ 8.49 × $10^{28}$ m⁻³
Now, we can calculate the saturation magnetization using the given magnetic moment per Fe atom (μB = 2 × 𝜇𝐵 = 2 × 9.273 × $10^(-24)$ A $m^2$ = 1.8546 × $10^(-22}$ A $m^2$).
Ms = NμB
Ms = (8.49 × $10^{28}$ m⁻³) × (1.8546 × $10^(-22)$ A $m^2$)
Ms ≈ 1.56 × $10^5$ J/T
To convert this value to kA/m, we need to divide by the magnetic constant (μ₀ = 4π × $10^(-7)$ T m/A).
Ms = (1.56 × $10^5$ J/T) / (4π × $10^(-7)$ T m/A)
Ms ≈ 3.52 × $10^3$ A/m
Rounded off to one decimal place, the answer is approximately 3.52 kAm-1 or 3.52 kA/m.",,,0,

Explanation: The magnetic moment of a single domain in a ferromagnetic material can be calculated using the formula: M = (2 * mu_m * N / V) where, M is the magnetization, mu_m is the magnetic moment per unit volume and N is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume. Given that the number of magnetic moments per unit volume is equal to the number of atoms per unit volume, which can be calculated using the lattice parameter (assuming a simple cubic lattice), we have: N = (1 / a^3) where a is the lattice constant. Substituting the given values, we get: M = (2 * mu_m * N / V) => mu_m = (M * V / 2 * N) => mu_m = (M * (1 / a^3)) => mu_m = (1700 * 10^(-3) * (1 / (0.287 * 10^-9)^3)) => mu_m = 4.65 * 10^-23 $Am^2$ => x = mu_m / (1.6 * 10^-24) => x = 4.65 (rounded off to one decimal place).

Explanation: In Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), both secondary electrons (SEs) and backscattered electrons (BSEs) are used to form images. The resolution of an image refers to the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced features. The SEs are emitted when an electron interacts with the sample surface, while BSEs are produced when primary electrons collide with inner shell electrons and are ejected from the atom as a result.
The larger sampling volume of BSEs is the reason for their poorer resolution compared to SEs. This is because BSEs originate from a deeper region within the sample, which results in a larger area being probed by each electron.

$ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2\Delta P}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(p_1-p_2)}{\rho}} $

where $p_1$ is the pressure at the nozzle entrance and $p_2$ is the atmospheric pressure. Since the nozzle discharge coefficient is given, we can find $\Delta P$ using:

$ \Delta P = \frac{\dot{m}^2}{A^2} (1-\eta)^2 $

where $\eta$ is the nozzle discharge coefficient.

Substituting the values of $\rho$, $A$, and $\eta$, we get:

$ \Delta P = \frac{(0.8)^2}{(30\times 10^{-3})^2} (1-0.8)^2 = 5.47\times 10^6 Pa $

Now, we can find the velocity of liquid metal at the nozzle exit:

$ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2(5.47\times 10^6)}{7000}} = 38.9 m/s $

The mass flow rate through the nozzle is:

$ \dot{m} = \rho Av_e = (7000)(3.14\times 10^{-2})(38.9) = 658.3 kg/s $

Explanation: According to Buckingham Pi theorem, the number of independent dimensionless variables required to describe a physical system is equal to the difference between the number of dimensions in the input variables and the number of dimensions in the output variable. In this case, we have 5 input variables (Pressure, Velocity, Size, Density, Viscosity) with dimensions M$L^(-1)T^(-2)$, $LT^(-1)$, L, M $L^(-3)$, and M$L^(-1)T^(-1)$ respectively. The output variable is not explicitly stated in the question but it can be assumed that it's a function of Pressure, Velocity, Size, Density, and Viscosity. Since these variables have dimensions M, L, T, we have 3 dimensions (mass, length, time) for the input variables and 1 dimension for the output variable. Therefore, according to Buckingham Pi theorem, the number of independent dimensionless variables required is 3 dimensions for the input variables - 1 dimension for the output variable = 2 dimensions. However, in this question, there are 5 input variables given, so the correct answer is (C) 4 independent dimensionless variables are needed to describe this system.

[The pressure drop can be calculated using Darcy's law as ΔP = μQ/KA, where μ is the dynamic viscosity of gas, Q is the volumetric flow rate, K is the permeability and A is the cross-sectional area. We need to find the volumetric flow rate first.

First, we can calculate the Darcy's velocity $v_d$ using the given pressure drop and bed height:

$v_d = \frac{\Delta P}{g\rho d} = \frac{300\times10^3\times9.81}{1000\times9.81\times d}$

Solving for $d$, we get:

$d = \sqrt{\frac{300\times10^3}{g\rho}} = 2.54\ m$

Now, we can calculate the cross-sectional area A of the bed using the given permeability and bed height:

$A = \frac{V_b}{\Delta h} = \frac{d^2}{K}$

Substituting the values, we get:

$A = \frac{(2.54)^2}{0.8\times10^{-4}\times9.81} = 3.67\ m^2$

Now, we can calculate the volumetric flow rate Q using Darcy's law:

$Q = \frac{A\Delta P}{\mu} = \frac{(3.67)(300\times10^3)}{(1.8\times10^{-5})}$

Solving for Q, we get:

Explanation: The volume of the liquid metal that enters the mold in one second can be calculated using the cross-sectional area and velocity of the stream. Since the acceleration due to gravity is constant, we can use the equation for the velocity of a freely falling object: $v = \sqrt{2gh}$ where g is the acceleration due to gravity, h is the height from which the liquid metal falls, and v is the final velocity. In this case, h = 0.5m and g = 9.8 $m.s^(-2)$. Solving for v, we get v = 3.13 $m.s^(-1)$.

By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?"," [The time can be calculated using Stokes Law which relates terminal velocity of a particle to its size and density. The equation is given by v = (2*g*r^2)/9*η, where g is acceleration due to gravity, r is radius of the particle and η is viscosity. First we need to find the terminal velocity of alumina particles using Stokes Law.
Terminal Velocity of Alumina Particles = (2*g*r^2)/(9*η) = (2*(9.81 m/s^2)*(0.00005m)^2)/(9*(6*$10^-3 kg/ms)) = 0.0047 m/s
Using this terminal velocity, we can calculate the time taken for the particle to rise from a depth of 2m using the equation t = h/(v + w), where h is height and w is the upward acceleration due to buoyancy force. The upward acceleration due to buoyancy force is given by w = (Δρ*g)/ρ, where Δρ is difference in density between steel and alumina.
Difference in Density = 7000 kg/$m^3$ - 3650 kg/$m^3$ = 3350 kg/$m^3$
Upward Acceleration due to Buoyancy Force = (Δρ*g)/ρ = (3350 kg/$m^3$*(9.81 m/s^2))/(7000 kg/$m^3$) = 0.0481 m/s

To find the terminal velocity, we can use Stokes' law and equate it to the net force acting on the sphere due to gravity. The net force is given by Archimedes' principle as the difference between the weight of the sphere and the buoyant force.
First, let's calculate the buoyant force:
Buoyant force = Density of liquid steel * Volume of displaced fluid
Volume of displaced fluid = (4/3) * 𝜋 * (D/2)^3
Substituting given values:
Buoyant force = 7900 kg $m^(-3)$ * (4/3) * 𝜋 * (50 µm / 2)^3
= 1.68 * 10^-11 N
Now, let's calculate the weight of the sphere:
Weight = Density of inclusion * Volume of sphere * Acceleration due to gravity
Volume of sphere = (4/3) * 𝜋 * (D/2)^3
Substituting given values:
Weight = 2500 kg $m^(-3)$ * (4/3) * 𝜋 * (50 µm / 2)^3 * 9.8 m $s^(-2)$
= 1.62 * 10^-10 N
Now, we can find the terminal velocity by equating the net force to zero:
Net force = Weight - Buoyant force
Terminal velocity = | Net force / Density of liquid steel |
Substituting given values and calculated results:
Net force = (1.62 * 10^-10 N - 1.68 * 10^-11 N)
= 5.2 * 10^-11 N
Terminal velocity = | 5.2 * 10^-11 N / 7900 kg $m^(-3)$ |
= 6.4 * 10^-5 m/s
To convert to mm$s^(-1)$, we multiply by 10^3:

Explanation:
To find the minimum pH at which $Fe^(+3)$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$, we need to use the solubility product expression and the given concentration of $Fe^(+3)$.
The solubility product expression for $Fe(OH)_3$ is:
$$K_{sp} = [Fe^{3+}] \times [OH^{-}]^3$$
Assuming activity equals concentration, we have:
$$[Fe^{3+}] = 10^{-3} M$$
We need to find the minimum value of $[OH^{-}]$ that will make $K_{sp}$ equal to or less than $(10^{-3})^2$.
Using the given solubility product constant, we have:
$$10^{-39} = (10^{-3})^2 \times [OH^{-}]^3$$
Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, we get:
$$-39 = 2 \times \log_{10}[OH^{-}] + 3 \times \log_{10}[OH^{-}]$$
Simplifying, we have:
$$-39 = 5 \times \log_{10}[OH^{-}]$$
Taking the exponent of both sides, we get:
$$[OH^{-}] = 10^{-7.8}$$

Miscellaneous,7,G-META-20-44,NUM,41,"Given, density of oxide is 6.5 $g.cm^(-3)$. A metal oxidizes at 1200K with a parabolic rate constant of 3* $10^(-6)g^(2).cm^(-4).s^(-1)$. Time taken(in seconds) for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is?(round off to two decimal places). "," ___________
Explanation:
The rate equation for parabolic diffusion is given by:
dM/dt = k * (A - M)^(1/2)
Where,
dM/dt = rate of change of mass of the oxide film with time,
k = rate constant,
A = initial area of the metal exposed to the reactant gas, and
M = mass of the oxide film formed at any given time.
We are given that the density of the oxide is 6.5 g/cm^3, and we need to find the thickness of the oxide film that grows to a mass of 2 µm. First, let's convert the thickness to mass using the given density:
Mass of oxide film = Density * Volume
Volume = Thickness^3
Thickness = (Mass / Density)^(1/3)
Substituting the given value of density and finding the thickness:
Thickness = (2*$10^-6 g / 6.5 g/cm^3)^(1/3)
Thickness = $4.78 * 10^-4 cm
Now, we can find the initial area A using the given thickness and assuming that the metal piece is a cube:
A = (Side length)^2 = (Thickness / Density)^(2/3) * (Side length)^2
Substituting the values:
A = ($4.78 * 10^-4 cm / 6.5 g/cm^3)^(2/3) * (Side length)^2
Assuming Side length = 1 cm, we get A = $1.29 * 10^-3 cm^2
Now, we can use the rate equation to find the time taken for the oxide film to grow to this thickness:
dM/dt = k * (A - M)^(1/2)
Rearranging to find dt:
dt = (dM / [k * (A - M)^(1/2)])^2
Substituting the given values and solving for dt:
dt = ($[2*$10^-6 g - $4.78*10^-6 g] / [3*10^-12 g^2.cm^(-4).s^(-1) * (($1.29*10^-3 cm^2 - $4.78*10^-6 g/cm^3)^(1/2)]^2$)
dt = 5.61 * 10^5 s
Rounding off to two decimal places, the answer is:
Answer: [5.61 * 10^5]
Note: The given density of oxide was in units of g/cm^3, but the thickness and side length were given in cm. To ensure consistency, we converted the thickness to mass using the given density before calculating the initial area A.",,,0,
