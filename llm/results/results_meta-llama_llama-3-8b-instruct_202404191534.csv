Material Manufacturing;11;G-META-12-10;MCQS;22;Floatation beneficiation is based on the principle of  (A) Mineral surface hydrophobicity (B) Gravity difference (C) Chemical reactivity (D) Particle size difference;"The correct answer is:

(B) Gravity difference

Floatation beneficiation is a process that separates minerals based on their density and buoyancy in water. The principle is that minerals with a lower density than water will float to the surface, while those with a higher density will sink. The process uses a mixture of water and a surfactant, such as frothing agents, to create a froth that traps the mineral particles and allows them to be skimmed off the surface.";B;A;0;
Material Applications;24;G-META-12-11;MCQS;18;Copper can be reduced from acidic copper sulphate solution by  (A) Silver (B) Iron (C) Carbon (D) Lead;"The correct answer is:

(B) Iron

Explanation: Copper can be reduced from acidic copper sulphate solution by iron. This is because iron is more reactive than copper and can displace copper from its solution. The reaction is:

Fe (iron) + CuSO4 (copper sulphate) → FeSO4 (iron sulphate) + Cu (copper)

This reaction is known as displacement reaction.";B;B;1;
Material Manufacturing;12;G-META-12-12;MCQS;15;Which one is NOT an agglomeration process?  (A) Nodulizing (B) Briquetting (C) Roasting (D) Pelletizing;"The correct answer is:

(C) Roasting

Roasting is a thermal process used to heat and dry materials, but it is not an agglomeration process. Agglomeration processes are used to bind particles together to form larger masses or aggregates, and the other options are all examples of agglomeration processes:

* Nodulizing: a process that forms nodules or pellets from powders or granules
* Briquetting: a process that forms briquettes or pucks from powders or granules
* Pelletizing: a process that forms pellets from powders or granules

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Roasting.";C;C;1;
Material Manufacturing;13;G-META-12-13;MCQS;20;During LD blow in steelmaking the impurity that gets removed first is  (A) Carbon (B) Phosphorous (C) Manganese (D) Silicon;"During LD (Linz-Donawitz) blowing in steelmaking, the impurity that gets removed first is:

**Silicon (D)**

Here's why:

1. Silicon is the most reactive impurity in steel and is easily removed by the oxygen lance.
2. Silicon reacts with oxygen to form silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is a slag-forming oxide that floats on top of the molten steel.
3. As the oxygen lance is blown into the bath, the silicon reacts with oxygen and is removed as a slag, allowing the steel to become more pure.

The other options are not correct because:

* Carbon (A) is not typically removed first during LD blowing, as it is a primary component of steel and is not easily removed by oxygen.
* Phosphorus (B) is a more difficult impurity to remove and is typically removed later in the steelmaking process, often through the use of aluminum or calcium.
* Manganese (C) is not typically removed first during LD blowing, as it is a common alloying element in steel and is not easily removed by oxygen.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Silicon.";D;D;1;
Thermodynamics;44;G-META-12-14;MCQS;44;During the solidification of a pure metal, it was found that dendrites are formed. Assuming that the liquid-solid interface is at the melting temperature, the temperature from the interface into the liquid  (A) Decreases (B) Increases (C) Remains constant (D) Increases and then decreases;"Let's analyze the situation:

During the solidification of a pure metal, the liquid-solid interface is at the melting temperature. As we move away from the interface into the liquid, the temperature will decrease due to the heat of fusion being released as the metal solidifies.

The temperature profile will likely follow a characteristic ""frozen layer"" or ""mushy zone"" structure, where the liquid and solid phases coexist. The temperature will decrease as we move away from the interface, as the metal solidifies and releases heat.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) Decreases";A;A;1;
Atomic Structure;44;G-META-12-15;MCQS-NUM;51;A peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern is observed at 2θ = 78°, corresponding to {311} planes of an fcc metal, when the incident beam has a wavelength of 0.154 nm. The lattice parameter of the metal is approximately  (A) 0.6 nm (B) 0.4 nm (C) 0.3 nm (D) 0.2 nm;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray beam, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the angle of incidence.

We are given that the peak corresponds to the {311} planes of an fcc metal, which means that the interplanar spacing d can be calculated using the lattice parameter a:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices.

For the {311} planes, h = 3, k = 1, and l = 1, so:

d = a / √(3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √9 + 1 + 1 = a / √11

We are also given that the incident beam has a wavelength of 0.154 nm, and the peak is observed at 2θ = 78°. We can rearrange the Bragg equation to solve for d:

d = λ / (2sinθ)

Substituting the values, we get:

d = 0.154 nm / (2sin(78°)) = 0.154 nm / (2sin(78°))

Using a calculator to evaluate the sine function, we get:

d ≈ 0.225 nm

Now we can solve for the lattice parameter a:

a = d√11 ≈ 0.225 nm√11 ≈ 0.405 nm

So, the correct answer is:

(B) 0.4 nm";B;B;1;

(B) d/n

The inter-planar spacing of the planes {nh nk nl} is related to the inter-planar spacing of the planes {h k l} by the following equation:

d' = d/n

where d' is the inter-planar spacing of the planes {nh nk nl} and n is an integer.

This is because the planes {nh nk nl} are parallel to the planes {h k l} and are separated by a distance that is n times the distance between the planes {h k l}.";B;B;1;
Electrical Properties;14;G-META-12-17;MCQS;41;As temperature increases, the electrical resistivities of pure metals ($ρ_m$) and intrinsic semiconductors ($ρ_s$) vary as follows  (A) Both $ρ_m$ and $ρ_s$ increase (B) Both $ρ_m$ and $ρ_s$ decrease (C) $ρ_m$ increases and $ρ_s$ decreases (D) $ρ_m$ decreases and $ρ_s$ increases ;"Let's analyze the behavior of electrical resistivity in pure metals and intrinsic semiconductors as temperature increases:

**Pure Metals (ρm)**:

* At low temperatures, the atoms are closely packed, and the electrons are localized, resulting in high resistivity.
* As temperature increases, the atoms vibrate more, causing the electrons to become more mobile and the lattice to expand. This increases the distance between atoms, reducing the scattering of electrons and decreasing the resistivity.
* Above a certain temperature (usually around room temperature), the resistivity of pure metals typically decreases with increasing temperature, following a negative temperature coefficient.

**Intrinsic Semiconductors (ρs)**:

* At low temperatures, the electrons are localized in the valence band, and the resistivity is high.
* As temperature increases, the thermal energy excites some electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, increasing the number of charge carriers and decreasing the resistivity.
* Above a certain temperature (usually around room temperature), the resistivity of intrinsic semiconductors typically decreases with increasing temperature, following a negative temperature coefficient.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

(B) Both m and s decrease

Note that this is a general trend, and there may be exceptions or deviations from this behavior in specific materials or under certain conditions.";B;C;0;
Thermodynamics;45;G-META-12-18;MCQS;54;At equilibrium spacing in a crystalline solid, which of the following is true for net inter-atomic force (F) and potential energy (U)  (A) F is zero and U is zero (B) F is zero and U is minimum (C) F is minimum and U is zero (D) F is minimum and U is minimum;"Let's analyze the options:

A. F is zero and U is zero: This is not possible, as the net inter-atomic force (F) is always zero at equilibrium spacing, but the potential energy (U) is not necessarily zero. At equilibrium, the force is zero because the atoms are not moving, but the potential energy is still present due to the attractive and repulsive forces between the atoms.

B. F is zero and U is minimum: This is correct! At equilibrium spacing, the net inter-atomic force (F) is zero, and the potential energy (U) is at its minimum value. This means that the atoms are in a stable configuration, with the minimum possible energy.

C. F is minimum and U is zero: This is not correct. The net inter-atomic force (F) is not necessarily minimum at equilibrium spacing. In fact, the force can be zero or even negative (attractive) at equilibrium.

D. F is minimum and U is minimum: This is not correct. As mentioned earlier, the potential energy (U) is not necessarily zero at equilibrium spacing, but it is at its minimum value.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. F is zero and U is minimum";B;B;1;
Thermodynamics;46;G-META-12-19;MCQS;26;The property of a material that CANNOT be significantly changed by heat treatment is  (A) Yield strength (B) Ultimate tensile strength (C) Ductility (D) Elastic modulus;"The correct answer is:

(D) Elastic modulus

Elastic modulus is a material property that describes the ratio of stress to strain within the proportional limit of a material. It is a fundamental property that cannot be significantly changed by heat treatment, as it is determined by the material's atomic structure and bonding.

Heat treatment can affect other material properties, such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and ductility, by altering the material's microstructure and defects. However, the elastic modulus remains relatively unchanged.

Here is the correct answer:

* (D) Elastic modulus";D;D;1;
Atomic Structure;46;G-META-12-20;MCQS;63;A unit dislocation splits into two partial dislocations. The correct combination of the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations for a given unit dislocation having Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0] is  (A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1] (B) (a/6)[1 -1 2] and (a/6)[-1 -2 1] (C) (a/6)[1 1 -2] and (a/6)[2 -1 -1] (D) (a/6)[2 1 1] and (a/6)[1 2 -1];"To solve this problem, we need to find the correct combination of partial dislocations that can split a unit dislocation with a Burgers vector of (a/2)[1 -1 0].

A unit dislocation with a Burgers vector of (a/2)[1 -1 0] can be thought of as a dislocation that moves one atom to the right and one atom to the left, resulting in a net displacement of (a/2) in the [1 -1 0] direction.

To split this dislocation into two partial dislocations, we need to find two partial dislocations that, when combined, have a Burgers vector of (a/2)[1 -1 0]. We can do this by considering the possible combinations of partial dislocations that have Burgers vectors that are multiples of the lattice vectors.

The lattice vectors for the given crystal structure are not specified, but we can assume that they are the standard lattice vectors for a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal, which are [100], [010], and [001].

The possible partial dislocations that can split the unit dislocation are:

* A partial dislocation with a Burgers vector of (a/6)[1 1 -2], which moves one atom to the right and one atom to the left, resulting in a net displacement of (a/6) in the [1 1 -2] direction.
* A partial dislocation with a Burgers vector of (a/6)[-1 -2 1], which moves one atom to the left and one atom to the right, resulting in a net displacement of (a/6) in the [-1 -2 1] direction.

The combination of these two partial dislocations has a Burgers vector of:

(a/6)[1 1 -2] + (a/6)[-1 -2 1] = (a/2)[1 -1 0]

This combination of partial dislocations splits the unit dislocation into two partial dislocations with Burgers vectors of (a/6)[1 1 -2] and (a/6)[-1 -2 1].

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]

Note that the correct answer is not one of the options listed, but rather a combination of the two partial dislocations that splits the unit dislocation.";A;A;1;
Mechanical Properties;22;G-META-12-21;MCQS;84;A polymer matrix composite is reinforced with long continuous ceramic fibres aligned in one direction. The Young’s moduli of the matrix and fibres are $E_m$ and $E_f$ respectively, and the volume fraction of the fibres is f. Assuming iso-stress condition, Young’s modulus of the composite $E_C$ in a direction perpendicular to the length of fibres, is given by the expression  (A) $E_C$ = (1-f)$E_m$ + f$E_f$ (B) $E_C$ = f$E_m$ + (1-f)$E_f$ (C) 1/$E_C$ = [(1-f)/$E_m$] + f/$E_f$ (D) 1/$E_C$ = [f/$E_m$] + (1-f)/$E_f$;"To solve this problem, we can use the rule of mixtures to estimate the Young's modulus of the composite (EC) in a direction perpendicular to the length of fibers.

The rule of mixtures states that the composite modulus (EC) is a weighted average of the moduli of the matrix (Em) and fibers (Ef), where the weights are the volume fractions of the matrix (1-f) and fibers (f), respectively.

In this case, since the fibers are aligned in one direction, the composite modulus in a direction perpendicular to the fibers (EC) is given by:

1/EC = (1-f)/Em + f/Ef

This is option (D).

The other options are incorrect:

* Option (A) is the formula for the composite modulus in the direction parallel to the fibers, not perpendicular.
* Option (B) is the formula for the composite modulus when the fibers are randomly distributed, not aligned in one direction.
* Option (C) is the reciprocal of the composite modulus, but not the correct formula for the composite modulus in the direction perpendicular to the fibers.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Thermodynamics;47;G-META-12-33;MCQS-NUM;42;Consider a reaction with activation energy of 8.314 kJ/mol that takes place at 300 K. If the reaction rate is to be tripled, the temperature of the reaction should be  (A) 174.5 K (B) 447.5 K (C) 600.5 K (D) 847.5 K;"To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the reaction rate constant (k) to the activation energy (Ea), temperature (T), and a constant (A):

k = A \* e^(-Ea/RT)

We are given that the reaction rate is to be tripled, so we can set up the following equation:

3k = k'

where k' is the new reaction rate constant.

We can rearrange the Arrhenius equation to solve for k:

k = A \* e^(-Ea/RT)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(k) = ln(A) - Ea/RT

Now, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:

ln(3k) = ln(k')

Subtracting ln(k) from both sides:

ln(3) = ln(k'/k)

Dividing both sides by ln(3):

k'/k = 3

Now, we can use the Arrhenius equation to find the new temperature (T') that corresponds to the new reaction rate constant (k'):

k' = A \* e^(-Ea/R \* T')

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(k') = ln(A) - Ea/R \* T'

Substituting the values given in the problem:

ln(3k) = ln(A) - 8.314 kJ/mol / (8.314 J/mol \* K) \* T'

Simplifying and solving for T':

T' = 447.5 K

The ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ for this reaction at 1173 K is  (A) 0.0 (B) 0.25 (C) 0.44 (D) 2.3;"To solve this problem, we can use the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:

FeO + CO = Fe + CO2

K = (pCO2 / pCO) / (pFe / pCO)

We are given the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) at 1173 K, which is 8120 J. We can use this value to calculate the equilibrium constant (K) using the following equation:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Rearranging the equation to solve for K, we get:

K = exp(-ΔG° / RT)

Plugging in the values, we get:

K = exp(-8120 J / (8.314 J/mol·K × 1173 K)) ≈ 0.44

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant expression to solve for the ratio of pCO / pCO2:

pCO2 / pCO = K × (pFe / pCO)

Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the ratio of pFe / pCO is equal to the ratio of the initial concentrations of FeO and CO. Let's assume the initial concentrations are 1 atm for both FeO and CO. Then, the ratio of pFe / pCO is 1.

Substituting this value into the equilibrium constant expression, we get:

pCO2 / pCO = K × (1) = 0.44

The value of $C_S$ at 1900 K is  (A) 0.0009 (B) 0.009 (C) 0.09 (D) 0.9;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fractions of the components in the slag and then plug them into the given equation.

First, let's calculate the total number of moles of oxygen in the slag:

55 wt.% CaO = 0.55 x (40 g/mol) / (40 g/mol + 28 g/mol + 27 g/mol + 16 g/mol) = 0.55 x 0.333 = 0.1835 mol
20 wt.% SiO2 = 0.20 x (28 g/mol) / (40 g/mol + 28 g/mol + 27 g/mol + 16 g/mol) = 0.20 x 0.333 = 0.0667 mol
15 wt.% Al2O3 = 0.15 x (2 x 27 g/mol) / (40 g/mol + 28 g/mol + 27 g/mol + 16 g/mol) = 0.15 x 0.333 = 0.0495 mol
10 wt.% MgO = 0.10 x (24 g/mol) / (40 g/mol + 28 g/mol + 27 g/mol + 16 g/mol) = 0.10 x 0.333 = 0.0333 mol

Total moles of oxygen = 0.1835 + 0.0667 + 0.0495 + 0.0333 = 0.333

Now, let's calculate the mole fractions:

X(CaO) = 0.1835 / 0.333 = 0.551
X(MgO) = 0.0333 / 0.333 = 0.100
X(Al2O3) = 0.0495 / 0.333 = 0.148
X(SiO2) = 0.0667 / 0.333 = 0.201

Now, we can plug these values into the given equation:

log Cs = 3.44 * (0.551 + 0.1*0.100 - 0.8*0.148 - 0.201) - (9894/1900) + 2.05

P. Oil quenching: Oil quenching is a slow cooling process, which means it is a relatively mild quenching method.

Q. Water quenching: Water quenching is a faster cooling process than oil quenching, but still relatively slow.

R. Water quenching with agitation: Adding agitation to water quenching increases the cooling rate, making it more severe than plain water quenching.

S. Brine quenching: Brine quenching is a highly aggressive quenching method, as the salt in the brine increases the cooling rate and can cause more rapid formation of martensite.

(A) This statement is correct. Higher cold work can introduce more defects and lattice distortions, which can reduce the recrystallization temperature.

(B) This statement is correct. A higher degree of recovery can facilitate the formation of new grains with a higher recrystallization temperature.

(C) This statement is incorrect. The temperature at which cold work occurs is not directly related to the recrystallization temperature. Cold work can be performed at various temperatures, but the effect on recrystallization temperature is due to the amount of defects and lattice distortions introduced, not the temperature at which the cold work is performed.

(D) This statement is correct. Finer initial grain sizes typically require higher recrystallization temperatures due to the increased boundary area and grain boundary energy.

Fracture stress for the same material having a crack length of 4 µm is  (A) 200 MPa (B) 150 MPa (C) 100 MPa (D) 50 MPa;"The question is related to the concept of fracture mechanics and the effect of crack length on the fracture stress of a brittle material.

The fracture stress of a brittle material is inversely proportional to the square root of the crack length. This is known as the Griffith theory.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

σ = σ0 / √(a)

where σ is the fracture stress, σ0 is the fracture stress of a material without a crack, and a is the crack length.

Given the values:

* Fracture stress for a material with a crack length of 1 µm = 200 MPa
* Fracture stress for the same material with a crack length of 4 µm =?

We can use the above equation to find the answer:

200 MPa = σ0 / √(1 µm)
σ0 = 200 MPa × √(1 µm) = 200 MPa × 1 = 200 MPa

Now, we can find the fracture stress for the material with a crack length of 4 µm:

σ = σ0 / √(4 µm) = 200 MPa / √(4 µm) = 200 MPa / 2 = 100 MPa

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The flow stress is given by the equation:

σ = 100 * (ε)^(0.1) MPa

where ε is the strain rate.

To find the strain rate, we need to find the strain (ε) first. The strain is given by:

ε = (ΔL / L0)

where ΔL is the change in length and L0 is the initial length.

In this case, the initial diameter is 10 cm and the final diameter is 5 cm, so the change in length is:

ΔL = L0 - Lf = π(10^2) - π(5^2) = 75π cm

The initial length is:

L0 = π(10^2) = 100π cm

So, the strain is:

ε = ΔL / L0 = 75π / 100π = 0.75

Now, we can find the strain rate (ε) by using the equation:

ε = ΔL / t

where t is the time taken for the deformation. In this case, the time taken is:

t = distance / speed = 5 cm / 2 cm/s = 2.5 s

So, the strain rate is:

ε = ΔL / t = 75π / 2.5 = 30π

Now, we can find the flow stress (σ) by substituting the value of ε into the equation:

σ = 100 * (30π)^(0.1) MPa

σ = 100 * 1.095 MPa

σ = 109.5 MPa

Assertion (a): During rolling, front tension and (or) back tension are (is) employed to decrease rolling load.

Reason (r): Roll pressure decreases due to lowering of flow stress as a result of front tension/back tension.

To determine the correctness of the pair, we can consider the following:

* Roll pressure decreases when the flow stress is lowered due to front tension and back tension (Reason r is also true).
* The reason given (r) is the actual cause for the effect mentioned in the assertion (a). In other words, the decrease in rolling load is indeed a result of the lowering of flow stress due to front tension and back tension (Reason r is the correct reason for Assertion a).

Mechanical Properties;66;G-META-12-48;MCQS-NUM;91;A steel ball (density $ρ_(steel)$ = 7200 kg/$m^(3)$) is placed in an upward moving liquid Al (density $ρ_(Al)$ = 2360 kg/$m^(3)$, viscosity $μ_(Al)$ = 1*$10^(–3)$ Pa.s and Reynolds number = 5*$10^(5)$). The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball. The force exerted on the steel ball is  (A) 8.32 N (B) 6.70 N (C) 1.67 N (D) 0.52 N;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the force exerted on the steel ball due to the upward moving liquid Al.

The force can be calculated using the drag equation:

F = f π R² (ρAl v² / 2)

where f is the friction factor, R is the radius of the steel ball, Al is the density of the liquid Al, and v is the velocity of the liquid Al.

Given values:

f = 0.2
ρAl = 2360 kg/m³
v =? (we need to find this)
R =? (we need to find this)

We are not given the velocity and radius of the steel ball, so we need to find them first.

The Reynolds number is given as 5*10^5, which is a measure of the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. For a Reynolds number of 5*10^5, the flow is likely to be turbulent.

The terminal velocity of the steel ball can be calculated using the following equation:

v = √(2g(ρsteel - Al)R / (3μAl))

where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²).

Substituting the given values, we get:

v = √(2*9.8*(7200-2360)*R / (3*0.001))

Simplifying and solving for R, we get:

R ≈ 0.025 m (or 25 mm)

Now we can calculate the velocity:

v = √(2*9.8*(7200-2360)*0.025 / (3*0.001)) ≈ 4.5 m/s

Now we can calculate the force:

F = 0.2 π (0.025)² (2360*4.5² / 2) ≈ 1.67 N

The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball. The terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle having diameter $d_p$, in µm range, if allowed to fall in a quiescent liquid Al bath, is  (A) 5.2*$10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (B) 2.6* $10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (C) 1.3*$10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (D) 6.6* $10^5$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s;"To solve this problem, we can start by rearranging the given force equation to solve for the terminal velocity (v):

F = f π R^(2) (ρ_(Al) v^2 /2)

Given: F = 0 (since the ball is in a quiescent liquid and not accelerating)
R = radius of the steel ball = d_p / 2 (where d_p is the diameter of the steel ball)
ρ_(Al) = 2360 kg/m^3
μ_(Al) = 0.001 Pa·s ( converted to N·s/m^2)

Reynolds number = 50,000 (given)
A spherical particle in a quiescent liquid will experience a constant drag force (F) due to the fluid resistance.
Since F = 0, the drag force F is zero,
the term on the right-hand side of the equation must also be zero.

Now, apply the drag equation:

F = f π R^2 (ρ_(Al) v^2 /2) = 0

Given values: f = 0.2, R = d_p / 2, ρ_(Al) = 2360 kg/m^3

Simplify the equation:

0 = 0.2 π (d_p / 2)^2 (2360) v^2 /2
v^2 = (0.2 π (d_p / 2)^2 (2360) /2) * v^2
v^2 = 6.6 * 10^5 * d_p^2
v = sqrt( 6.6 * 10^5 * d_p^2 ) ≈ 265.5 * d_p^2

Grain size of the material is approximately  (A) 45 µm (B) 35 µm (C) 4.5 µm (D) 3.5 µm;"To solve this problem, we can use the Hall-Petch relationship, which states that the lattice frictional stress (σ) is inversely proportional to the square root of the grain size (d):

σ = σ0 + kd^(-1/2)

Given the values:

σ0 = 100 MN/m^2
k = 0.10 MN/m^(1.5)

We can rearrange the equation to solve for d:

d = (k / (σ0 - σ))^2

Plugging in the values, we get:

d = (0.10 MN/m^(1.5) / (100 MN/m^2 - σ))^2

Since σ is not given, we can't find the exact value of d. However, we can find the approximate value of d by assuming σ is close to σ0.

Let's assume σ ≈ σ0 = 100 MN/m^2. Then:

d = (0.10 MN/m^(1.5) / (100 MN/m^2 - 100 MN/m^2))^2
= (0.10 MN/m^(1.5) / 0)^2
= 

This is not a valid result, as grain size cannot be infinite. Therefore, we need to find a more accurate value of σ.

Let's try σ ≈ 99.9 MN/m^2:

d = (0.10 MN/m^(1.5) / (100 MN/m^2 - 99.9 MN/m^2))^2

* The metal is at a high temperature (1700 K).
* It's poured into a sand mold that is open at the top, which means there is no solid surface to conduct heat away from the metal.
* Since the mold is open, there is no convection (natural circulation of air or fluid) to carry heat away from the metal.

Given these conditions, the primary mode of heat loss from the liquid metal is:

* Radiation: The hot metal will emit thermal radiation, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation, into the surrounding environment.

* Vacancies are a type of equilibrium defect, which refers to the presence of empty sites or holes in the crystal lattice.
* Dislocations (B) are a type of nonequilibrium defect, which occurs when there is a disruption in the regular arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice.
* Stacking faults (C) are a type of nonequilibrium defect, which occurs when there is a misalignment of atomic layers in the crystal lattice.

Here's a brief explanation of the options:

* (A) Nitriding: Nitriding is a surface treatment that can improve fatigue life by creating a hard, wear-resistant layer on the surface of the steel component.
* (B) Decarburization: Decarburization is a process that reduces the carbon content of the steel surface, which can weaken the material and reduce its fatigue life.
* (C) Improving surface finish: A smoother surface finish can improve fatigue life by reducing stress concentrations and minimizing the risk of fatigue cracks.
* (D) Shot-peening: Shot-peening is a process that creates a compressive stress layer on the surface of the steel component, which can improve fatigue life by preventing fatigue cracks from propagating.

Isothermal compressibility is defined as the change in volume of a material per unit change in pressure, at constant temperature.

Mathematically, it can be represented as:

* High temperature (P) favors the formation of sulphate from metal sulphide concentrates.
* High partial pressure of oxygen (Q) favors the formation of sulphate from metal sulphide concentrates.
* Use of excess air (R) also favors the formation of sulphate from metal sulphide concentrates.

The formation of sulphate from metal sulphide concentrates is an oxidation reaction, which requires oxygen and high temperatures. The use of excess air ensures that there is sufficient oxygen available for the reaction to occur. High partial pressure of SO3 (S) is not a necessary condition for the formation of sulphate from metal sulphide concentrates.

(B) suppresses the solution-loss reaction

Explanation:

In a blast furnace, the top pressure refers to the pressure at the top of the furnace, which is typically maintained at a certain level to control the flow of gases and solids. A high top pressure in a blast furnace operation:

* Suppresses the solution-loss reaction: Solution loss occurs when the iron ore dissolves in the slag, reducing the amount of iron available for reduction. A high top pressure helps to maintain a stable and dense slag layer, which reduces the likelihood of solution loss and increases the efficiency of the furnace.

The other options are incorrect:

* (A) A high top pressure does not favor the solution-loss reaction, but rather suppresses it.
* (C) The gas-solid contact time is not directly affected by the top pressure.

It is a complex mixture of various compounds, but it can be characterized as:

* Basic: The slag is alkaline in nature, with a pH value above 7. This is because it contains basic oxides such as calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO), which are derived from the fluxes used in the process.
* Reducing: Despite being basic, the slag is also reducing in nature, meaning it has a tendency to remove oxygen from the steel. This is because it contains reducing agents such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3), which can react with oxygen to form more basic compounds.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) oxidizing and basic

Note that the slag is not purely oxidizing, as it is not capable of oxidizing the steel further. Instead, it is a complex mixture that plays a crucial role in removing impurities and refining the steel.";C;C;1;

A) low contact angle with the base metal

Explanation:

* Low contact angle: A low contact angle between the molten filler alloy and the base metal is essential for good wetting and spreading of the filler metal. This allows the filler metal to flow easily and uniformly into the joint, ensuring a strong and consistent bond.
* Low density: This is not a critical factor in brazing.
* High surface tension: High surface tension can actually hinder the wetting and spreading of the filler metal, making it more difficult to achieve a good bond.
* High viscosity: High viscosity can make it difficult to flow the filler metal into the joint, making it more challenging to achieve a good bond.

Therefore, option A) low contact angle with the base metal is the correct answer.";A;A;1;

As the concentration of point defects in a crystal increases, the configurational entropy of the crystal also increases. This is because the defects introduce additional ways for the atoms to be arranged, which increases the number of possible configurations of the crystal.

Here's a brief explanation of the other options:

(A) does not change: This is incorrect because the configurational entropy of the crystal does change as the concentration of point defects increases.

(B) decreases: This is incorrect because the configurational entropy of the crystal increases as the concentration of point defects increases.

(D) initially increases and then decreases: This is incorrect because the configurational entropy of the crystal continues to increase as the concentration of point defects increases, it does not initially increase and then decrease.

Risers are not required for casting plain carbon steel because it has a relatively low shrinkage rate and can be cast without the need for risers to compensate for shrinkage. Risers are typically used in casting processes to provide a pathway for molten metal to flow back into the mold as it solidifies, helping to reduce porosity and improve the quality of the cast part.

For a diamond cubic structure, the APF can be calculated as follows:

APF = (Volume of atoms / Volume of unit cell)

The volume of a unit cell of a diamond cubic structure is:

V = a^3

where a is the lattice parameter.

The volume of an atom in the diamond cubic structure is:

V_atom = (4/3)πr^3

where r is the radius of the atom.

Substituting these values, we get:

APF = (4/3)πr^3 / a^3

For diamond, the lattice parameter a is approximately 3.57 Å, and the radius of a carbon atom is approximately 0.77 Å.

Plugging in these values, we get:

APF = (4/3)π(0.77 Å)^3 / (3.57 Å)^3 ≈ 0.340

We are given the stress-strain relationship as:

σ = 1050 * ε^(0.25)

We want to find the maximum value of ε that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can rearrange the equation to isolate ε:

ε^(0.25) = σ / 1050

Now, we can take the 4th root of both sides to get:

ε = (σ / 1050)^(4/4)

= (σ / 1050)

This is the maximum true uniform strain that can be imparted to the material.

So, the correct answer is:

The packing density of its (100) plane is  (A) 0.68 (B) 0.74 (C) 0.79 (D) 0.91;"To solve this problem, we need to find the packing density of the (100) plane of the element. The packing density is the ratio of the area of the atoms in the plane to the total area of the plane.

Since the unit cell has maximum linear density along the [110] direction, the atoms are packed most densely along this direction. This means that the atoms are arranged in a rectangular array with a basis of two atoms per unit cell.

The (100) plane of this array has a lattice parameter of a = √2a, where a is the lattice parameter of the unit cell. The area of this plane is therefore:

A = (a√2)^2 = 2a^2

The area of the atoms in the plane is the sum of the areas of the two atoms:

A_atoms = 2 \* (πr^2) = 2 \* (π \* (a/√2)^2) = πa^2

The packing density is therefore:

The condition for miscibility is:

For an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) metal, the XRD pattern shows a series of peaks corresponding to different Miller indices (h, k, l). The ratio of interplanar spacing obtained from the first two peaks is related to the lattice parameter (a) of the metal.

The first peak corresponds to the (111) plane, and the second peak corresponds to the (200) plane. The interplanar spacing (d) for these planes can be calculated using the following equations:

d111 = a / √8
d200 = a / √2

The ratio of these interplanar spacings is:

d111 / d200 = √8 / √2 = √8/√2 = √2

The yield strength of the metal increases from 100 MPa to 145 MPa as the grain size decreases from 64 µm to 25 µm. This means that the yield strength increases by 45 MPa (145 - 100) as the grain size decreases by 39 µm (64 - 25).

To find the yield strength when the grain size is 36 µm, we can use the same ratio of change:

(C) positive

The critical value of the Gibbs energy of nucleation at equilibrium temperature is positive. This is because the Gibbs energy of nucleation is related to the free energy change associated with the formation of a nucleus, and this energy change must be positive for nucleation to occur spontaneously.

Here's a brief explanation:

* The Gibbs energy of nucleation (ΔG) is the energy change associated with the formation of a nucleus from a supersaturated solution.
* At equilibrium temperature, the Gibbs energy of nucleation is equal to zero, meaning that the energy change is zero.
* However, the critical value of the Gibbs energy of nucleation is the minimum energy change required for nucleation to occur spontaneously. This value is positive, meaning that the energy change must be greater than zero for nucleation to occur.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) positive.";C;B;0;

The reaction is: Sn + 2H^(+) = Sn^(2+) + H2

We can write the reduction potential of the reaction as:

E = E° - (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)

where E is the reduction potential, E° is the standard reduction potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

First, we need to calculate the reaction quotient Q. We are given the concentration of Sn^(2+) as 10^(-2) M, and the pH is 5, which means the concentration of H^(+) is 10^(-5) M. We are also given the partial pressure of H2 as 1 atm.

The reaction quotient Q is:

Q = [Sn^(2+)] \* [H2]^1 / ([Sn] \* [H^(+)]^2)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Q = (10^(-2) M) \* (1 atm) / ((1 M) \* (10^(-5) M)^2)

Q = 10^7

Now we can calculate the reduction potential E:

E = -0.136 V - (RT/nF) \* ln(10^7)

E = -0.136 V - (8.314 J/mol·K \* 298 K / (2 \* 96,485 C/mol)) \* ln(10^7)

E = -0.136 V - 0.0295 V

E = -0.1655 V

1 mesh = 0.00127 mm (or 1.27 microns)

Ladle deoxidation of liquid steel is done at 1600°C by adding ferro-aluminium. By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?;"A nice question! Let's break it down step by step.

The problem is asking to calculate the time it takes for alumina particles to float to the surface of liquid steel, given certain conditions. We'll use Stokes' law to do so.

Stokes' law states that the terminal velocity (u) of a particle in a fluid (in this case, steel) is directly proportional to the square of the radius (r) of the particle and inversely proportional to the density (ρ) of the fluid and the viscosity (μ) of the fluid.

The equation is:

u ∝ (r^2) / (ρ \* μ)

We're given the density of steel (ρ = 7000 kg/m³), the density of alumina (ρ = 3650 kg/m³), and the viscosity of steel (μ = 6 × 10⁻³ kg/m·s).

We need to find the time (t) it takes for the alumina particles to reach the surface. Since we're assuming Stokes' law behavior, we can relate the terminal velocity to the rise time:

t ∝ u^(-1)

Now, let's plug in the values we have:

t ∝ (ρ \* μ) / (r^2)

Substituting the given values:

t ∝ (7000 kg/m³ \* 6 × 10⁻³ kg/m·s) / (50 × 10⁻6 m)^2

Simplifying:

t ≈ 1.35 s

So, the correct answer is:

[1.35 s]

Please note that this calculation is an approximation, as it relies on Stokes' law and assumes the particle size, fluid density, and viscosity are constant. In reality, the particle size distribution, fluid properties, and other factors can affect the actual rise time.";-;2626 TO 2632;0;

The integral enthalpy of mixing is given by:

ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn)

To find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we take the derivative of ΔH^(mix) with respect to χ_(Cu):

(ΔH^(mix)/χ_(Cu)) = (-19250 * χ_(Zn)) + (-19250 * χ_(Cu)) * (χ_(Zn)/χ_(Cu))

Since χ_(Cu) + χ_(Zn) = 1, we can write:

(χ_(Zn)/χ_(Cu)) = -1

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

(ΔH^(mix)/χ_(Cu)) = -19250 * χ_(Zn) - 19250 * χ_(Cu)

Simplifying, we get:

(ΔH^(mix)/χ_(Cu)) = -19250 * (χ_(Cu) + χ_(Zn))

Since χ_(Cu) + χ_(Zn) = 1, we can substitute 1 for χ_(Cu) + χ_(Zn) and get:

where χ is the interaction parameter, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Given the equation:

ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn)

We can rearrange it to solve for χ:

χ = -ΔH^(mix) / (19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn))

Since χ is a measure of the interaction between the two components, it is a dimensionless quantity that ranges from 0 to 1. In this case, χ_(Cu) and χ_(Zn) are the mole fractions of copper and zinc, respectively.

To find the solution parameter, we need to find the value of χ that satisfies the equation. Since χ is a dimensionless quantity, we can set χ = 1, which means that the interaction between the two components is ideal.

Substituting χ = 1 into the equation, we get:

1 = -ΔH^(mix) / (19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn)

Let's assume the distance between the two parallel planes is d. Then, the length of the dislocation is L = d.

Now, we can plug in the values and calculate the energy:

Here's why:

Engineering stress is the ratio of the applied load to the original cross-sectional area of the material, while true stress is the ratio of the applied load to the current cross-sectional area of the material.

As a material is deformed, its cross-sectional area decreases, which means that the engineering stress increases more rapidly than the true stress. This is because the engineering stress is calculated using the original area, while the true stress is calculated using the current area.

As a result, the true stress-true strain curve lies below and to the right of the engineering stress-engineering strain curve. This means that the true stress is lower than the engineering stress at the same strain, and the true strain is greater than the engineering strain at the same stress.

Let's break it down:

* Both components are identical, meaning they have the same geometry and dimensions.
* They are subjected to the same stress during operation under Mode I loading (tensile or opening mode).
* The only difference is the material properties: alloy X has a higher $K_{IC}$ (fracture toughness) than alloy Y.

From the fracture mechanics perspective, the critical flaw size that can lead to crack propagation is inversely proportional to the square root of the fracture toughness ($K_{IC}$). This is known as the ""critical flaw size"" or ""threshold flaw size"".

Since alloy X has a higher $K_{IC}$ than alloy Y, it means that alloy X can tolerate a larger critical flaw size before crack propagation occurs. This is because a larger flaw size is required to reduce the stress intensity factor to the point where crack propagation becomes possible.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The driving force for grain growth is the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material. (C) Higher the temperature, the faster is the grain growth. (D) Impurity atoms segregated at grain boundaries can retard grain growth;"Here's the solution:

Grain growth, also known as grain coarsening, is the process by which the average grain size of a material increases over time. The driving force for grain growth is the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material, which occurs as the grains grow and the total grain boundary area decreases.

The correct statements are:

* (A) As the average grain size increases, the grain boundary energy per unit area decreases. This is because the total grain boundary area decreases as the grains grow, leading to a decrease in the total grain boundary energy.
* (D) Impurity atoms segregated at grain boundaries can retard grain growth. This is because impurities can increase the grain boundary energy, making it more difficult for the grains to grow.

The incorrect statement is:

* (B) The driving force for grain growth is the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material. This is incorrect because the driving force for grain growth is actually the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit area, not per unit volume.

(D) Single crystal

Single-crystal superalloys have the highest creep resistance due to their unique microstructure, which is characterized by:

* No grain boundaries, which are common sites for creep damage
* Higher density and fewer defects, which reduce the likelihood of creep cavitation
* Improved lattice stability, which enhances the alloy's resistance to plastic deformation
* Optimized solute distribution, which enhances the alloy's strength and ductility

In contrast, the other options have microstructures that are more prone to creep damage:

* Fine-grained equiaxed microstructures have a higher density of grain boundaries, which can act as sites for creep damage.
* Coarse-grained equiaxed microstructures have a lower density of grain boundaries, but may still exhibit creep damage due to the presence of defects and impurities.
* Columnar microstructures have a high density of grain boundaries and defects, which can lead to significant creep damage.

If the height of the green sample was 12 mm, then the fill height of powder (in mm) would have been?;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the metal powder used. We can do this by dividing the mass of the metal powder by its density.

Let's call the mass of the metal powder ""m"" and the fill height of the powder ""h"". Then, the volume of the metal powder can be calculated as:

Volume = m / (density * h)

Given the apparent density and the green density, we know that the density of the metal powder is 2.5 g/cm³. We are also given the green density, which is 5.5 g/cm³. This means that the metal powder has a density of 2.5 g/cm³ in its original form, and a density of 5.5 g/cm³ after compaction. The height of the green sample is 12 mm, which is equal to 1.2 cm.

Now, we can calculate the mass of the metal powder:

m = volume * density
= (height * π * radius^2) * density
= (1.2 cm * π * (radius)^2) * 2.5 g/cm^3
= approximately 4.71 grams

Now, we can calculate the volume of the metal powder:

Volume = mass / density
= 4.71 grams / 2.5 g/cm^3
= approximately 1.884 cm^3

To find the fill height of the powder, we need to divide the volume by the cross-sectional area of the die. The cross-sectional area of the die is equal to the diameter of the die squared, divided by 4:

Cross-sectional area = π * (radius)^2 / 4
= π * (radius)^2 / 4
= approximately 1.875 cm^2

Now, we can calculate the fill height of the powder:

Fill height = volume / cross-sectional area
= 1.884 cm^3 / 1.875 cm^2
= approximately 1.0 cm
= 10 mm

Therefore, the fill height of the powder is approximately 10 mm.

The true strain is given as 0.405, which is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the original length:

ε = ln(Lf/L0) = 0.405

where Lf is the final length and L0 is the original length.

The gauge length is the original length, which is 5 mm. Let's call this L0.

The final gauge length is Lf, which is the length after deformation.

The true strain is given as 0.405, so we can write:

ln(Lf/5) = 0.405

To solve for Lf, we can take the exponential of both sides:

Lf = 5 × e^0.405

Lf ≈ 5 × 1.495

Lf ≈ 7.475 mm

What is the activity of Q in an alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6 at the same temperature?;"To solve this problem, we need to use the given equation to find the activity coefficient of Q (γQ) and then use the definition of activity to find the activity of Q.

The given equation is:

ln γQ = 0.6*(xR)^2 - 0.2*(xR)^3

We are given that xR = 0.6, so we can plug this value into the equation:

ln γQ = 0.6*(0.6)^2 - 0.2*(0.6)^3
= 0.6*0.36 - 0.2*0.216
= 0.216 - 0.0432

Now, we can use the definition of activity to find the activity of Q:

aQ = γQ * xQ

We are given that xR = 0.6, which means xQ = 1 - xR = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. Therefore:

aQ = γQ * xQ
= e^(0.1728) * 0.4

(C) the same weight fractions of the liquid and the solid. (D) different compositions and weight fractions of the liquid;"Let's analyze the situation:

Both alloys are Cu-Ni alloys with different Ni concentrations: 47 wt.% Ni and 53 wt.% Ni.

They are kept in separate crucibles and allowed to equilibrate at the same temperature T1 between the liquidus and the solidus. This means that both alloys are partially melted, with some liquid and some solid present.

Since the alloys are at the same temperature, the solidus and liquidus temperatures are the same for both alloys. This is important because it means that the same phase transformations are occurring in both alloys.

Now, let's consider the composition of the liquid and solid phases in each alloy:

Alloy 1 (47 wt.% Ni):
- The solid phase is a Cu-rich solid solution (α phase).
- The liquid phase is a Cu-Ni liquid solution with a lower Ni concentration than the original alloy.

Alloy 2 (53 wt.% Ni):
- The solid phase is a Cu-Ni solid solution (γ phase) with a higher Ni concentration than the original alloy.
- The liquid phase is a Cu-Ni liquid solution with a higher Ni concentration than the original alloy.

Since the solidus and liquidus temperatures are the same for both alloys, the weight fractions of the liquid and solid phases are the same for both alloys. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations are:

To find the plane on which these partial dislocations lie, we need to find the normal vector to the plane.

The normal vector to the plane is the cross product of the two Burgers vectors:

Normal vector = [(a/6)[2 -1 1] x (a/6)[1 -2 -1]]

Expanding the cross product, we get:

Assume that air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen.;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of oxygen required for the complete combustion of 100 m³ of methane (CH) at STP.

The combustion reaction of methane is:

CH + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O

From the reaction, we can see that 1 mole of methane requires 2 moles of oxygen for complete combustion.

The molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol. Therefore, the volume of 1 mole of gas at STP is:

22.4 L/mol

The volume of 100 m³ of methane at STP is:

100 m³ = 100,000 L

Since the volume of 1 mole of gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol, we can calculate the number of moles of methane:

100,000 L / 22.4 L/mol = 4.46 mol

Since 1 mole of methane requires 2 moles of oxygen, the total amount of oxygen required is:

4.46 mol CH × 2 mol O₂/mol CH = 8.92 mol O₂

The volume of oxygen required at STP is:

8.92 mol O₂ × 22.4 L/mol = 199.5 L

Since air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen, the volume of air required is:

199.5 L / 0.21 = 951.4 L

To convert this volume to cubic meters, we can divide by 1000 (since there are 1000 L in 1 m³):

951.4 L / 1000 = 0.9514 m³

However, this is the volume of air required, not the volume of oxygen. Since air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen, the volume of oxygen in the air is:

0.9514 m³ × 0.21 = 0.2001 m³

So, the theoretical requirement of air (in m³ at STP) for the complete combustion of 100 m³ (at STP) of a fuel consisting of pure CH is:

Faraday constant is 96500 C/mol and the universal gas constant is 8.314 J/(mol.K).;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cell potential (E) using the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)

where E° is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

Given:

* a(Cu) = 0.8 (activity of copper at the anode)
* Pure copper as the cathode (activity of copper = 1)
* Copper is divalent (n = 2)
* T = 25°C = 298 K
* F = 96500 C/mol
* R = 8.314 J/(mol.K)

First, we need to calculate the reaction quotient (Q):

Q = (a(Cu) / 1)^(2) = (0.8 / 1)^(2) = 0.64

Now, we can calculate the cell potential:

E = E° - (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)
= E° - (8.314 J/(mol.K) \* 298 K / (2 \* 96500 C/mol)) \* ln(0.64)

= E° - 0.0161 V

The standard cell potential (E°) is not given in the problem, but we can assume it to be a reasonable value, say 0.3 V. Then:

The maximum shear stress (τ) can be calculated using the following formula:

τ = (σ1 - σ3) / 2

where σ1 is the maximum principal stress, σ3 is the minimum principal stress, and σ is the intermediate principal stress.

In this case, the principal stresses are 250 MPa, 50 MPa, and -50 MPa. The maximum principal stress (σ1) is 250 MPa, the minimum principal stress (σ3) is -50 MPa, and the intermediate principal stress (σ2) is 50 MPa.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

τ = (250 - (-50)) / 2 = 150 MPa

Reason (r): Decreased partial pressure of CO(g) promotes deoxidation and decarburization.

The correct answer is:

Here's why:

* Deoxidation and decarburization of liquid steel are indeed done by vacuum treatment process, which involves removing oxygen and carbon from the steel by reducing the partial pressure of CO(g) and other gases. This process is known as vacuum degassing.
* The reason for this is that decreasing the partial pressure of CO(g) promotes deoxidation and decarburization, as stated in reason (r). By reducing the partial pressure of CO(g), the reaction equilibrium shifts towards the removal of oxygen and carbon from the steel, making it possible to deoxidize and decarburize the steel more effectively.

where σ is the stress (0.4 GPa) and E is the Young's modulus (200 GPa).

ε = 0.4 GPa / 200 GPa = 0.002

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Atomic Structure;60;G-META-14-48;NUM;19;The atomic radius of aluminium is 1.431 Å. The interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium, in Å, is?;"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of atomic radius and the spacing of planes in a crystal lattice.

The atomic radius of aluminum is given as 1.431 Å.

The (111) plane in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, such as aluminum, has a spacing that can be calculated using the following formula:

d = a / √3

where d is the spacing, a is the lattice parameter, and √3 is the square root of 3.

The lattice parameter (a) can be related to the atomic radius (r) using the following formula:

a = 4r√2

Substituting the value of atomic radius (r = 1.431 Å) into this equation, we get:

a = 4(1.431)√2
= 6.964 Å

Now, we can calculate the spacing (d) using the first formula:

d = 6.964 Å / √3
= 3.944 Å

Therefore, the correct answer is:

If a rod of this metal is subjected to a true strain of ε = 0.3 by extrusion, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (in MJ/$m^3$) is;"To solve this problem, we need to find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W) by integrating the flow curve from ε = 0 to ε = 0.3.

The flow curve is given as σ = 200ε^(0.25), where σ is the stress in MPa and ε is the true strain.

We can rewrite the flow curve as:

σ = 200ε^(0.25) = 200(ε^(1/4))

Now, we can integrate the flow curve to find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W):

W = σ dε = 200ε^(1/4) dε

To evaluate this integral, we can use the power rule of integration, which states that:

x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C

In this case, n = 1/4, so:

W = 200ε^(1/4) dε = 200ε^(1/4) dε

= 200(ε^(3/4))/((3/4) + 1) + C

= 200(ε^(3/4))/(1.25) + C

Now, we need to evaluate the constant of integration (C). Since the flow curve is given for ε = 0 to ε = 0.3, we can set up the following equation:

200(0)^(3/4)/(1.25) + C = 0

C = 0

So, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W) is:

W = 200(ε^(3/4))/(1.25)

To find the value of W for ε = 0.3, we can plug in the value of ε:

W = 200(0.3^(3/4))/(1.25)

= 200(0.3^(0.75))/1.25

= 200(0.2161)/1.25

= 54.24 MJ/m^3

The condition for equilibrium is that the chemical potential of each component must be equal in both phases. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

μ_i^α = μ_i^β

where μ_i^α is the chemical potential of component i in phase α, and μ_i^β is the chemical potential of component i in phase β.

In this problem, we are given that x and y are the only components present in phases α and β. Therefore, we can write the condition for equilibrium as:

μ_x^α = μ_x^β
μ_y^α = μ_y^β

Now, let's examine the options:

A) (μ_x)^α = (μ_y)^β and (μ_x)^β = (μ_y)^α

This option is incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition for equilibrium. The chemical potential of x should be equal in both phases, not the chemical potential of y.

B) (μ_β)^x = (μ_α)^y and (μ_α)^x = (μ_β)^y

This option is also incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition for equilibrium. The chemical potential of x and y should be equal in both phases, not the chemical potential of β and α.

C) (μ_x)^α = (μ_x)^β and (μ_y)^β = (μ_y)^α

This option is incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition for equilibrium. The chemical potential of y should be equal in both phases, not just the chemical potential of x.

D) (μ_x)^α = (μ_y)^α and (μ_x)^β = (μ_y)^β

This option is correct because it satisfies the condition for equilibrium. The chemical potential of x is equal in both phases, and the chemical potential of y is also equal in both phases.

* Lower basicity: Basicity refers to the ratio of calcium oxide (CaO) to silicon dioxide (SiO2) in the slag. A lower basicity means that there is less calcium oxide present, which can help to reduce the amount of silicon that is removed from the iron as a slag.

What is the change in the enthalpy of pure iron (in J/mol) when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C?;"To solve this problem, we need to find the change in enthalpy (ΔH) of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C.

First, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT) in Kelvin:

ΔT = 700 K - 298 K = 402 K

Next, we need to find the change in enthalpy (ΔH) using the specific heat capacity (Cp) of pure iron:

ΔH = [Cp dT] = [17.49 + 24.77 × 10^(-3)T] dT

To evaluate this integral, we can break it down into two parts:

ΔH = [17.49 dT] + [24.77 × 10^(-3)T dT]

The first integral is easy to evaluate:

[17.49 dT] = 17.49T + C

where C is the constant of integration. Since the initial temperature is 25°C, the initial value of T is 298 K. Therefore, the constant C is:

C = -17.49 × 298 = -5205.22 J/mol

So, the first integral evaluates to:

17.49T - 5205.22

The second integral is a bit more challenging:

[24.77 × 10^(-3)T dT] = (24.77 × 10^(-3)) × (1/2)T^2 + C

Evaluating this integral at the initial and final temperatures, we get:

(24.77 × 10^(-3)) × (1/2)(298^2 - 700^2) = 144.51 J/mol

Now, we can combine the two results to find the total change in enthalpy:

ΔH = (17.49T - 5205.22) |^(700) - (17.49T - 5205.22) |^(298) + 144.51
= (17.49 × 700 - 5205.22) - (17.49 × 298 - 5205.22) + 144.51
= 12143.49 J/mol - 8449.42 J/mol + 144.51 J/mol
= 3738.58 J/mol

Therefore, the change in enthalpy of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C is approximately 3738.58 J/mol.

The densities of glass fibre and epoxy are $2.58 g/cm^3$ and 1.14 $g/cm^3$, respectively.;"To solve this problem, we can use the rule of mixtures to estimate the elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction. The rule of mixtures states that the elastic modulus of a composite is the sum of the elastic moduli of the individual components weighted by their respective volumes.

Let's denote the volume fraction of the glass fibre as Vf and the volume fraction of the epoxy matrix as Vm. We are given that the weight fraction of the glass fibre is 60%, which means that the volume fraction of the glass fibre is:

Vf = (mass of glass fibre / total mass) / (density of glass fibre)

Vf = (0.6 / (2.58 / 1.14)) = 0.73

The volume fraction of the epoxy matrix is:

Vm = 1 - Vf = 0.27

The elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction (Ef) is the sum of the elastic moduli of the glass fibre and the epoxy matrix weighted by their respective volume fractions:

Ef = Vf \* E_glass + Vm \* E_epoxy
= 0.73 \* 72.5 GPa + 0.27 \* 2.4 GPa
= 53.1 GPa + 0.648 GPa
= 53.748 GPa

In the same alloy, if the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm, the stress required (in MPa) is?;"To solve this problem, we can use the Orowan equation, which relates the stress required for dislocation bypass to the interprecipitate spacing:

σ = (Gb/2πr) \* ln(R/r)

where σ is the stress required for dislocation bypass, G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector, R is the radius of the precipitate, and r is the interprecipitate spacing.

We are given that the stress required for dislocation bypass is 200 MPa when the interprecipitate spacing is 500 nm. We can rearrange the Orowan equation to solve for G:

G = (2πr \* σ) / (b \* ln(R/r))

Substituting the given values, we get:

G = (2π \* 500e-9 \* 200e6) / (b \* ln(R/500e-9))
= 3.14e11 Pa

Now, we can use this value of G to find the stress required for dislocation bypass when the interprecipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm:

σ = (3.14e11 Pa \* 2π \* 200e-9) / (b \* ln(R/200e-9))

(B) increasing the cross-link density.

Explanation:

Creep resistance in polymers refers to their ability to resist deformation over time under constant stress. In epoxies, creep resistance can be enhanced by increasing the cross-link density. Cross-links are chemical bonds that connect polymer chains together, making the material more rigid and resistant to deformation. Increasing the cross-link density can improve the creep resistance of epoxies by reducing their ability to flow and deform over time.

The other options are not correct:

(A) Increasing the bulkiness of side groups may actually decrease the creep resistance of epoxies, as it can make the material more flexible and prone to deformation.

(C) Adding plasticizers to epoxies can actually decrease their creep resistance, as plasticizers are designed to reduce the material's stiffness and increase its flexibility.

(D) Annealing, which involves heating a material to relieve internal stresses, may not have a significant impact on the creep resistance of epoxies.

(B) Decreasing temperature and increasing pressure. (C) Decreasing both temperature and pressure. (D) Increasing temperature and decreasing pressure.;"To determine the conditions that favor the forward reaction, we need to analyze the reaction:

The reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat. The enthalpy change (ΔH°) is positive, which indicates that energy is required to drive the reaction forward.

To favor the forward reaction, we want to increase the reaction rate, which means we want to increase the concentration of products (CO) and decrease the concentration of reactants (C and CO2).

Considering the reaction conditions:

* Increasing temperature (A) and pressure (D) will favor the forward reaction, as the increased temperature will provide the necessary energy to drive the reaction forward, and the increased pressure will favor the formation of more CO molecules.
* Decreasing temperature (B) and pressure (C) will favor the reverse reaction, as the decreased temperature will reduce the reaction rate, and the decreased pressure will favor the decomposition of CO molecules.

The equilibrium ratio, $𝑝_(C0_2)$/ $𝑝_(CO)$ for the reaction at 1200 K and 1 atm is ?;"To solve this problem, we can use the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:

K = (pCO2 / pCO)

We are given the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) at 1200 K, which allows us to calculate the equilibrium constant using the following equation:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Rearranging the equation to solve for K, we get:

K = exp(-ΔG° / RT)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

K = exp(-(-8000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K × 1200 K)) = exp(6.43)

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant expression to solve for the equilibrium ratio:

(pCO2 / pCO) = K

(pCO2 / pCO) = exp(6.43) ≈ 543

The iron ore charged into the furnace contains 95% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ and the rest is gangue. Assume that all the iron in the ore goes to hot metal. The amount of iron ore (in kg) required for producing 1000 kg of hot metal is ?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The hot metal contains 95% Fe, which means it contains 0.95 x 1000 kg = 950 kg of Fe.
2. The iron ore contains 95% Fe2O3, which means it contains 0.95 x (160 g/mol) = 152 g/mol of Fe.
3. To produce 950 kg of Fe, we need to calculate the amount of Fe2O3 required. Since 1 mol of Fe2O3 contains 2 mol of Fe, we need:

950 kg Fe / (2 x 56 g/mol) = 8.5 mol Fe2O3

4. Now, we need to calculate the amount of iron ore required. Since the iron ore contains 152 g/mol of Fe2O3, we need:

8.5 mol Fe2O3 x (160 g/mol) / 152 g/mol = 11.2 kg of iron ore

In electrolytic refining of Ni, the anode is Cu-10 atom % Ni and the cathode is pure Ni. Assuming the Cu-Ni solution to be ideal, the ABSOLUTE value of the minimum voltage (in mV) required for refining is?;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum voltage required to drive the electrolysis reaction. The reaction at the anode is:

Cu-Ni → Cu² + Ni² + 2e

The reaction at the cathode is:

Ni² + 2e → Ni

The cell potential (E) can be calculated using the Nernst equation:

E = E° + (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)

where E° is the standard potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

First, we need to calculate the standard potential (E°) for the reaction. The standard potential for the Cu²/Cu half-cell is 0.34 V, and the standard potential for the Ni²/Ni half-cell is -0.25 V. Therefore, the standard potential for the overall reaction is:

E° = 0.34 V - 0.25 V = 0.09 V

Next, we need to calculate the reaction quotient (Q). The Cu-Ni solution is assumed to be ideal, so we can use the activity coefficients to calculate the activity of Cu² and Ni². The activity coefficient for Cu² is approximately 0.5, and the activity coefficient for Ni² is approximately 0.8. Therefore, the reaction quotient is:

Q = (aCu²)¹ \* (aNi²) = (0.5 \* 0.1)¹ \* (0.8 \* 0.1) = 0.16

Now we can calculate the cell potential:

E = 0.09 V + (8.314 J/mol·K \* 300 K / 2 \* 96490 C/mol) \* ln(0.16) = 0.09 V + 0.0035 V = 0.0935 V

Finally, we need to convert the cell potential to millivolts:

E = 0.0935 V \* 1000 = 93.5 mV

Therefore, the absolute value of the minimum voltage required for refining is:

$S_(mix) = -R*( $X_(A)*ln[X_(A)]$ +   $X_(B)ln[X_(B)]$)

To do this, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to $X_A$ and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{d(S_(mix))}{dX_A} = -R*(ln[X_(A)] + 1 - ln[X_(B)]) = 0$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$ln[X_(A)] = ln[X_(B)]$

$X_(A) = X_(B)$

This means that the configurational entropy due to ideal mixing is maximum when the mole fractions of A and B are equal, i.e., when $X_A = 0.5$.

On the other hand, if the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, the free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for solidification is ?;"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given that the melting point of the metal is 1356 K, and the free energy change for solidification (ΔG^(L→S)) when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1256 K is -1000 J/mol.

We can write the free energy change for solidification as:

ΔG^(L→S) = ΔH^(L→S) - TΔS^(L→S)

where ΔH^(L→S) is the enthalpy change for solidification, T is the temperature, and ΔS^(L→S) is the entropy change for solidification.

Since the metal is undercooled to 1256 K, the temperature is below the melting point. Therefore, the free energy change for solidification is negative, indicating that solidification is spontaneous.

We can rearrange the equation to solve for ΔH^(L→S):

ΔH^(L→S) = ΔG^(L→S) + TΔS^(L→S)

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔH^(L→S) = -1000 J/mol + (1256 K) × ΔS^(L→S)

Now, we need to find the free energy change for solidification when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K. We can use the same equation:

ΔG^(L→S) = ΔH^(L→S) - TΔS^(L→S)

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔG^(L→S) = ΔH^(L→S) - (1200 K) × ΔS^(L→S)

We can substitute the expression for ΔH^(L→S) that we derived earlier:

ΔG^(L→S) = (-1000 J/mol + (1256 K) × ΔS^(L→S)) - (1200 K) × ΔS^(L→S)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

ΔG^(L→S) = -1000 J/mol - 56 K × ΔS^(L→S)

Therefore, the free energy change for solidification when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K is -1000 J/mol - 56 K × ΔS^(L→S).

The time required (in hours) to achieve the same extent of homogenization at 1373 K is?;"Since we are given the diffusivities at both temperatures, we can use Fick's law of diffusion to relate the diffusion coefficient to the time required for homogenization.

The percent homogenization for a given time t is given by:

Percent Homogenization = (1 - 2 * ( tot / t ) )

where tot is the original inhomogeneous structure and t is the time required for homogenization.

At 1273 K, the time required for homogenization is 10 hours. We can calculate the total inhomogeneous structure (tot) by rearranging the above equation:

tot = (1 - (Percent Homogenization)) * t

Now, since the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the square root of the time required for homogenization, we can write:

D(1373 K) * √t(1373 K) = D(1273 K) * √10

Rearranging to solve for t(1373 K), we get:

t(1373 K) = (D(1273 K) / D(1373 K))^2 * 100

Now we can plug in the given values:

t(1373 K) = ((10^(-19) / 10^(-18))^2 * 100

t(1373 K) = 25 hours

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same extent of homogenization at 1373 K is approximately 25 hours.

The volume of the cylindrical billet is:

Volume = π × (Diameter/2)^2 × Height
= π × (0.5/2)^2 × 1.0
= 0.785 m^3

The volume of the pancake is:

Volume = π × (Diameter/2)^2 × Height
= π × (Diameter/2)^2 × 0.25

Since the volume remains the same during the upsetting process, we can set up the equation:

0.785 = π × (Diameter/2)^2 × 0.25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.785 = 0.25π × (Diameter/2)^2

Dividing both sides by 0.25π, we get:

Let's analyze the assertion and reason:

**Assertion**: In a pure metal weld, elastic modulus in the heat affected zone (HAZ) is the same as that in the base metal.

**Reason**: Coarse grained microstructure in the HAZ results in lower hardness.

The answer can be inferred by analyzing the properties of HAZ and the effect of microstructure on properties.

* **Heat Affected Zone (HAZ)**: The HAZ is the region near the weld zone where the metal has been heated, but not melted, during the welding process. The microstructure of the HAZ is often characterized by a mix of the original base metal grain structure and new grains formed as the metal cools and solidifies.
* **Elastic Modulus**: The elastic modulus of a material is a measure of its stiffness, which is dependent on the microstructure and crystal structure of the material.
* **Grain Size and Microstructure**: The grain size and microstructure of the material can affect its properties, including its hardness and stiffness.

Based on these principles, we can assess the assertion and reason:

**Both Correct**: The HAZ in a pure metal weld can have a similar elastic modulus to the base metal, as the HAZ microstructure can be relatively uniform and fine-grained, similar to the base metal.

**Reason Correct**: A coarse-grained microstructure in the HAZ would indeed result in lower hardness.

At the mould exit of a continuous caster, the metal consisting of a solidified shell with a liquid metal core exits at the rate of 35 kg $s^(-1)$. Given that the latent heat of fusion is 3 × $10^(5) J $kg^(-1)$ and the total rate of heat removal by the mould is 4.2 × $10^6$ W, the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total rate of heat removal by the mould is 4.2 × 10^6 W. Since the metal is at the melting point, the heat removed is used to melt the solidified shell.
2. The latent heat of fusion is 3 × 10^5 J/kg. This means that it takes 3 × 10^5 J of energy to melt 1 kg of metal.
3. The rate at which the metal exits the mould is 35 kg/s. This means that the rate at which heat is removed is also 35 kg/s × 3 × 10^5 J/kg = 1.05 × 10^6 W.
4. Since the actual rate of heat removal is 4.2 × 10^6 W, the remaining heat removed is 4.2 × 10^6 W - 1.05 × 10^6 W = 2.15 × 10^6 W.
5. This remaining heat is used to melt the solidified shell. Since the shell is at the melting point, the temperature of the shell is the melting point. Therefore, the heat removed from the shell is used to melt the shell.
6. The mass of the shell that is melted per second is the rate at which heat is removed from the shell divided by the latent heat of fusion: 2.15 × 10^6 W / (3 × 10^5 J/kg) = 0.717 kg/s.
7. The mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is the mass of solid divided by the total mass exiting the mould. The mass of solid is the mass of the shell that is not melted, which is 35 kg/s - 0.717 kg/s = 34.283 kg/s. The mass fraction of solid is therefore:

Mechanical Properties;39;G-META-15-49;NUM;39;The driving force for sintering a compact consisting of spherical particles of radius $R_1$ is $∆G_1$. If the particle size is reduced to $R_2$ = 0.1 $R_1$, the corresponding driving force $∆G_2$ = α $∆G_1$ , where α is;"A question about sintering!

The driving force for sintering is related to the surface energy of the particles. When the particle size is reduced, the surface area increases, and the driving force for sintering also increases.

Let's analyze the situation:

Initially, the particle size is $R_1$, and the driving force for sintering is $\Delta G_1$.

When the particle size is reduced to $R_2 = 0.1 R_1$, the surface area increases by a factor of $1/(0.1)^2 = 100$. Since the surface energy is proportional to the surface area, the driving force for sintering increases by a factor of 100.

So, we can write:

$$\Delta G_2 = \alpha \Delta G_1$$

where $\alpha$ is the factor by which the driving force increases.

Since the driving force increases by a factor of 100, we can set:

$$\alpha = 100$$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

* $\alpha = 100$

Note that this is a rough estimate, as the exact relationship between particle size and driving force for sintering can be complex and depends on various factors, such as the material properties and the sintering conditions.";-;10;0;

The slope of this line is positive because  (A) ∆S° is positive (B) ∆S° is negative (C) ∆H° is positive (D) ∆H° is negative;"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the slope of the Ellingham diagram and the thermodynamic properties of the reaction.

The Ellingham diagram plots the standard free energy change (ΔG°) of the reaction as a function of temperature. The slope of this line is related to the enthalpy change (ΔH°) and entropy change (ΔS°) of the reaction.

The slope of the Ellingham diagram is given by:

d(ΔG°)/dT = ΔS°

where d(ΔG°)/dT is the slope of the line, and ΔS° is the standard entropy change of the reaction.

Since the slope is positive, it means that ΔS° is also positive. This is because a positive slope indicates that the free energy change increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with a positive entropy change.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Find x;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the strain energy per unit length of a dislocation with a Burgers vector of (a/2)[110] and compare it to the strain energy per unit length of a dislocation with a Burgers vector of a/6[112].

The strain energy per unit length of a dislocation is given by the following equation:

U = Gb^2 / (2π)

where G is the shear modulus, b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and π is a constant.

For the (a/2)[110] dislocation, the magnitude of the Burgers vector is:

b = |a/2| = a/2

For the a/6[112] dislocation, the magnitude of the Burgers vector is:

b = |a/6| = a/6

The shear modulus G is the same for both dislocations, so we can simplify the equation to:

U = Gb^2 / (2π)

Substituting the values of b for each dislocation, we get:

U_(a/2[110]) = G(a/2)^2 / (2π)
U_(a/6[112]) = G(a/6)^2 / (2π)

Now, we can set up a ratio of the two strain energies:

U_(a/2[110]) / U_(a/6[112]) = (G(a/2)^2 / (2π)) / (G(a/6)^2 / (2π))

Simplifying the ratio, we get:

U_(a/2[110]) / U_(a/6[112]) = (a/2)^2 / (a/6)^2

Simplifying further, we get:

U_(a/2[110]) / U_(a/6[112]) = 4

So, the strain energy per unit length of a dislocation with a Burgers vector of (a/2)[110] is 4 times that of a dislocation with a Burgers vector of a/6[112].

The fracture strength (in MPa) in medium Q based on Griffith's theory is?;"To solve this problem, we can use Griffith's theory of brittle fracture, which states that the fracture strength of a material is inversely proportional to the square root of the surface energy.

The fracture strength (σ) is given by:

σ = √(2γE/πa)

where γ is the surface energy, E is the Young's modulus, and a is the flaw size.

We are given that the fracture strength in medium P is 300 MPa, and the surface energy is 0.9 J/m². We can rearrange the equation to solve for E:

E = πa(σ²)/(2γ)

Substituting the values, we get:

E = πa(300²)/(2 × 0.9)

Now, we are asked to find the fracture strength in medium Q, where the surface energy is 0.1 J/m². We can use the same equation, but with the new surface energy:

σ = √(2 × 0.1 × E/πa)

Substituting the value of E from the previous step, we get:

(C) Silica has a significantly lower melting point than magnesia. (D) Silica is significantly more acidic than magnesia.;"The correct answer is:

A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures.

Explanation:

Silica bricks (made from silicon dioxide) and magnesia bricks (made from magnesium oxide) are both used in furnace roofs, but they have different thermal expansion properties. Silica bricks have a lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia bricks, which means that they expand less when heated. This is important for self-supporting arches, as they need to maintain their shape and structure under high temperatures.

Magnesia bricks, on the other hand, have a higher thermal expansion coefficient, which means they expand more when heated. This can cause them to lose their shape and structure, making them less suitable for self-supporting arches.

Therefore, silica bricks are preferred for fabricating self-supporting arches for furnace roofs because of their lower thermal expansion coefficient, which allows them to maintain their shape and structure under high temperatures.";A;A;1;

The lattice parameter of face-centered cubic iron (γ-Fe) is given as 0.3571 nm. The radius of the iron atom is half of the lattice parameter, which is:

r = 0.3571 nm / 2 = 0.17855 nm

The radius of the octahedral void can be calculated using the following formula:

r_void = r_atom + r_atom - r_atom

where r_atom is the radius of the iron atom.

r_void = 0.17855 nm + 0.17855 nm - 0.17855 nm = 0.17855 nm

Packing efficiency = (π√3/4) \* (a^2c) / (a^3)

where a is the lattice parameter and c is the height of the unit cell.

For an ideal HCP structure, the c/a ratio is given by:

c/a = √8/3

Substituting this value into the packing efficiency formula, we get:

Packing efficiency = (π√3/4) \* (a^2√8/3) / (a^3)
= (π√3/4) \* (a/3)
= 0.74

So, the packing efficiency of an ideal HCP structure is 74%.

A) 1.633 and 52%: This is incorrect, as the packing efficiency of an ideal HCP structure is not 52%.

B) 1.633 and 74%: This is correct, as we just calculated the packing efficiency to be 74%.

The angle (in degrees) between the dislocation line and its Burger’s vector is;"To solve this problem, we need to find the angle between the dislocation line and the Burger's vector.

The Burger's vector is given as (a/2)[1 1 0], which is a vector in the [1 1 0] direction with a magnitude of a/2.

The dislocation line is given as [112], which is a direction vector.

To find the angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(θ) = (B·L) / (|B||L|)

where θ is the angle between the two vectors, B is the Burger's vector, L is the dislocation line, and |B| and |L| are the magnitudes of the vectors.

First, let's find the magnitude of the Burger's vector:

|B| = √((a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + 0^2) = √(2a^2/4) = a/√2

Next, let's find the magnitude of the dislocation line:

|L| = √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = √3

Now, we can calculate the dot product:

B·L = ((a/2)[1 1 0])·([112]) = (a/2)(1 + 1 + 0) = a/2

Now, we can plug in the values:

cos(θ) = (a/2) / (a/√2 * √3) = 1/√6

A) Dislocation pile-up

Explanation:

When a metal crystal is plastically deformed at low temperatures, the dislocations can become pinned at impurities, grain boundaries, or other defects, leading to a buildup of dislocation density. This can cause the dislocations to become tangled and form a wavy pattern, known as a ""wavy slip line"" or ""dislocation pile-up"". This is because the dislocations are unable to move freely due to the pinning forces, causing them to bunch up and form a wavy pattern.

The other options are not correct:

B) Large number of slip systems: While multiple slip systems can contribute to plastic deformation, it is not the primary cause of wavy slip lines.

C) Low stacking fault energy: Stacking fault energy is a measure of the energy required to create a stacking fault in a crystal lattice. While low stacking fault energy can affect the plastic deformation behavior of a material, it is not directly related to the formation of wavy slip lines.

D) Dislocation climb: Dislocation climb is a process by which dislocations can move through a crystal lattice by absorbing or emitting vacancies. While dislocation climb can occur during plastic deformation, it is not the primary cause of wavy slip lines.

(C) Low stacking fault energy

Explanation:

Creep resistance is the ability of a material to resist deformation under stress over time. Low stacking fault energy (SFE) can decrease creep resistance in metals because it allows for easier movement of dislocations, which are defects in the crystal lattice that can lead to plastic deformation.

* Small grain size (A) can actually increase creep resistance by reducing the distance that dislocations need to travel to cause deformation.
* Fine dispersoid size (B) can also increase creep resistance by providing additional obstacles to dislocation movement.
* High melting point (D) is not directly related to creep resistance.

If the height of the as-pressed compact is 12 mm, the fill height (in mm) required is?;"To solve this problem, we can start by using the formula for apparent density:

Apparent density = Total mass / Total volume

We are given that the apparent density of the Aluminium powder is 810 kg/m^3. This means that the total mass of the powder is:

Total mass = Apparent density x Total volume
= 810 kg/m^3 x x (assuming the volume of the powder is x m^3)

We are also given that the compact is pressed at 600 MPa and has a height of 12 mm. We can convert the height to meters:

Height = 0.012 m

The volume of the compact can be found using the formula:

Volume = Area x Height
= π x Radius^2 x Height

Since the compact is cylindrical, we need to find the radius. We are given that the as-pressed compact has a density of 1755 kg/m^3. The mass of the compact can be found:

Mass = Density x Volume
= 1755 kg/m^3 x x m^3

We are also given that the fill height is unknown. Let's call it h. Then:

Mass = Density x Volume
= 1755 kg/m^3 x π x Radius^2 x (h + 0.012)

We know that the total mass is equal to the mass of the compact. Therefore:

810 kg/m^3 x x m^3 = 1755 kg/m^3 x π x Radius^2 x (h + 0.012)

Simplifying and rearranging, we get:

Maximum reduction = (Roll diameter - Plate thickness) x Coefficient of friction

In this case, the roll diameter is 200 mm, the plate thickness is 250 mm, and the coefficient of friction is 0.1.

Plugging in the values, we get:

The standard state is pure liquid Si, so the standard Gibbs free energy of pure liquid Si is 0. Therefore, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is:

At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is;"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:

1. Density of liquid metal = 7000 kg/m³
2. Nozzle diameter = 30 mm = 0.03 m (convert mm to m)
3. Nozzle discharge coefficient = 0.80
4. Initial height of liquid metal column = 3.2 m

To find the initial mass flow rate, we can use the equation:

ṁ = ρA molecules V

where:
ṁ is the mass flow rate (kg/s)
ρ is the density (7000 kg/m³)
A is the nozzle area (πr², where r is the nozzle radius)
V is the velocity of the liquid metal stream (m/s)

First, let's find the nozzle radius:

Nozzle diameter = 30 mm = 0.03 m
Nozzle radius (r) = 0.03 m / 2 = 0.015 m

Next, let's find the nozzle area:

Nozzle area (A) = πr² = π(0.015 m)² = 0.001772 m²

Now, let's find the velocity of the liquid metal stream:

ṁ = ρA V

Given the discharge coefficient, we can write:

ṁ = ρA molecules V / (1 - ρA molecules V)

Simplifying, we get:

ṁ = ρA V / ø

Now, let's plug in the given values:

ṁ = (7000 kg/m³) (0.001772 m²) V / 0.80
ṁ ≈ 9.5365 kg/s

* Total Fe = 92 wt.%
* Metallic Fe = 84 wt.%

This means that the weight percentage of Fe (iron) in the DRI is 84%.

The remaining 8% of the weight is not metallic Fe, which is likely to be FeO (iron oxide) and gangue (impurities).

Let's assume the weight percentage of FeO is x. Then, the weight percentage of gangue is (100 - 92 - x) = 8 - x.

We know that the total weight percentage of Fe is 92%, which is the sum of metallic Fe and FeO:

92 = 84 + x

If mould length ($L_m$) is 0.8 m and casting speed ($U_c$) is 0.2 $m.s^(-1)$, the average mould flux (in MW.$m^(-2)$) is?;"To solve this problem, we need to find the average mould heat flux (q_m) over the entire mould length (L_m).

The given equation for mould heat flux (q_m) is:

q_m (z) = [2.67 - 0.33 (z/U_c)^(0.5)] * 10^6

where z is the distance below the meniscus.

We need to find the average mould heat flux (q_m_avg) over the entire mould length (L_m). To do this, we can integrate the mould heat flux equation with respect to distance (z) and divide by the mould length (L_m).

q_m_avg = (1/L_m) * [0, L_m] q_m (z) dz

q_m_avg = (1/0.8) * [0, 0.8] [2.67 - 0.33 (z/0.2)^(0.5)] * 10^6 dz

The slag produced during refining contains 40 wt.% CaO and 22 wt.% FeO. Neglecting material losses, the yield of Fe (in %) is?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. 5 metric tons of lime containing 90 wt.% CaO is used. This means the lime contains 4.5 metric tons of CaO (5 x 0.9).
2. The hot metal contains 93.2 wt.% Fe, which means it contains 93.2/100 x 100 = 93.2 metric tons of Fe.
3. The slag produced contains 40 wt.% CaO, which means it contains 4.5/0.4 = 11.25 metric tons of CaO (from the lime).
4. The slag also contains 22 wt.% FeO, which means it contains 93.2/0.78 x 0.22 = 24.5 metric tons of FeO (from the hot metal).
5. The total weight of the slag is 11.25 + 24.5 = 35.75 metric tons.

At the same temperature, if the pressure is lowered to 0.7 mbar, the equilibrium nitrogen content (in ppm) is?;"To solve this problem, we can use Henry's Law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the pressure of the gas.

The initial equilibrium condition is:

14 ppm of dissolved nitrogen is in equilibrium with 1 mbar of nitrogen gas at 1873 K.

We can write an equation based on Henry's Law:

14 ppm = k × 1 mbar

where k is the Henry's Law constant for nitrogen in steel at 1873 K.

Now, we want to find the equilibrium nitrogen content when the pressure is lowered to 0.7 mbar. We can write another equation based on Henry's Law:

x ppm = k × 0.7 mbar

where x is the new equilibrium nitrogen content.

Since the temperature and the Henry's Law constant k are the same for both equations, we can set up a proportion:

x ppm / 14 ppm = 0.7 mbar / 1 mbar

The following reactions are assumed to be at thermodynamic equilibrium: ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g) and  2CO(g) = $CO_2$(g) + C(s). Assume ideal gas behaviour. Based on mole balance, the relationship applicable to the system at equilibrium is  (A)	$p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$ (B) $p_(Zn)$ = 2*$p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (C) $p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (D) $p_(Zn)$ = 0.5*$p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$;"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of mole balance and the ideal gas equation.

Let's start by writing the mole balance equation for zinc:

[ZnO] - [Zn] = 0

Since ZnO is being reduced to Zn, the number of moles of ZnO decreases by 1 mole for every 1 mole of Zn produced. Therefore, the mole balance equation becomes:

[ZnO] - [Zn] = -1

Now, let's write the mole balance equation for carbon:

[C] - [CO] - [CO2] = 0

Since C is being converted to CO and CO2, the number of moles of C decreases by 1 mole for every 1 mole of CO produced and by 1 mole for every 1 mole of CO2 produced. Therefore, the mole balance equation becomes:

[C] - [CO] - [CO2] = -1

Now, we can use the ideal gas equation to relate the partial pressures of the gases to their mole fractions:

p_Zn = x_Zn \* P_total
p_CO = x_CO \* P_total
p_CO2 = x_CO2 \* P_total

where P_total is the total pressure of the system.

Substituting the mole balance equations into the ideal gas equation, we get:

p_Zn = (1 - x_CO - x_CO2) \* P_total
p_CO = x_CO \* P_total
p_CO2 = x_CO2 \* P_total

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:

K = (p_Zn \* p_CO2) / (p_CO \* p_CO2)

Substituting the expressions for p_Zn, p_CO, and p_CO2, we get:

K = ((1 - x_CO - x_CO2) \* P_total \* x_CO2) / (x_CO \* P_total \* x_CO2)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

K = (1 - x_CO - x_CO2) / x_CO

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:

2CO = CO2 + C

K = (p_CO2 \* p_C) / (p_CO)^2

Substituting the expressions for p_CO2 and p_C, we get:

K = (x_CO2 \* P_total \* x_C) / (x_CO)^2

Simplifying the expression, we get:

K = (x_CO2 / x_CO)^2

Now, we can substitute the expressions for x_CO and x_CO2 into the equilibrium constant expression:

K = ((1 - x_CO - x_CO2) / x_CO)^2

Simplifying the expression, we get:

K = (1 - 2x_CO)^2

Now, we can solve for x_CO:

x_CO = 1 / 2

Substituting the value of x_CO into the expressions for p_Zn, p_CO, and p_CO2, we get:

p_Zn = 1/2 \* P_total
p_CO = 1/2 \* P_total
p_CO2 = 1/2 \* P_total

One of them is an internal crack of length 5 μm and the other is a surface crack of length 3 μm. A tensile stress is applied perpendicular to the crack surfaces. The fracture stress (in MPa) is?;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the stress intensity factor (SIF) for both cracks and then use the SIF to determine the fracture stress.

For the internal crack:

The SIF for an internal crack is given by:

K = Y \* σ \* √(πa)

where K is the stress intensity factor, Y is a geometry factor, σ is the applied stress, and a is the crack length.

Given: Young's Modulus = 70 GPa, Surface energy per unit area = 1 J/m²

We need to find the fracture stress (σ) for the internal crack. Let's assume the fracture stress is σ_f.

The SIF for the internal crack is:

K_int = Y \* σ_f \* √(π \* 5e-6)

For the surface crack:

The SIF for a surface crack is given by:

K = Y \* σ \* √(πa)

where a is the crack length.

Given: Surface crack length = 3 μm = 3e-6 m

The SIF for the surface crack is:

K_surf = Y \* σ_f \* √(π \* 3e-6)

Since the SIF for the internal crack is equal to the SIF for the surface crack, we can set them equal to each other:

K_int = K_surf

Substituting the expressions for K_int and K_surf, we get:

Y \* σ_f \* √(π \* 5e-6) = Y \* σ_f \* √(π \* 3e-6)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

σ_f = √(5/3) \* σ_f

Solving for σ_f, we get:

When a tensile stress is applied along the [100] direction in a FCC metal crystal, the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) is 6 MPa. This means that the stress required to initiate slip on a slip plane is 6 MPa.

To find the tensile stress required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane, we need to consider the orientation of the slip plane and the direction of the applied stress.

The (111) slip plane has a slip direction that is 30° away from the [100] direction. This means that the resolved shear stress on the (111) slip plane is reduced by a factor of √3/2 compared to the applied tensile stress.

So, the CRSS on the (111) slip plane is:

The rule of mixtures states that the elastic modulus of a composite material is given by:

E_c = V_f \* E_f + V_m \* E_m

where E_c is the elastic modulus of the composite, V_f is the volume fraction of the fiber, E_f is the elastic modulus of the fiber, V_m is the volume fraction of the matrix, and E_m is the elastic modulus of the matrix.

In this case, the volume fraction of the fiber (V_f) is 0.4, and the volume fraction of the matrix (V_m) is 0.6. The elastic modulus of the glass fiber (E_f) is 70 GPa, and the elastic modulus of the polymer (E_m) is 3.5 GPa.

where Q is the flow rate, A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe, and v is the velocity of the fluid.

We are given that the flow rate is 4 m³/s, and the height of the sprue is 0.25 m. We can use the equation for the velocity of a fluid flowing through a pipe:

v = √(2gh)

where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²) and h is the height of the sprue.

Substituting the values, we get:

v = √(2 × 9.8 × 0.25) = 2.5 m/s

Now, we can use the equation for the flow rate to find the cross-sectional area at the top of the sprue:

A = Q / v = 4 m³/s / 2.5 m/s = 1.6 m²

Since the cross-sectional area at the top of the sprue is 2.2 m², we need to find the maximum cross-sectional area at the base of the sprue that will prevent aspiration of molten metal.

The maximum cross-sectional area at the base of the sprue will be equal to the cross-sectional area at the top of the sprue, since the flow rate is constant throughout the pipe. Therefore, the maximum cross-sectional area at the base of the sprue is:

The possible reactions are:

1. Reduction of metal oxide (MO) to metal (M): 2MO → 2M + O2
2. Reduction of metal sulfate (MSO4) to metal sulfide (MS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2): MSO4 + 2SO2 → 2MS + 3O2
3. Reduction of metal sulfide (MS) to metal (M) and sulfur (S): 2MS → 2M + S
4. Oxidation of metal (M) to metal oxide (MO): 2M + O2 → 2MO

The equilibrium conditions are:

* The system is at constant temperature and pressure.
* The system is in contact with a source of oxygen (O2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).
* The system is in equilibrium, meaning that the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal.

From the possible reactions, we can see that:

* MO and M can coexist in equilibrium, as they are not directly related by a reaction.
* MS and M can coexist in equilibrium, as they are not directly related by a reaction.
* MSO4 and M can coexist in equilibrium, as they are not directly related by a reaction.
* MO and MSO4 cannot coexist in equilibrium, as they are related by a reaction (MSO4 → MO + SO2).
* MO and MS cannot coexist in equilibrium, as they are related by a reaction (MO → M + O2).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Assuming uniform shrinkage, the linear shrinkage (in %) is? (answer up to two decimal places);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The green density is 55%, which means the compact has a density of 55% of its theoretical density.
2. After sintering, the compact attains a density of 86.5% of its theoretical density.
3. The linear shrinkage is the change in length of the compact due to sintering, expressed as a percentage of the original length.
4. Since the compact has uniform shrinkage, the linear shrinkage is equal to the volumetric shrinkage.
5. The volumetric shrinkage is the difference between the initial volume and the final volume, divided by the initial volume.

Let's denote the initial volume as V1 and the final volume as V2. We can write:

V1 = (theoretical density) × (initial volume)
= (100%) × (initial volume)
= 1

V2 = (86.5%) × (theoretical density) × (initial volume)
= 0.865 × 1
= 0.865

The volumetric shrinkage is:

Volumetric shrinkage = (V1 - V2) / V1
= (1 - 0.865) / 1
= 0.135

The linear shrinkage is the same as the volumetric shrinkage, since the compact has uniform shrinkage. Therefore, the linear shrinkage is:

Linear shrinkage = 0.135

The lattice parameter of the FCC metal is given as 0.401 nm. The radius of the sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void is related to the lattice parameter by the following equation:

r = (a/4√2)

where r is the radius of the sphere and a is the lattice parameter.

Substituting the given value of the lattice parameter, we get:

In an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, the mass fraction of pearlilte just below the eutectoid temperature is? (answer up to two decimal places)";"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The eutectoid composition is 0.8 wt.% carbon, which means that at this composition, the alloy will form a eutectoid mixture of austenite and pearlite.

The carbon content in ferrite is 0.025 wt.%, which means that any carbon present in the alloy will be present in the form of pearlite.

The given alloy contains 0.35 wt.% C, which is greater than the eutectoid composition of 0.8 wt.% C. This means that the alloy will not form a eutectoid mixture, but will instead form a mixture of austenite and pearlite.

To find the mass fraction of pearlite, we need to find the amount of carbon that will be present in the form of pearlite. Let's call this amount x.

The amount of carbon present in the alloy is 0.35 wt.% C, and the amount of carbon present in the eutectoid composition is 0.8 wt.% C. This means that the excess carbon present in the alloy is:

0.35 wt.% C - 0.8 wt.% C = 0.45 wt.% C

This excess carbon will be present in the form of pearlite. Since the carbon content in ferrite is 0.025 wt.%, the carbon content in pearlite is:

0.45 wt.% C / (1 - 0.025 wt.% C) = 0.45 wt.% C / 0.975 = 0.46 wt.% C

Now, we can find the mass fraction of pearlite:

Mass fraction of pearlite = (Mass of pearlite) / (Total mass of alloy)

= (0.46 wt.% C) / (0.35 wt.% C + 0.46 wt.% C)

= 0.565

So, the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature is approximately 0.57.

ρ = (Z × M) / a^3

where  is the density, Z is the number of atoms per unit cell, M is the atomic mass, and a is the lattice parameter.

Rearranging the formula to solve for Z, we get:

Z =  × a^3 / M

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Z = 19000 kg/m^3 × (0.4 nm)^3 / 183 g/mol

First, we need to convert the density from kg/m^3 to g/cm^3:

19000 kg/m^3 × (1000 g/kg) × (1 cm^3/1000 m^3) = 19 g/cm^3

Next, we need to convert the lattice parameter from nm to cm:

0.4 nm × (1 cm/100 nm) = 0.004 cm

Now we can plug in the values:

Z = 19 g/cm^3 × (0.004 cm)^3 / 183 g/mol

Z ≈ 4.33

(B) decrease in the grain size

Explanation:

* Creep resistance refers to a material's ability to resist deformation under constant stress over time. Finer grain sizes can improve creep resistance by reducing the distance that dislocations need to travel to overcome obstacles, making it more difficult for dislocations to move and causing the material to deform.
* Tensile strength refers to a material's ability to withstand external forces without breaking. Finer grain sizes can also improve tensile strength by reducing the number of grain boundaries, which can act as sites for crack initiation and propagation.

Increasing grain size (option A) can actually decrease creep resistance and tensile strength, as larger grains can provide more pathways for dislocations to move and can increase the likelihood of crack formation.

Adding dispersoids (option C) can also improve creep resistance and tensile strength, but it is not the only factor that can achieve this.

Annealing (option D) can improve creep resistance and tensile strength by reducing internal stresses and improving the material's microstructure, but it is not the only factor that can achieve this.";B;C;0;

2. Poisson's ratio (ν) = -Δw/w, where Δw is the change in width and w is the original width.
3. Volumetric strain (εv) = ΔV/V, where ΔV is the change in volume and V is the original volume.

Given:
ε = 0.02 (uniaxial strain)
ν = 0.3 (Poisson's ratio)

We can use the following steps to find the volumetric strain:

1. Find the change in length (ΔL) using the given uniaxial strain:

ΔL = εL = 0.02L

2. Find the change in width (Δw) using Poisson's ratio:

Δw = -νw = -0.3w

3. Find the change in volume (ΔV) using the changes in length and width:

ΔV = ΔLw + LΔw = (0.02L)w + L(-0.3w) = 0.02Lw - 0.3Lw = -0.28Lw

4. Find the volumetric strain (εv) using the change in volume:

We are given the power law behavior of the material, which is:

σ = 50*ε^(0.3)

We are also given that η = 1, which means that the efficiency of the wire drawing process is 100%.

The maximum strain per pass can be found by rearranging the power law equation to solve for ε:

ε = (σ/50)^(1/0.3)

Since η = 1, the maximum strain per pass is equal to the maximum stress per pass divided by the yield stress. The yield stress is not given, but we can find it by rearranging the power law equation to solve for σ:

σ = 50*ε^(0.3)

Substituting ε = 1 (since it's the maximum strain per pass), we get:

So, the yield stress is 50.

The initial rate of heat loss (in KW) from the top surface of slab by radiation and convection is?(answer up to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the heat loss due to radiation and convection separately and then add them up.

Heat loss due to radiation:

The radiation heat transfer coefficient (h_r) can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

h_r = σ \* ε \* (T_s^4 - T_a^4)

where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, ε is the emissivity of the steel, T_s is the temperature of the steel slab (1298 K), and T_a is the ambient temperature (298 K).

h_r = 5.7 * 10^(-8) W/m^2K^4 \* 0.8 \* (1298 K)^4 - (298 K)^4 = 143.4 W/m^2

The heat loss due to radiation can be calculated as:

Q_r = h_r \* A

where A is the area of the top surface of the slab (1 m x 1 m = 1 m^2).

Q_r = 143.4 W/m^2 \* 1 m^2 = 143.4 W

Heat loss due to convection:

The convective heat transfer coefficient (h_c) is given as 4.6 W/m^2K.

The heat loss due to convection can be calculated as:

Q_c = h_c \* A \* (T_s - T_a)

Q_c = 4.6 W/m^2K \* 1 m^2 \* (1298 K - 298 K) = 444.4 W

Total heat loss:

The total heat loss is the sum of the heat loss due to radiation and convection:

Q_total = Q_r + Q_c = 143.4 W + 444.4 W = 587.8 W

To convert this to kilowatts, we divide by 1000:

Q_total = 587.8 W / 1000 = 0.588 kW

First, we need to write the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:

CO(g)  C + O

The equilibrium constant expression is:

K = [CO]/([C][O])

Since the activity coefficients are assumed to be unity, the concentrations can be used instead of activities. The concentration of CO is given by the partial pressure of CO at 1 atm, which is 1 atm. The concentrations of C and O are given by their respective mole fractions.

The mole fraction of C is 0.007 (0.7 wt.% C), and the mole fraction of O is 0.993 (assuming the steel is pure iron, which is a reasonable assumption for a plain carbon steel).

Now, we can plug in the values into the equilibrium constant expression:

K = (1 atm) / (0.007 x 0.993) = 143.33

Now, we can use the given equation for logK to find the value of logK:

logK = (1160/T) + 2.003

Rearranging the equation to solve for T, we get:

T = 1160 / (logK - 2.003)

Plugging in the value of K, we get:

Now, we can use the equation for logK again to find the value of log[O]:

log[O] = (1160/T) + 2.003 - log[CO]

Plugging in the value of T, we get:

log[O] = (1160/1873.15) + 2.003 - log(1) = 0.6225

A stoichiometric mixture of CO and pure oxygen at 1 atm and 25°C flows into a combustion reactor. The molar flow rate of CO entering the reactor is $1kg-mol.h^(-1)$. The adiabatic flame temperature(in K) for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is?(answer up to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Write the balanced equation for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen:

CO + 1/2O2 → CO2

2. Calculate the heat of combustion (ΔH°) at 298 K:

ΔH° = -282000 kJ/(kg-mol CO)

3. Calculate the heat of combustion per mole of CO2 produced:

ΔH° = -282000 kJ/(kg-mol CO) = -282000 kJ/(kg-mol CO2)

4. Calculate the heat of combustion per unit mass of CO2 produced:

Δh° = ΔH° / M_CO2 = -282000 kJ/(kg-mol CO2) / 44 g/mol = -6441 kJ/g

5. Calculate the adiabatic flame temperature (T_f) using the following equation:

T_f = T_0 + (Δh° / C_p)

where T_0 is the initial temperature (25°C = 298 K), Δh° is the heat of combustion per unit mass of CO2 produced, and C_p is the specific heat capacity of CO2.

Plugging in the values, we get:

T_f = 298 K + (-6441 kJ/g / 44 kJ/(kg-mol K)) = 298 K - 146 K = 152 K

Miscellaneous;6;G-META-17-39;NUM;36;A solution contains $10^(-3)$ M of $Fe^(+3)$ at 25°C. The solubility product of $Fe(OH)_3$ is $10^(-39)$. Assuming activity equals concentration, the minimum pH at which $Fe^(+3)$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is?(answer up to two decimals places);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the concentration of $OH^-$ ions at which $Fe^{3+}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$. Since the solubility product of $Fe(OH)_3$ is $10^{-39}$, we can set up the equation:

[Fe^(+3)][OH^(-)]^3 = 10^{-39}

We can start by assuming a pH value and calculating the corresponding [OH^-] concentration. Let's use the pH value to calculate [OH^-]:

pH = -log[OH^-]
pOH = 14 - pH
[OH^-] = 10^(-pOH)

For example, if we assume a pH of 6.5, we can calculate the corresponding [OH^-] concentration:

pH = 6.5
pOH = 14 - pH = 7.5
[OH^-] = 10^(-7.5) = 3.16 × 10^(-8) M

Substituting this value into the solubility product equation:

(10^(-3) M)[3.16 × 10^(-8) M]^3 = 10^(-39)

Simplifying the equation:

(0.001) × (3.16 × 10^(-21)) = 10^(-39)

Using the rules of exponents:

(0.001) × 3.16 = 0.00316
0.00316 × 10^(-21) = 3.16 × 10^(-21)
0.00316 × 10^(-21) = 10^(-21) + 3.16

Since 10^(-21) is less than 3.16, this value is too small. Therefore, Fe^(+3) will not precipitate as Fe(OH)_3 at this pH.

However, if we assume a pH of 6.6:

pH = 6.6
pOH = 14 - pH = 7.4
[OH^-] = 10^(-pOH) = 2.51 × 10^(-8) M

Substituting this value into the solubility product equation:

(10^(-3) M)[2.51 × 10^(-8) M]^3 = 10^(-39)

Simplifying the equation:

(0.001) × (2.51 × 10^(-21)) = 10^(-39)

Using the rules of exponents:

(0.001) × 2.51 = 0.00251
0.00251 × 10^(-21) = 2.51 × 10^(-21)
0.00251 × 10^(-21) = 10^(-21) - 2.51

This value is greater than 10^(-39), so Fe^(+3) will precipitate as Fe(OH)_3 at this pH.

The minimum pH at which Fe^(+3) will precipitate as Fe(OH)_3 is pH = 6.6, accurate up to two decimal places.

Electrical Properties;29;G-META-17-40;NUM;43;Given: Atomic weight of Zn = 65. A zinc electrowinning cell is being operated at a current of 400A, voltage of 3.5V, and a cathodic current efficiency of 90%. The specific energy consumption (in $kJ.kg^(-1) zinc) is? (answer up to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total energy consumption in kWh, and then convert it to kJ/kg of zinc.

First, we need to calculate the total energy consumption in kWh:

Energy consumption (kWh) = Current (A) x Voltage (V) x Time (h)
= 400 A x 3.5 V x (1 h / 3600 s) (assuming 1 hour of operation)
= 4.17 kWh

Since the current efficiency is 90%, the actual energy consumption is:

Actual energy consumption (kWh) = Energy consumption (kWh) / Current efficiency (%)
= 4.17 kWh / 90%
= 4.63 kWh

Now, we need to convert the actual energy consumption from kWh to kJ:

1 kWh = 3,600,000 J
So, 1 kJ = 3.6 J

Actual energy consumption (kJ) = Actual energy consumption (kWh) x 3,600,000 J/kWh
= 4.63 kWh x 3,600,000 J/kWh
= 16,668,000 J

Since the atomic weight of Zn is 65, the mass of zinc produced is:

Mass of Zn (kg) = Current (A) x Time (h) / Atomic weight of Zn (g/mol)
= 400 A x 1 h / 65 g/mol
= 6.15 kg

Now, we can calculate the specific energy consumption in kJ/kg of zinc:

Specific energy consumption (kJ/kg) = Actual energy consumption (kJ) / Mass of Zn (kg)
= 16,668,000 J / 6.15 kg
= 2,714.5 kJ/kg

Applying Third law of thermodynamics, the value of entropy (in $J.K^(-1)$) of transformation of 368.5 K is ?(answer up to two decimal places);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The entropy change associated with heating orthorhombic sulfur from 0 K to 368.5 K is 36.86 J/K.
2. The entropy change associated with cooling monoclinic sulfur from 368.5 K to 0 K is -37.8 J/K.
3. Since the transformation from orthorhombic to monoclinic sulfur occurs above 368.5 K, the entropy change for this transformation is the difference between the entropy change for heating and cooling:

ΔS = ΔS_heating - ΔS_cooling
= 36.86 J/K - (-37.8 J/K)
= 74.66 J/K

The conductivity (σ) can be calculated using the formula:

σ = neμe + npμh

where ne is the electron concentration, np is the hole concentration, μe is the electron mobility, and μh is the hole mobility.

Rearranging the formula to solve for ne, we get:

ne = σ / (μe + μh)

Substituting the given values, we get:

ne = 10^(-6) Ω^(-1) m^(-1) / (0.75 m^2 V^(-1) s^(-1) + 0.06 m^2 V^(-1) s^(-1)) = 1.11 × 10^12 m^(-3)

The length of the crack (in m) after one million cycles will be?(answer up to three decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we need to find the change in crack length (Δa) after one million cycles. We can do this by using the given equation:

da/dN = 10^(-12) (ΔK)^3

We are given that:

σ(maximum) = 200 MPa
σ(minimum) = 0 (i.e., the minimum stress is zero, which means the crack is growing under tension)

The stress intensity factor (K) can be calculated using the following formula:

K = σ√πa

where a is the crack length.

Since the minimum stress is zero, the maximum stress (200 MPa) will be the only stress contributing to the crack growth. Therefore, we can use the maximum stress to calculate the stress intensity factor:

K = 200 MPa√πa

We are given that the initial crack length is 1 mm = 0.001 m. After one million cycles, the crack length will increase by Δa. The new crack length will be a + Δa.

The change in stress intensity factor (ΔK) can be calculated as:

ΔK = K(a + Δa) - K(a)

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔK = 200 MPa√π(a + Δa) - 200 MPa√πa

Now, we can use the given equation to find Δa:

da/dN = 10^(-12) (ΔK)^3

Substituting the values, we get:

Δa / N = 10^(-12) (ΔK)^3

where N is the number of cycles (one million in this case).

Rearranging the equation to solve for Δa, we get:

Δa = 10^(-12) (ΔK)^3 N

Substituting the values, we get:

Δa = 10^(-12) (200 MPa√π(a + Δa) - 200 MPa√πa)^3 × 10^6

Simplifying and solving for Δa, we get:

Δa ≈ 0.001 + 0.000

Given:

* Avrami exponent (n) = 2
* Recrystallization is 20% complete after 100s

We can use the Avrami equation to model the transformation:

α(t) = 1 - exp(-kt^n)

where α(t) is the fraction transformed at time t, k is a constant, and n is the Avrami exponent.

We are given that α(100) = 0.20, so we can plug this into the equation:

0.20 = 1 - exp(-k(100)^2)
0.20 = 1 - exp(-10000k)

Now, we want to find α(400), which is the fraction transformed after 400 seconds. We can plug this value into the equation again:

α(400) = 1 - exp(-k(400)^2)
= 1 - exp(-160000k)

We are asked to find the transformation (in %) in 400s, which is equivalent to finding α(400). We can use the fact that α(t) is a dimensionless quantity, so we can express it as a percentage by multiplying it by 100:

α(400) × 100 = 100(1 - exp(-160000k))

Now, we can use the fact that α(100) = 0.20 to find the value of k:

0.20 = 1 - exp(-10000k)
exp(-10000k) = 0.80
k = -ln(0.80) / 10000
 0.0072

The standard cell potential (E°) is the sum of the standard reduction potentials (E°red) of the two half-reactions:

E° = E°red(reduction) - E°red(oxidation)

The ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is? (answer up to three decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of resilience to toughness for the given material.

Resilience (U) is the energy absorbed by the material up to the point of fracture, and toughness (Uc) is the energy absorbed by the material up to the point of fracture.

First, we need to find the strain at which the material yields:

E = σ/Y
4.5 GPa = 450 MPa / Y
Y = 450 MPa / (4.5 GPa) = 100 MPa

The material yields at a strain of:

εy = σy / E
= 450 MPa / (4.5 GPa)
= 0.1

The material fractures at a strain of 0.45.

The resilience (U) is the area under the stress-strain curve up to the point of yield:

U = [0, εy] σ dε
= [0, 0.1] σ dε
= σy εy
= 450 MPa × 0.1
= 45 MPa

The toughness (Uc) is the area under the stress-strain curve up to the point of fracture:

Uc = [0, 0.45] σ dε
= [0, 0.1] σ dε + [0.1, 0.45] σ dε
= σy εy + [0.1, 0.45] σ dε
= 45 MPa + [0.1, 0.45] σ dε

To find the integral, we need to know the stress-strain curve beyond the yield point. Since the material is perfectly elastic-plastic, the stress remains constant at the yield stress (450 MPa) beyond the yield point. Therefore:

[0.1, 0.45] σ dε = 450 MPa × (0.45 - 0.1)
= 157.5 MPa

The toughness is:

Uc = 45 MPa + 157.5 MPa
= 202.5 MPa

The ratio of resilience to toughness is:

U/Uc = 45 MPa / 202.5 MPa

(answer up tp two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use Chvorinov's equation, which is:

t  V^n

where t is the solidification time, V is the volume of the casting or riser, and n is the exponent.

We are given that the exponent n is 2, and the total time for solidification of the cubic casting is 1.6 minutes. We can write an equation based on Chvorinov's rule:

1.6 = kV^2

where k is a constant.

We are also given that the time for solidification of the cylindrical riser is 3.2 minutes. We can write another equation based on Chvorinov's rule:

3.2 = kV_r^2

where V_r is the volume of the riser.

We can set up a ratio of these two equations to eliminate the constant k:

(1.6 / 3.2) = (V / V_r)^2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.5 = (V / V_r)^2

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

V / V_r = √0.5

We are given that the diameter-to-height ratio of the riser is 0.5, which means that the height of the riser is half of its diameter. Let's call the diameter of the riser ""d"". Then, the height of the riser is d/2.

The volume of the riser is:

V_r = (π/4) * d^2 * (d/2)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

V_r = (π/8) * d^3

We can substitute this expression for V_r into the equation we derived earlier:

V / (π/8) * d^3 = √0.5

Simplifying this equation, we get:

V / d^3 = 2√2 / π

We are given that the dimensions of the cubic casting are 5.0 cm x 5.0 cm x 5.0 cm, so the volume of the casting is:

V = 125 cm^3

Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:

125 / d^3 = 2√2 / π

Simplifying this equation, we get:

d^3 = 125 * π / (2√2)

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

d = (125 * π / (2√2))^(1/3)

d ≈ 4.47 cm

The height of the riser is half of its diameter, so:

Height of riser ≈ 4.47 / 2 ≈ 2.23 cm

If the size of tungsten grains is 40 µm and the interfacial tungsten -tungsten and tungsten- nickel energies are 0.52 and 0.30 $J.m^(-2)$ respectively, the predicted avergae neck size (in µm) of sintered tungsten grain is:  (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 25;"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of liquid phase sintering and the calculation of average neck size.

Liquid phase sintering occurs when a liquid phase is present at the interface between two particles, allowing them to bond together. In this case, the liquid phase is the molten nickel, which is present at 1500°C.

The average neck size can be calculated using the following equation:

d = (γ1 + γ2) / (2σ)

where:
d = average neck size
γ1 = interfacial energy between tungsten-tungsten (0.52 J/m²)
γ2 = interfacial energy between tungsten-nickel (0.30 J/m²)
σ = surface tension of the molten nickel (not given, but we can assume it to be around 1-2 J/m²)

First, let's calculate the total interfacial energy:

γ1 + γ2 = 0.52 + 0.30 = 0.82 J/m²

Now, we can plug in the values into the equation:

d = (0.82) / (2σ)

Since we don't know the exact value of σ, we can't calculate the exact value of d. However, we can make an estimate. Let's assume σ is around 1.5 J/m² (a reasonable value for a metal alloy).

d = (0.82) / (2 × 1.5) ≈ 17.3 µm

Rounding up to the nearest integer, the predicted average neck size is approximately 20 µm.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

At 300°C and $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd in $mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd is? (answer up to one decimal place);"To solve this problem, we can use Henry's Law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas.

Given:

Solubility at 1 atm: 1.64 x 10^4 mm^3 (STP) / kg
Pressure at 1 atm: 1 atm = 1.01325 bar = 760 mmHg
Pressure at unknown: 0.09 atm = 0.088575 bar = 108 mmHg

We can set up a proportion to solve for the unknown solubility:

where x is the desired answer. To simplify the proportion, we can divide both sides by 1.64 x 10^4:

x / 1.64 x 10^4 = 0.09 / 1
x ≈ 1.24 x 10^3 mm^3 (STP) / kg

Slip in hcp metals occurs on the prismatic planes {1 0 0 1} and {1 1 0 0} with the slip direction <1 1 -2 0>. The slip direction is a result of the Burgers vector, which is a combination of the a and c lattice parameters.

Here's a brief explanation:

In the Jominy end-quench test, a specimen of eutectoid plain-carbon steel is heated to a high temperature and then quenched in water. The resulting microstructure is a function of the distance from the quenched end, with the microstructure changing as you move away from the quenched end.

The sequence of microstructures observed from the quenched end is:

1. Martensite (at the quenched end): This is due to the rapid cooling rate, which prevents the formation of pearlite.
2. Martensite and Pearlite (a short distance away from the quenched end): As the cooling rate slows down slightly, some pearlite starts to form, but martensite is still present.
3. Fine Pearlite (further away from the quenched end): As the cooling rate slows down further, more pearlite forms, and the pearlite becomes finer in size.

A copper-aluminium diffusion couple develops a certain concentration profile after an isothermal treatment at 600°C for 10 hours. The time(in hours to 1 decimal place) required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is;"To solve this question, we can use the concept of time-temperature relationships in diffusion. Since the diffusion coefficient increases by a factor of 2 when the temperature increases by 100 K, we can calculate the ratio of diffusion coefficients at 500°C and 600°C:

(Diffusion coefficient at 600°C) / (Diffusion coefficient at 500°C) = 8 * 10^(-13) / 4 * 10^(-14) = 2

Since the diffusion coefficient at 600°C is twice the diffusion coefficient at 500°C, the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C will be twice the time required at 600°C.

Given that the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 600°C is 10 hours, the time required at 500°C would be:

What is the excess molar free energy, $𝐺^(XS,L)$, for an alloy with 𝑥 = 0.5 at 𝑇 = 1000 K?  (A) 1000 J $mol^(-1)$ (B) - 2000 J $mol^(-1)$ (C) 4763 J $mol^(-1)$ (D) - 5763 J $mol^(-1)$;"To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the excess molar free energy, GXS,L, for an alloy with x = 0.5 at T = 1000 K.

First, we can simplify the expression for G(L)(T,x) by recognizing that the first two terms are the molar free energies of the pure components, which do not depend on the composition x. Therefore, we can write:

G(L)(T,x) = RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x)

Now, we can evaluate this expression for x = 0.5:

G(L)(T,0.5) = RT[0.5ln0.5 + 0.5ln0.5] + 4000(0.5)(0.5)
= RT[ln(0.5^2)] + 1000
= RT[ln(0.25)] + 1000

Next, we can evaluate the molar free energies of the pure components, (G(A))^(0,L) and (G(B))^(0,L). Since these are given as constants, we can simply subtract them from G(L)(T,0.5) to get the excess molar free energy:

GXS,L = G(L)(T,0.5) - [(1-x)*G(A)^(0,L) + x*G(B)^(0,L)]
= RT[ln(0.25)] + 1000 - [(1-0.5)*G(A)^(0,L) + 0.5*G(B)^(0,L)]

Now, we can plug in the given value of T = 1000 K and the value of x = 0.5:

GXS,L = (8.314 J/mol*K)[ln(0.25)] + 1000 - [(1-0.5)*G(A)^(0,L) + 0.5*G(B)^(0,L)]

To evaluate this expression, we need to know the values of (G(A))^(0,L) and (G(B))^(0,L). Unfortunately, these values are not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot evaluate the expression exactly.

However, we can try to estimate the value of GXS,L by making some assumptions about the values of (G(A))^(0,L) and (G(B))^(0,L). For example, if we assume that the molar free energies of the pure components are equal, then:

GXS,L = RT[ln(0.25)] + 1000

Using the given value of T = 1000 K, we get:

GXS,L = (8.314 J/mol*K)[ln(0.25)] + 1000

Assertion [A]: For a material exhibiting Coble creep, a reduction in grain size results in a significant increase in creep rate.

Reason [R]: Grain boundaries act as a barrier to motion of dislocations.

Coble creep is a type of creep that occurs in ceramics and other materials with high grain boundary resistance. In Coble creep, the grain boundaries act as a source of vacancies, which helps to facilitate the diffusion of atoms along the grain boundaries. This process allows the material to deform plastically.

Now, let's consider the reason: Grain boundaries act as a barrier to motion of dislocations. This is actually true for materials that exhibit dislocation creep, not Coble creep. In dislocation creep, the movement of dislocations is hindered by grain boundaries, which can lead to a reduction in creep rate.

However, in Coble creep, the grain boundaries are not a barrier to dislocation motion. Instead, they are a source of vacancies, which facilitates the diffusion of atoms along the grain boundaries. Therefore, reducing the grain size would not necessarily increase the creep rate in Coble creep.

Assertion (A): Refractory BCC metals like W and Mo are less ductile than FCC metals like Ni and Pt at room temperature.

Reason (R): BCC metals have fewer independent slip systems than FCC metals.

The correct answer is:

(A) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A].

Here's why:

* Refractory BCC metals like W and Mo are indeed less ductile than FCC metals like Ni and Pt at room temperature. This is because BCC metals have a more complex crystal structure, which makes it more difficult for them to deform by slip (plastic deformation).
* The reason for this is that BCC metals have fewer independent slip systems than FCC metals. In a BCC lattice, there are only three independent slip systems, whereas in an FCC lattice, there are 12 independent slip systems. This means that FCC metals can deform more easily by slip, making them more ductile.

Therefore, both the assertion and reason are true, and the reason is the correct explanation for the assertion.";A;D;0;

Pick the correct answer based on the information provided above: Note: The glass fibre contains a population of flaws of different lengths.  (A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture (B) The fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture (D) The fibre will undergo buckling;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the critical stress intensity factor (Kc) of the glass fiber. The critical stress intensity factor is given by:

Kc = σ√(2Eγ)

where σ is the tensile stress, E is the elastic modulus, and γ is the surface energy.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Kc = 20 MPa√(2 × 70 GPa × 0.3 J/m²) = 1.47 MPa√m

The critical stress intensity factor is a measure of the fiber's resistance to crack propagation. If the applied stress is less than the critical stress intensity factor, the fiber will not fracture.

In this case, the applied stress (20 MPa) is less than the critical stress intensity factor (1.47 MPa√m), so the fiber will not fracture. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Thermodynamics;73;G-META-18-39;MCQS-NUM;32;If the solid-liquid interfacial energy increases by 10%, the energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation of a spherical solid from the liquid, will change by:  (A) 21% (B) 33% (C) -10% (D) 46%;"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of homogeneous nucleation and the energy barrier involved.

Homogeneous nucleation is the process of a solid forming spontaneously from a liquid without the presence of a nucleus or impurity. The energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation is the energy required for a critical nucleus to form in the liquid, which is necessary for the solid to precipitate out of the solution.

The energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation can be expressed as:

ΔG = γ \* (4 \* π \* r^2) / (3 \* )

where ΔG is the energy barrier, γ is the solid-liquid interfacial energy, r is the radius of the critical nucleus, and  is the density of the solid.

If the solid-liquid interfacial energy increases by 10%, the energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation will also increase by 10%. However, this increase in energy barrier will also affect the radius of the critical nucleus.

To find the percentage change in the energy barrier, we need to calculate the percentage change in the radius of the critical nucleus.

The radius of the critical nucleus is related to the energy barrier by the following equation:

r = (2 \* γ) / (3 \* )

If the solid-liquid interfacial energy increases by 10%, the radius of the critical nucleus will also increase by 10%.

The energy barrier is proportional to the square of the radius of the critical nucleus, so the percentage change in the energy barrier will be:

ΔG / G = (2 \* Δr / r) + (Δr / r)^2

where ΔG is the change in energy barrier, G is the original energy barrier, Δr is the change in radius, and r is the original radius.

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔG / G = (2 \* 0.1) + (0.1)^2 = 0.21

The Young’s modulus of fiber and matrix, respectively are $𝐸_𝑓$ = 250 GPa and $𝐸_𝑚$ = 2.5 GPa. If the composite is subjected to longitudinal loading (iso-strain condition and assuming elastic response), what is the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement rounded off to two decimal places?;"To solve this problem, we can use the rule of mixtures to calculate the composite's Young's modulus, and then use that to calculate the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement.

The rule of mixtures states that the composite's Young's modulus (Ec) is given by:

Ec = Vf * Ef + Vm * Em

where Vf is the volume fraction of fibers, Ef is the Young's modulus of the fibers, Vm is the volume fraction of matrix, and Em is the Young's modulus of the matrix.

Given the problem statement, we know:

Vf = 0.25 (25% volume fraction of fibers)
Ef = 250 GPa
Vm = 0.75 (since Vf + Vm = 1)
Em = 2.5 GPa

Plugging in these values, we get:

Ec = 0.25 * 250 GPa + 0.75 * 2.5 GPa
= 62.5 GPa

Now, we can use the composite's Young's modulus to calculate the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement. Since the composite is subjected to longitudinal loading, the stress in the composite is equal to the stress in the fibers. Let's call the stress in the composite σc. Then, the stress in the fibers is also σc.

The load borne by the reinforcement is proportional to the stress in the fibers, which is σc. The load borne by the matrix is proportional to the stress in the matrix, which is σc * Vm / Vf.

The total load is equal to the sum of the loads borne by the reinforcement and the matrix:

σc * Vf = σc * Vm

Simplifying, we get:

Vf / Vm = 1

Substituting the values, we get:

0.25 / 0.75 = 1

Now, we can calculate the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement:

Fraction of load borne by reinforcement = Vf / (Vf + Vm)
= 0.25 / (0.25 + 0.75)
= 0.25 / 1
= 0.25

The volume of a unit cell in a BCC lattice is given by:

V_BCC = (a^3) = (0.293 nm)^3 = 0.0214 nm^3

The volume of a unit cell in an FCC lattice is given by:

The volume change is given by:

ΔV = V_FCC - V_BCC = 0.0441 nm^3 - 0.0214 nm^3 = 0.0227 nm^3

In this case, we are given the vapor pressure of pure Zn at 710 K, which is 3.6 * 10^(-4) atm. We are also given the expression for the Raoultian activity coefficient of Zn in the Zn-Cd alloy liquid at 710 K, which is:

Thermodynamics;102;G-META-18-51;NUM;74;Given: Gas constant R = 8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$. For the reaction: 4Ag(s, pure) + $O_2$(g) ⟶ $2Ag_(2)O$(s, pure), the standard enthalpy change, ∆𝐻° = − 61080 J, and the standard entropy change, ∆𝑆° = − 132.22 J $K^(−1)$ , in the temperature range from 298 K to 500 K. The temperature(in K to one decimal place). above which $Ag_(2)O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm is?;"To solve this problem, we can use the following equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

where ΔG° is the standard free energy change, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS° is the standard entropy change.

We are given the values of ΔH° and ΔS°:

ΔH° = -61080 J
ΔS° = -132.22 J/K

We are also given the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) = 0.3 atm.

The reaction is:

4Ag(s) + O2(g) → 2Ag2O(s)

The standard free energy change (ΔG°) at a given temperature (T) can be calculated using the equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

We want to find the temperature above which Ag2O decomposes, so we set ΔG° = 0:

0 = ΔH° - TΔS°

Rearranging the equation to solve for T:

T = ΔH° / ΔS°

Substituting the given values:

T = (-61080 J) / (-132.22 J/K) = 462.5 K

So, the temperature above which Ag2O decomposes is approximately 462.5 K.

What is the wavelength of X-rays in nm rounded off to three decimal places? Given: The lattice parameter of iron = 0.287 nm;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation, which relates the wavelength of X-rays to the lattice parameter of the material and the angle of diffraction.

The Bragg equation is:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of X-rays, d is the lattice parameter, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

We are given that the first peak occurs at 2θ = 68.7°, which means that θ = 34.35°. We are also given that the lattice parameter of iron is 0.287 nm.

Plugging in the values, we get:

nλ = 2(0.287 nm)sin(34.35°)

Simplifying and solving for λ, we get:

λ ≈ 0.154 nm

Thermodynamics;103;G-META-18-53;NUM;74;Given: Specific heat capacity of copper (between 250 K and 500 K) is 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ . Assume that the system containing the two pieces of copper remains isolated during this process. A 1 mol piece of copper at 400 K is brought in contact with another 1 mol piece of copper at 300 K, and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. The entropy(in J $K^(-1)$ to three decimal places) change for this process is?;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the system. Since the system is isolated, the total entropy change is zero. However, we can calculate the entropy change for each piece of copper separately.

The entropy change for a system is given by the formula:

ΔS = (dQ / T)

where dQ is the heat added to the system and T is the temperature.

For the 1 mol piece of copper at 400 K, the heat added is:

dQ = mcΔT

where m is the mass of copper (1 mol) and c is the specific heat capacity (22.6 J/K/mol). The temperature change is:

ΔT = T2 - T1 = 400 K - 300 K = 100 K

So, the heat added is:

dQ = (1 mol)(22.6 J/K/mol)(100 K) = 2260 J

The entropy change for this piece of copper is:

ΔS = (dQ / T) = (2260 J / 400 K) = 5.65 J/K

Similarly, for the 1 mol piece of copper at 300 K, the heat added is:

dQ = -2260 J (since heat is transferred from the hotter piece to the cooler piece)

The entropy change for this piece of copper is:

ΔS = (dQ / T) = (-2260 J / 300 K) = -7.53 J/K

The total entropy change for the system is the sum of the entropy changes for each piece of copper:

ΔS = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = 5.65 J/K - 7.53 J/K = -1.88 J/K

So, the correct answer is:

Mechanical Properties;83;G-META-18-55;NUM;48;The ideal plastic work involved in extruding a cylindrical billet of length 100 mm, from an initial diameter of 20 mm to a final diameter of 16 mm is?(in J to one decimal place). The flow stress in compression is 40 MPa, and remains constant throughout the process.;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume reduction ratio and then use the ideal plastic work formula.

Volume reduction ratio (VR) = Initial volume / Final volume
= π × (10 mm)^2 × 100 mm / π × (8 mm)^2 × 100 mm
= 1.25

Ideal plastic work (Wp) = Flow stress × Volume reduction ratio
= 40 MPa × 1.25
= 50 MPa

Since the flow stress is constant, we can use the ideal plastic work formula:

Wp = σ × ΔV

where σ is the flow stress and ΔV is the volume reduction.

ΔV = Initial volume - Final volume
= π × (10 mm)^2 × 100 mm - π × (8 mm)^2 × 100 mm
= 0.125π × (10^2 - 8^2) × 100 mm
= 0.125π × 20 × 100 mm
= 62.83 mm^3

Wp = 40 MPa × 62.83 mm^3
= 2513.2 J

So, the ideal plastic work involved in extruding the cylindrical billet is approximately 2513.1 J.";-;555.5 TO 565.5;0;

(A) 0.06 (B) 0.002 (C) 0.02 (D) 0.0002;"To solve this problem, we can use Henry's law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas.

We are given that at a partial pressure of CO of 1 atm, the value of K is 0.002. This means that at 1 atm, the solubility of C and O in the steel bath is such that the product of their concentrations is 0.002.

Let's denote the concentration of C as x and the concentration of O as y. Then, we can write:

xy = 0.002

We are also given that the partial pressure of CO is reduced to 0.1 atm. According to Henry's law, the solubility of CO in the steel bath will also decrease. Let's denote the new concentration of C as x' and the new concentration of O as y'. Then, we can write:

x'y' = K(0.1)

We are asked to find the value of K when the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm. We can set up an equation using the fact that the product of the concentrations of C and O is constant:

xy = x'y'

Substituting the values, we get:

0.002 = x'(0.1)

Simplifying, we get:

x' = 0.02

Now, we can find the value of K:

K = x'y' = (0.02)(0.1) = 0.002

So, the correct answer is (B) 0.002.";B;D;0;

* P. Aluminium alloys: Aluminum alloys are prone to corrosion, but they can be passivated by applying a thin layer of aluminum oxide over the surface, which provides protection against corrosion.
* R. Stainless steel: Stainless steel is a corrosion-resistant metal that can be further protected by passivation, which involves removing surface impurities and contaminants to form a thin layer of chromium oxide that prevents corrosion.
* Q. Mild steel: Mild steel is a type of carbon steel that is prone to corrosion. While it can be coated or polished to reduce its reactivity, it is not typically passivated in the same way as aluminum alloys and stainless steel.

(B) Mg

During low strain rate deformation (≤ 0.1 per second) at room temperature, magnesium (Mg) is known to deform by twinning mode. This is because magnesium has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal structure, which is prone to twinning due to its limited slip systems.

In contrast, iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and nickel (Ni) have face-centered cubic (fcc) or body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structures, which are more resistant to twinning and tend to deform by slip or other mechanisms.

* Alligatoring is a defect that occurs in sheet metal forming when the metal forms a rough, cracked, or scaly pattern, resembling the skin of an alligator. This is often caused by uneven shrinkage or contraction of the metal as it cools, leading to a rough surface.
* Extrusion (A) is a process that involves forcing material through a die to create a desired shape. Alligatoring is not typically associated with this process.
* Deep drawing (B) is a sheet metal forming process that involves shaping a metal sheet into a cup-like shape. While alligatoring can occur in deep drawing, it's not unique to this process.

The Bragg angle (θ) for the reflection from (111) planes is 21.68°. The wavelength of X-rays (in nm, rounded off to three decimal places) is;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the distance between the (111) planes, and θ is the Bragg angle.

First, we need to find the distance between the (111) planes. The lattice parameter is given as 0.3615 nm, and the (111) planes have a spacing of:

d = a / √3

where a is the lattice parameter. Plugging in the value, we get:

If the entry velocity is 10 $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$ , the exit velocity of the plate (in $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$ , rounded off to one decimal place) is? Assume no change in the width of the plate;"To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of mass and the conservation of momentum.

Conservation of mass:

Let's assume the plate is rolled to a thickness of 3 cm, which means the volume of the plate remains the same. The initial volume of the plate is:

V_initial = width x thickness x length
= 100 cm x 5 cm x length
= 500 cm^3

The final volume of the plate is also:

V_final = width x thickness x length
= 100 cm x 3 cm x length
= 300 cm^3

Since the volume remains the same, we can set up the equation:

500 cm^3 = 300 cm^3

This means the length of the plate remains the same, which is not relevant to the problem.

Conservation of momentum:

Let's consider a small element of the plate with a width of dx and a thickness of 5 cm. The mass of this element is:

dm =  x dx x 5 cm

where  is the density of the plate.

The initial velocity of this element is 10 cm/s. The final velocity of this element is v_f.

The momentum of this element initially is:

p_initial = dm x v_initial
=  x dx x 5 cm x 10 cm/s

The final momentum of this element is:

p_final = dm x v_f

Since the momentum is conserved, we can set up the equation:

p_initial = p_final

Substituting the values, we get:

ρ x dx x 5 cm x 10 cm/s =  x dx x 5 cm x v_f

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1. The rod is 50 cm long, and the bottom of the rod is initially 30 cm away from the wall. This means that the top of the rod is 50 - 30 = 20 cm away from the wall.
2. As the bottom of the rod is pulled horizontally away from the wall at a rate of 4 cm/s, the distance between the bottom of the rod and the wall increases by 4 cm every second.
3. Since the top of the rod is 20 cm away from the wall, and the distance between the bottom of the rod and the wall is increasing by 4 cm every second, the top of the rod will start sliding down the wall when the distance between the bottom of the rod and the wall reaches 20 cm.

Given:

* Vapour pressure of pure zinc (pzn)° at 900K is 0.027 atm
* Henry's law coefficient (γzb)° for zinc at infinite dilution solution in lead on Raoultian scale is 8.55
* 1 torr = 1.316 * 10^(-3) atm

We need to find the partial pressure of zinc (in torr) in equilibrium with a liquid lead containing 0.03 mole % zinc at 900K.

First, we need to find the mole fraction of zinc (xzn) in the solution:

Mole fraction of zinc = Mole percentage of zinc / 100
= 0.03 / 100
= 0.0003

Now, we can use Henry's law to find the partial pressure of zinc:

pzn = γzn * xzn * pzn)°

where pzn is the partial pressure of zinc, γzn is the Henry's law coefficient, xzn is the mole fraction of zinc, and pzn)° is the vapour pressure of pure zinc.

Assume ideal gas behavior. A 50 mm (diameter) sphere of solid nickel is oxidized in a gas mixture containing 60% argon and 40% oxygen by volume. The rate of oxidation of nickel is controlled by the rate of transport of oxygen through the concentration boundary layer. The rate of oxidation (in moles of nickel per minute (mol/min), rounded off to two decimal places) is";"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the concentration of oxygen at the surface of the solid (C0) using the ideal gas law:

C0 = P0 / RT

where P0 is the partial pressure of oxygen at the surface, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature.

P0 = (60% of 1 atm) x (0.4) = 0.24 atm

C0 = 0.24 atm / (8.205 x 10^-5 m^3 atm^-1 K^-1 x 1173 K) = 0

This is given in the problem statement.

2. Calculate the mass transfer coefficient (k) using the given value of the boundary layer mass transfer coefficient (k'):

k = k' x (D / L)

where D is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the gas mixture and L is the diameter of the sphere.

The diffusion coefficient of oxygen in a gas mixture can be estimated using the following formula:

D = (1 / (1 / D_A + 1 / D_B))

where D_A and D_B are the diffusion coefficients of oxygen and argon, respectively.

D_A = 0.21 cm^2 s^-1 (at 1173 K)

D_B = 0.17 cm^2 s^-1 (at 1173 K)

D = (1 / (1 / 0.21 + 1 / 0.17)) = 0.23 cm^2 s^-1

k = 0.03 m s^-1 x (0.23 cm^2 s^-1 / 0.025 m) = 0.021 m s^-1

3. Calculate the rate of oxidation (r) using the following formula:

r = k x C0 x A

where A is the surface area of the sphere.

A = 4 x π x (0.025 m)^2 = 0.0491 m^2

Equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen (in wt.%, rounded off to three decimal places) in pure liquid iron, exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K, is?";"To solve this problem, we need to use Sieverts' law and convert the given equation into a concentration expression.

Given the equation: log10K[N] = [-518/T - 1.063]

where K[N] has the dimension of atm-1/2. We need to rearrange the equation to express K[N] in terms of temperature T.

K[N] = 10^(518/T + 1.063)

Now, we need to relate K[N] to the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the iron.

K[N] is the equilibrium constant, which describes the equilibrium between the nitrogen gas phase and the dissolved nitrogen in the iron. The concentration of dissolved nitrogen is related to K[N] by the expression:

[h_N] = [wt.%N] / K[N]

We are given that [j_N] = [wt.%N], which means that [wt.%N] is the Henry's law constant, which is the concentration of nitrogen in the iron at a given pressure of 1 atm.

To find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen, we need to substitute K[N] with the expression we obtained earlier:

[h_N] = [wt.%N] / 10^(518/T + 1.063)

[h_N] = [wt.%N] / 10^(-2.683) ≈ 0.037 wt.%N

The volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed [in $(𝑚^(3).𝑠^(−1)).𝑚^(−2)$ , rounded off to the nearest integer] is;"To solve this problem, we need to use Darcy's law to find the permeability of the granular zone. Darcy's law states that the pressure drop (ΔP) across a medium is proportional to the permeability (k) and the flow rate (Q), and inversely proportional to the bed height (H):

ΔP = -k \* Q / H

We are given that the pressure drop (ΔP) is 300 mm of water per meter of bed height, and we need to find the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area (Q) through the bed.

First, we need to convert the pressure drop from mm to Pa:

ΔP = 300 mm * 1000 Pa/mm = 300,000 Pa/m

Next, we need to find the permeability (k) of the granular zone. The permeability is given as 0.8 m^4/N/s^(-1). However, the permeability should be in units of m^2, so we need to convert:

k = 0.8 m^4/N/s^(-1) * (1 m^2 / (1 m / (10^2 s)^(-1))) = 0.08 m^2

Now, we can plug in the values we have found:

ΔP = -k \* Q / H
300,000 Pa/m = -0.08 m^2 * Q / 1 m

Next, we need to get Q alone. We can do this by rearranging the equation:

Q = -ΔP / k
Q = -300,000 Pa/m / 0.08 m^2 = -3,750 m^3/s/m^2

The volume of the blast furnace top gas [in $m^3$ (NTP), rounded off to the nearest integer] is;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The molar volume of the gas at NTP is given as 22.4 liters. Since the gas is assumed to behave ideally, we can use the ideal gas equation to relate the volume of the gas to the number of moles of gas:

V = nRT/P

where V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and P is the pressure.

Rearranging the equation to solve for n, we get:

n = V/PRT

2. The blast furnace top gas is a mixture of CO, CO2, and N2. The volume of the gas is given as 22% CO, 18% CO2, and balance N2. We can assume that the volume of the gas is proportional to the number of moles of each component.

Let's assume that the volume of the gas is 1000 liters (since we're asked to round off to the nearest integer). Then, the number of moles of each component can be calculated as:

n_CO = 0.22 x 1000 liters = 220 moles
n_CO2 = 0.18 x 1000 liters = 180 moles
n_N2 = 1000 liters - 220 liters - 180 liters = 600 moles

3. The volume of the gas is given as 22.4 liters at NTP. We can use the ideal gas equation to calculate the number of moles of gas at NTP:

n_NTP = V_NTP/P_NTPRT_NTP

where V_NTP is the volume at NTP, P_NTP is the pressure at NTP, and T_NTP is the temperature at NTP.

Rearranging the equation to solve for n_NTP, we get:

n_NTP = V_NTP/P_NTPRT_NTP

Substituting the values, we get:

n_NTP = 22.4 liters / (1 atm x 0.08206 L atm/mol K x 273 K) = 0.082 mol

4. The volume of the gas at NTP is proportional to the number of moles of gas. Therefore, the volume of the gas at NTP is:

V_NTP = n_NTP x 22.4 liters/mol = 0.082 mol x 22.4 liters/mol = 1.83 liters

5. The volume of the gas in the blast furnace top gas is 1000 liters. We can calculate the volume of the gas in the blast furnace top gas at NTP as:

V_NTP = (1000 liters x 22% CO) + (1000 liters x 18% CO2) + (1000 liters x 60% N2)

V_NTP = 220 liters + 180 liters + 600 liters = 1000 liters

The minimum current rating (Ampere per month per cell, rounded off to the nearest integer) is?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total amount of copper in the concentrate:

Weight of copper concentrate = 100 metric tons
Weight percentage of copper = 21%

Total weight of copper = (100 x 21) / 100 = 21 metric tons

2. Next, we need to find the number of grams of copper:

1 metric ton = 1000 kg = 1000000 grams
21 metric tons = 21 x 1000000 grams = 21000000 grams

3. Now, we need to find the number of grams of copper per equivalent weight:

Faraday constant = 96500 coulombs per gram-equivalent
Atomic weight of copper = 63.100 g/mol

Number of electrons required to deposit 1 mole of copper = 1
Number of coulombs required to deposit 1 mole of copper = 96500 C

Number of grams of copper per equivalent weight = 63.100 g/mol = 63.100 g/C

4. Now, we need to find the total number of grams of copper to be processed:

Time = 6 months = 6 x 25 x 8 = 1200 hours
Total number of grams of copper = 21000000 grams

5. Next, we need to find the minimum current rating:

Number of cells = 10
Total number of coulombs required to process 21000000 grams of copper = 21000000 x 63.100 / 96500 = 1432000 C

Current rating per cell = Total number of coulombs / (Number of cells x Time in hours)

1. The material is made up of alternating layers of metals A and B.

The maximum possible reduction (in 𝑚𝑚, rounded off to one decimal place) of a 100 mm thick slab during rolling is;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The coefficient of friction (μ) between the roll and the slab is given as 0.2.
2. The roll diameter is 200 mm.
3. The slab is 100 mm thick initially.
4. We need to find the maximum possible reduction in the slab thickness during rolling.

The maximum possible reduction in thickness can be calculated using the formula:

Δt = μ \* r

where Δt is the maximum possible reduction in thickness, μ is the coefficient of friction, and r is the radius of the roll.

Given the roll diameter is 200 mm, the radius of the roll (r) is:

r = 200 mm / 2 = 100 mm

Now, plug in the values:

Δt = 0.2 \* 100 mm = 20 mm

So, the maximum possible reduction in the slab thickness during rolling is 20 mm.

If the heat transfer efficiency is 0.6, the energy input per unit length (in 𝐽. $𝑚𝑚^(−1)$ , rounded off to the nearest integer) during the process is;"To solve this question, we need to calculate the energy input per unit length during the arc welding process.

Given:

* Arc welding current (I) = 400 A
* Arc welding voltage (V) = 20 V
* Traverse speed (v) = 5 mm/s

Energy input per unit length (E) can be calculated using the following formula:

E = I x V / v

First, we need to convert the traverse speed from mm/s to m/s:

v (in m/s) = 5 mm/s x (1 m / 1000 mm) = 0.005 m/s

Now, we can calculate E:

E = (400 A) x (20 V) / (0.005 m/s) = 1,600,000 J/m

Since the heat transfer efficiency is given as 0.6, the effective energy input per unit length would be:

E_eff = E x heat transfer efficiency
= 1,600,000 J/m x 0.6
= 960,000 J/m

According to Buckingham Π theorem, the number of independent dimensionless variables needed to describe the phenomenon is?  (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 5;"A classic problem!

To solve this, we can use the Buckingham Π theorem, which states that the number of independent dimensionless variables needed to describe a physical phenomenon is equal to the number of variables minus the number of fundamental dimensions.

The variables are: U (terminal rise velocity), d (diameter of the solid), W (apparent weight of the solid), µ (viscosity of the liquid), ρ (density of the liquid).

The fundamental dimensions are: L (length), M (mass), T (time).

We can express each variable in terms of these fundamental dimensions:

* U: [L/T]
* d: [L]
* W: [M]
* µ: [M/LT]
* ρ: [M/L^3]

Now, we can form dimensionless groups using the Buckingham Π theorem. Since we have 5 variables and 3 fundamental dimensions, we need to create 2 dimensionless groups (Pi terms). These are:

1. U/ρd² (velocity in terms of length, time, and mass)
2. WD/µ (weight in terms of force, length, and time)

(A) is incorrect because a heavily cold-worked metal is more likely to produce a finer recrystallized grain size due to the refinement of the grain structure through cold working.

(B) is incorrect because a higher driving force for recrystallization would actually occur due to the buildup of defects and strain energy in the cold-worked metal.

(C) is incorrect because a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains would make it more difficult for nucleation to occur, which is opposite of what would be expected for cold-worked metals.

σ_max = (K_1c / √πa) / (1 - a/2W)

where σ_max is the maximum allowed tensile stress, K_1c is the fracture toughness, a is the crack size, and W is the component width.

We are given that the fracture toughness K_1c = 30 MPa√m, and we want to find the maximum allowed tensile stress for a crack size of 1 mm = 0.001 m.

E = E° - (RT/F) \* ln(Q)

where Q is the reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants.

In this case, the cell reaction is:

Zn(s) + Fe^(+2)(aq) → Zn^(+2)(aq) + Fe(s)

The standard potential (E°) is the sum of the standard potentials of the two half-reactions:

E° = E°_(Zn^(+2)/Zn) + E°_(Fe^(+2)/Fe) = -0.76 V + (-0.44 V) = -1.20 V

The cell potential (E) is given as 0.5 V, so we can set up the Nernst equation:

0.5 V = -1.20 V - (RT/F) \* ln(Q)

Rearranging the equation to solve for Q, we get:

Q = exp((1.20 V + 0.5 V) \* (F/RT))

Using the given values of R, F, and T, we can calculate Q:

Q = exp((1.70 V \* 96500 C/mol) / (8.314 J/mol \* K \* 298 K)) ≈ 1.45 \* 10^(-5)

The reaction quotient (Q) is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants. In this case, the products are Zn^(+2) and Fe, and the reactants are Zn and Fe^(+2). Since the cell discharges spontaneously, the concentration of Zn^(+2) ions will increase, and the concentration of Fe^(+2) ions will decrease.

Let's assume that the initial concentration of Fe^(+2) ions is [Fe^(+2)]_0, and the initial concentration of Zn^(+2) ions is [Zn^(+2)]_0. Then, the reaction quotient (Q) can be written as:

Q = ([Zn^(+2)] / [Fe^(+2)]_0)

Substituting the value of Q, we get:

([Zn^(+2)] / [Fe^(+2)]_0) ≈ 1.45 \* 10^(-5)

To find the ratio of the concentrations of Fe^(+2) to Zn^(+2) ions, we can take the reciprocal of Q:

([Fe^(+2)] / [Zn^(+2)]) ≈ 1 / (1.45 \* 10^(-5)) ≈ 6.9 \* 10^4

(A) 0.185 (B) 0.262 (C) 0.320 (D) 0.370;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation:

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, d is the distance between the planes of atoms in the crystal, and θ is the Bragg angle.

We are given that the wavelength of the X-ray is 0.1543 nm, and the Bragg angle is 24.65°. We can rearrange the Bragg equation to solve for d:

d = λ / (2sinθ)

First, we need to convert the Bragg angle from degrees to radians:

θ = 24.65° × (π/180) = 0.4304 radians

Now we can plug in the values:

d = 0.1543 nm / (2sin(0.4304)) = 0.320 nm

Since the metal has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, the lattice parameter (a) is equal to the distance between the planes of atoms. Therefore, the lattice parameter is:

The Mg-Sn phase diagram exhibits two eutectics on either side of the high melting intermetallic line compound, $Mg_2Sn$, as given below.  At 561° C:  L(36.9 wt.% Sn) → α(14.48 wt.% Sn) + $Mg_2Sn$. At 203° C: L (97.87 wt.% Sn) → β-Sn (almost 100 wt.% Sn) + $Mg_2Sn$ After the eutectic reaction has gone to completion and equilibrium has been attained at a temperature just below 561° C, the amount(in wt.%) of eutectic constituent present in the alloy, Mg-50 wt.% Sn, is approximately?  (A) 25 (B) 38 (C) 62 (D) 75;"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy Mg-50 wt.% Sn at a temperature just below 561°C.

From the given phase diagram, we know that at 561°C, the eutectic reaction L(36.9 wt.% Sn) → α(14.48 wt.% Sn) + Mg2Sn occurs. This means that the eutectic composition is 36.9 wt.% Sn.

We are given that the alloy is Mg-50 wt.% Sn, which means it has a higher Sn content than the eutectic composition. Therefore, the alloy will not be in the eutectic region at 561°C.

However, we are asked to find the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy at a temperature just below 561°C. This means we need to find the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy at a temperature where the eutectic reaction is still occurring.

From the phase diagram, we know that the eutectic reaction L(36.9 wt.% Sn) → α(14.48 wt.% Sn) + Mg2Sn occurs at 561°C. As we decrease the temperature, the eutectic composition will shift towards the β-Sn side. Therefore, at a temperature just below 561°C, the eutectic composition will be closer to the β-Sn side.

Let's assume that the eutectic composition at a temperature just below 561°C is x wt.% Sn. Since the eutectic composition is closer to the β-Sn side, x will be greater than 36.9 wt.% Sn.

We know that the eutectic reaction L(x wt.% Sn) → α(14.48 wt.% Sn) + Mg2Sn occurs at this temperature. Since the alloy is Mg-50 wt.% Sn, it will react with the eutectic constituent to form α(14.48 wt.% Sn) and Mg2Sn.

Let's say the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy is y wt.%. Then, the amount of α(14.48 wt.% Sn) present in the alloy will be (50 - y) wt.%.

We know that the total amount of Sn present in the alloy is 50 wt.%. Therefore, the amount of Sn present in the eutectic constituent is y wt.% Sn, and the amount of Sn present in α(14.48 wt.% Sn) is (50 - y) wt.% Sn.

Since the eutectic reaction is in equilibrium, the amount of Sn present in the eutectic constituent is equal to the amount of Sn present in α(14.48 wt.% Sn). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

y wt.% Sn = (50 - y) wt.% Sn

Solving for y, we get:

y = 25 wt.%

Assertion [a]: Low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often have additions of strong carbide-forming elements.

Reason [r]: During creep deformation, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix, lose coherency.

The correct answer is:

(A) Both [a] and [r] are true and [r] is the correct reason for [a].

Here's why:

* Low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often do have additions of strong carbide-forming elements, such as chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten, which form carbides that can improve creep resistance. This is because carbides have a higher melting point and are more resistant to deformation than the matrix material.
* The reason for this is that during creep deformation, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix, such as carbides, can lose coherency, which means they can detach from the matrix and move freely, reducing the stress concentration and improving creep resistance.

Reason (r): Atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries.

The correct answer is (B) Both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a].

Here's why:

* Assertion (a) is true. In a dilute substitutional solid solution, the rate of homogenization is indeed controlled by the diffusivity of the solute (B) atoms. This is because the solute atoms need to diffuse through the lattice to achieve uniform distribution.
* Reason (r) is also true. Atomic migration (diffusion) in solids can occur through various mechanisms, including lattice diffusion, grain boundary diffusion, and dislocation pipe diffusion. However, in the context of homogenization, the primary mechanism is lattice diffusion, not dislocation or grain boundary diffusion.

Radius(in nm) of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice is?(round off to three decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the radius of the octahedral void in BCC iron.

In a BCC lattice, the distance between two adjacent atoms is given by:

d = 2r

where r is the radius of the Fe atom.

Given that the radius of the Fe atom is 0.124 nm, we can calculate the distance between two adjacent atoms:

d = 2(0.124 nm) = 0.248 nm

The radius of the octahedral void is half of the distance between two adjacent atoms:

r_octahedral_void = d/2 = 0.248 nm / 2 = 0.124 nm

Now, we need to find the radius of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in the octahedral void without distorting the lattice. This is given by:

r_interstitial_atom = r_octahedral_void - r_Fe

Substituting the values, we get:

r_interstitial_atom = 0.124 nm - 0.124 nm = 0.000 nm

However, this is not a valid answer, as the radius of the interstitial atom cannot be zero. This means that the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in the octahedral void without distorting the lattice has a radius of zero, which is not a physical possibility.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Note: The hard sphere model assumes that the atoms are hard spheres that cannot overlap. In reality, atoms are not hard spheres, and they can overlap to some extent.

Iron is corroding in fresh water which has dissolved oxygen concentration of 15mM. The anodic current density(in $A.cm^(-2)$) at an overpotential of 120 mV is?(round off to three decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the Tafel equation, which relates the anodic current density (j) to the overpotential (η) and the exchange current density (j0).

The Tafel equation is:

j = j0 * exp(η / η0)

where η0 is the Tafel slope, which is given as 0.06 V.

The exchange current density (j0) can be found using the Butler-Volmer equation:

j0 = F * K * e^(-Ea / RT) * sqrt(c0 / R)

where F is the Faraday constant, K is the electrochemical rate constant, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and c0 is the concentration of the oxidizing agent.

However, since we are given the diffusion coefficient (D) of oxygen, we can use the Levich equation to estimate the exchange current density (j0):

j0 = (n * F * D * c0 * sqrt(2RT / M)) / (δ * exp(η / η0))

where n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule, M is the molecular weight of oxygen, and δ is the thickness of the diffusion layer.

Rearranging the equation to solve for j0, we get:

j0 = (n * F * D * c0 * sqrt(2RT / M)) / (δ * exp(η / η0))

Substituting the given values, we get:

j0 = (1 * 96,485 * 2.42* 10^(-5) * 15 * 10^(-3) * sqrt(2 * 8.314 * 293 / 32)) / (0.06 * exp(0.12 / 0.06))

j0 ≈ 4.13 A/cm^2

Now, we can find the anodic current density (j) using the Tafel equation:

j = j0 * exp(η / η0)

j ≈ 4.13 * exp(0.12 / 0.06)

j ≈ 14.47 A/cm^2

Time taken(in seconds) for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is?(round off to two decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the equation for the growth of an oxide film, which is given by:

thickness (t) = K \* time (t)^(1/2)

where K is the parabolic rate constant.

Given values:
density of oxide = 6.5 g/cm^3
parabolic rate constant = 3 * 10^(-6) g^2/cm^4 s^(-1)
thickness = 2 µm = 0.002 cm

First, we need to convert the parabolic rate constant to a value that corresponds to the given density. We can do this by rearranging the definition of molarity:

density (ρ) = M / V

where M is the molecular weight of the oxide and V is the volume of the oxide film.

density = 6.5 g/cm^3
molecular weight of oxide = ?
volume of oxide film = thickness * area

Let's use the given density and assume a specific area of the oxide film (e.g. 1 cm^2). Then, we can calculate the volume of the oxide film:

volume = thickness * area = 0.002 cm * 1 cm^2 = 0.002 cm^3

Now, we can use the above equation to solve for the molecular weight of the oxide:

density = M / V
6.5 g/cm^3 = M / 0.002 cm^3

M = (6.5 g/cm^3) * (0.002 cm^3) = 0.013 g

Now, we can convert this molecular weight to grams per square meter:

0.013 g / (0.002 cm^3) * (100 cm)^2 = 655 g/m^2

Now, we can convert this molecular weight to grams per square meter, which is a common unit for the parabolic rate constant:

parabolic rate constant = 3 * 10^(-6) g^2/cm^4 s^(-1)
= 3 * 10^(-6) g^2/(655 g/m^2)^2 s^(-1)
= 3 * 10^(-6) g^2/(0.1313 m)^2 s^(-1)

Now, we can solve for the time it takes for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm:

thickness = K * t^(1/2)
2 * 10^(-6) = 3 * 10^(-6) * t^(1/2)

Solve for t:

t = (2 * 10^(-6)) / (3 * 10^(-6))^(1/2)

Contribution to dilution of the weld pool is 20% from each plate. The Ni content(in wt.%) in the weld pool is?(round off to the nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of dilution in welding. Since the weld pool is a mixture of the two parent plates and the filler rod, we need to calculate the contribution of each component to the mixture.

Let's calculate the amount of Fe-10wt.% Ni from Plate 1:

Contribution from Plate 1: 10 wt.% Ni / (10 wt.% Ni + 90 wt.% Fe) = 10%

Similarly, calculate the amount of Fe-20wt.% Ni from Plate 2:

Contribution from Plate 2: 20 wt.% Ni / (20 wt.% Ni + 80 wt.% Fe) = 20%

Now, calculate the total contribution from both plates:

Total Contribution = 10% + 20% = 30%

Since the weld pool also contains the filler rod, which is 20wt.% Ni - 80wt.% Cr, we need to subtract its contribution from the total:

Total Contribution from filler rod = 80% (since 20wt.% Ni / (20wt.% Ni + 80wt.% Cr) = 20%)

So, the net total contribution from the plates is:

30% - 20% = 10%

Now, we can calculate the Ni content in the weld pool by subtracting the filler rod contribution from the total:

Ni content in weld pool = 10 wt.% Ni (from Plates) + 20 wt.% Ni (from filler rod) = 30 wt.%

The enthalpy of melting (ΔHm) is given as 13 kJ/mol. Since the temperature is below the melting point, the system is undergoing a spontaneous process, and the enthalpy change is negative.

At 1353 K, the temperature is 3 K below the melting point, so we can use the following approximation:

ΔH = ΔHm \* (Tm - T) / Tm

where Tm is the melting temperature (1356 K) and T is the temperature at which the transformation is occurring (1353 K).

Plugging in the values, we get:

ΔH = 13 kJ/mol \* (1356 K - 1353 K) / 1356 K ≈ 0.9 kJ/mol

4. 1000 kg of liquid steel containing 0.03 wt.% S needs to be desulphurized to bring the sulphur content down to 0.015 wt.%.
5. The goal is to find the quantity of slag needed.

Let's start by calculating the amount of sulphur in the steel:

Initial sulphur content in steel = 0.03 wt.%
Mass of steel = 1000 kg

Amount of sulphur in steel = 0.03 wt.% × 1000 kg = 30 g

After desulphurization, the sulphur content in steel needs to be 0.015 wt.%:

Desired sulphur content in steel = 0.015 wt.%
Mass of steel = 1000 kg

Amount of sulphur in steel after desulphurization = 0.015 wt.% × 1000 kg = 15 g

Since the sulphur partition ratio is 50, the amount of sulphur in the slag will be half of the amount of sulphur removed from the steel:

Amount of sulphur in slag = (30 g - 15 g) / 2 = 7.5 g

Now, let's calculate the mass of slag needed:

Mass of slag = Amount of sulphur in slag / (Sulphur partition ratio × Sulphur content in steel after desulphurization)
= 7.5 g / (50 × 0.015)
= 10 kg

= 4.55 * 10^27 Si atoms

Since the zone refining process has a residual P content of 0.1 parts per billion by weight, we can calculate the number of phosphorus (P) atoms:

Number of P atoms = Number of Si atoms x (Residual P content / Total weight of Si)
= 4.55 * 10^27 Si atoms x (0.1 parts per billion / 28.09 g)

We can simplify this proportion by dividing both sides by the creep rate at 890 K:

Creep rate at 980 K = 20 × Creep rate at 890 K

Now, let's say the creep rate at x K is 5 times the creep rate at 890 K. We can set up another proportion:

Creep rate at x K / Creep rate at 890 K = 5

We can simplify this proportion by dividing both sides by the creep rate at 890 K:

Creep rate at x K = 5 × Creep rate at 890 K

Notice that the creep rate at x K is also proportional to the creep rate at 980 K. We can set up a proportion to relate the creep rates at x K and 980 K:

Creep rate at x K / Creep rate at 980 K =?

We know that the creep rate at 980 K is 20 times the creep rate at 890 K, so:

Creep rate at 980 K = 20 × Creep rate at 890 K

We can substitute this expression into the previous proportion:

Creep rate at x K / (20 × Creep rate at 890 K) =?

Now, we can simplify this proportion by dividing both sides by the creep rate at 890 K:

Creep rate at x K / Creep rate at 890 K = 1/20

This means that the creep rate at x K is 1/20 of the creep rate at 980 K. Since the creep rate at 980 K is 20 times the creep rate at 890 K, we can find x by multiplying 890 K by a factor of 1/20:

x = 890 K × (1/20) = 44.5 K

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get:

x = 45 K

So, the correct answer is:

The crack growth rate is related to the stress intensity range, ΔK as da/dN ∝ $(ΔK)^(3)$, where, a is the crack lenght and N is the number of cycles. When the crack length increases by a factor of two, the crack growth rate will increase by a factor of?(round off to one decimal place).;"To solve this problem, we can use the given relationship between crack growth rate and stress intensity range:

da/dN  (ΔK)³

We are told that the crack length increases by a factor of two, which means that the stress intensity range, ΔK, also increases by a factor of two (since ΔK is proportional to the crack length).

Let's denote the initial crack length and stress intensity range as a0 and ΔK0, respectively. Then, the new crack length and stress intensity range are 2a0 and 2ΔK0, respectively.

The crack growth rate is proportional to the cube of the stress intensity range, so:

Since the crack growth rate is proportional to the cube of the stress intensity range, when the crack length increases by a factor of two, the crack growth rate increases by a factor of:

Fluid Mechanics;8;G-META-20-53;NUM;80;Given: 1. Acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 $m.s^(-2)$. Cross-sectional area of gate is 0.2 $m^2$. In a top gated mold, liquid metal enters the mold cavity as freely falling stream under gravity from a height of 0.5m. Ignore the fluid friction due to viscosity and the drag due to changes in the direction of flow. If the volume of the mold cavity is 10 $m^3$, then the time(in seconds) required to fill the mold is?(roound off to nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we need to find the time taken to fill the mold cavity. We can do this by using the equation:

Volume of the mold cavity = Area of the gate x Time x Velocity

Given:
Volume of the mold cavity = 10 m^3
Area of the gate = 0.2 m^2
Height of the metal stream entering the mold = 0.5 m
Acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s^2

First, we need to find the velocity of the metal stream:

Velocity = √(2 x Acceleration due to gravity x Height)
= √(2 x 9.8 x 0.5)
= √4.9
= 2.2 m/s

Now we can rearrange the equation to solve for time:

Time = Volume of the mold cavity / (Area of the gate x Velocity)
= 10 / (0.2 x 2.2)
= 2.5 seconds

R = 8.314 $J.mol^(-1).K^(-1)$. Assume: 1. Equilibrium between dissolved carbon [C], dissolved oxygen [O], and CO (gas) at 1 atmpshere. 2.Henry's law is valid for both [C] and [O]. A basic oxygen furnace operator, at the end of oxygen blow, measures the dissolved oxygen content in the steel as 0.03 wt.% and the steel temperature as 1800K. The carbon content [C] in the steel is?(round off to two decimal places);"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given reaction: [C] + [O] → CO

ΔG° = -19840 - 40.65T J

We are given the temperature (T) as 1800 K.

ΔG° = -19840 - 40.65(1800) J
= -19840 - 73400 J
= -93140 J

Since the reaction is at equilibrium, ΔG = 0.

0 = -93140 - RT ln(Q)

where Q is the reaction quotient.

Q = [CO] / ([C][O])

We are given the dissolved oxygen content as 0.03 wt.% and the steel temperature as 1800 K. We can use Henry's law to relate the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) to its concentration:

PO2 = k[O]

where k is the Henry's law constant.

At 1800 K, the Henry's law constant for oxygen is approximately 2.45 × 10^5 Pa·mol/L.

PO2 = 2.45 × 10^5 × 0.03
= 7.35 × 10^3 Pa

The total pressure is 1 atm = 1.013 × 10^5 Pa. Therefore, the mole fraction of oxygen in the gas phase is:

xO2 = PO2 / Ptotal
= 7.35 × 10^3 / (1.013 × 10^5)
= 0.0073

The reaction quotient Q is:

Q = (xO2) / ([C][O])
= (0.0073) / ([C](0.03))

We can now solve for [C]:

[C] = (0.0073) / (0.03)
= 0.243

The carbon content [C] in the steel is approximately 0.24 wt.%.

Material Manufacturing;54;G-META-20-6;MCQS;46;Which one of the following statements regarding selective leaching of a binary alloy is TRUE?  (A) The lower atomic weight element is leached (B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached (C) The more electronegative element is leached (D) The element with lower density is leached;"The correct answer is:

(B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached

Explanation:

Selective leaching is a process where one element in a binary alloy is preferentially removed or leached, leaving the other element behind. In a binary alloy, the element with higher diffusivity (i.e., the ability to move through the alloy) is more likely to be leached, as it can more easily escape from the alloy and be removed. This is because the element with higher diffusivity has a greater tendency to migrate to the surface of the alloy and be removed by external factors such as corrosion or chemical reactions.

The other options are incorrect:

(A) The lower atomic weight element is not necessarily the one that is leached. In some cases, the higher atomic weight element may be more easily leached due to its higher diffusivity.

(C) The more electronegative element is not necessarily the one that is leached. Electronegativity is a measure of an element's ability to attract electrons, and it is not directly related to its diffusivity or tendency to be leached.

(D) The element with lower density is not necessarily the one that is leached. Density is a measure of an element's mass per unit volume, and it is not directly related to its diffusivity or tendency to be leached.

(B) High strain-rate sensitivity

Superplasticity is a property of certain materials that allows them to be deformed at high temperatures and high strain rates without significant hardening or necking. One of the requirements for a material to exhibit superplasticity is that it must have a high strain-rate sensitivity, which means that the material's flow stress increases rapidly with increasing strain rate. This allows the material to maintain its ability to deform plastically at high strain rates, which is necessary for superplastic behavior.

The other options are not correct:

(A) A coarse-grained microstructure can actually hinder superplasticity, as it can lead to the formation of large grains that are prone to cracking and fragmentation.

(C) A low strain-hardening exponent is not a requirement for superplasticity. In fact, some superplastic materials may exhibit a high strain-hardening exponent, which can help to maintain their ability to deform plastically.

(D) The modulus of elasticity is not directly related to superplasticity. While a high modulus of elasticity may be beneficial for some materials, it is not a requirement for superplastic behavior.

(A) Oil> Water> Brine> Air (B) Brine> Oil> Water> Air (C) Brine> Water> Oil> Air (D) Water> Brine> Oil> Air;"To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of quenching power and the properties of different quenchants.

Quenching power refers to the ability of a quenchant to rapidly cool a hot metal surface, thereby reducing the risk of distortion and cracking. The quenching power of a quenchant depends on its thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density.

Here's a brief overview of the quenchants mentioned in the options:

* Air: Air is a poor conductor of heat and has a low specific heat capacity, making it a weak quenchant.
* Water: Water is a better conductor of heat than air, but its specific heat capacity is still relatively low. It is a moderate quenchant.
* Brine: Brine (a solution of water and salt) has a higher thermal conductivity than water and a higher specific heat capacity than air. It is a stronger quenchant than water.
* Oil: Oil is a good conductor of heat and has a high specific heat capacity, making it a strong quenchant.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

* (A) Oil > Water > Brine > Air: This is the correct sequence. Oil has the highest quenching power, followed by water, then brine, and finally air.
* (B) Brine > Oil > Water > Air: This is incorrect. Oil has a higher quenching power than brine.
* (C) Brine > Water > Oil > Air: This is incorrect. Oil has a higher quenching power than water.
* (D) Water > Brine > Oil > Air: This is incorrect. Brine has a higher quenching power than water, and oil has a higher quenching power than brine.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is expected to be?(round off to nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the symmetric distribution and the z-score formula.

The z-score formula is:

z = (X - μ) / σ

where X is the value of the random variable, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

We are given that the probability P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98, which means that 98% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.

We can set up an equation using the z-score formula:

z = (5 + 2(0.5)) / 0.5

z = 4

This means that 98% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean, which is 4 standard deviations from the mean.

To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm, we need to find the area between the mean and 6 µm.

The area between the mean and 6 µm is equal to the area under the curve to the right of the mean and to the left of 6 µm.

Using the z-score formula, we can find the z-score corresponding to 6 µm:

z = (6 - 5) / 0.5

z = 2

This means that 6 µm is 2 standard deviations above the mean.

The area under the curve to the right of the mean and to the left of 6 µm is equal to the area under the curve between z = 0 and z = 2.

Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the area under the curve between z = 0 and z = 2:

Area = 0.4772

This means that approximately 47.72% of the data points fall within the range 5 to 6 µm.

μ°(Ni+2) = E°(Ni+/Ni) + RT/F

where μ°(Ni+2) is the standard chemical potential of Ni+2, E°(Ni+/Ni) is the standard electrode potential for the reaction Ni → Ni+, and R and F are the gas constant and Faraday's constant, respectively.

Given values:

F = 96500 C mol⁻¹
E°(Ni+/Ni) = -0.25 V

We can substitute these values into the formula:

μ°(Ni+2) = (-0.25 V) + (8.314 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹) (288.15 K) / (96500 C mol⁻¹)

First, let's calculate the term inside the parentheses:

(8.314 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹) (288.15 K) = 2394.7 J/mol
= 2.3947 kJ/mol

Now, we can substitute this value back into the original equation:

μ°(Ni+2) = (-0.25 V) + (2.3947 kJ/mol) / (96500 C mol⁻¹)
= (-0.25 V) + 0.0248 V
= -0.2252 V

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔG is the free energy change, ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change.

We are given that the enthalpy of melting (ΔH) is 13400 J/mol, and the melting point (T) is 1358 K. We are also given that the temperature at which we want to calculate the free energy change is 1058 K.

First, we need to calculate the entropy change (ΔS) using the following equation:

ΔS = ΔH / T

Plugging in the values, we get:

ΔS = 13400 J/mol / 1358 K = 9.85 J/mol·K

Now, we can calculate the free energy change (ΔG) using the equation above:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

Rc = 2γ / (ΔGv)

where Rc is the critical radius, γ is the surface energy, and ΔGv is the change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume.

If the surface energy increases by 20%, the new surface energy can be written as:

γ' = γ + 0.20γ = 1.20γ

The new critical radius can be written as:

Rc' = 2γ' / (ΔGv)

Substituting the expression for γ', we get:

Rc' = 2(1.20γ) / (ΔGv) = 2.40γ / (ΔGv)

The percentage increase in the critical radius can be calculated as:

((Rc' - Rc) / Rc) × 100%

Substituting the expressions for Rc and Rc', we get:

((2.40γ / (ΔGv) - 2γ / (ΔGv)) / (2γ / (ΔGv))) × 100%

We can also use the fact that the lattice parameter of iron at room temperature is 0.287 nm.

The magnetic moment per iron atom in the crystal is given by:

µ = M × (a^3)

Where:
µ = magnetic moment per iron atom in the crystal
M = saturation magnetization of iron (kAm-1)
a = lattice parameter (nm)

Since the distance between the planes is the same for both reflections, we can set up the equation:

A 0.6 wt.% C steel sample is slowly cooled from 900°C to room temperature. The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is?(round off to 2 decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we need to determine the sequence of phase transformations that occur in the steel as it cools from 900°C to room temperature.

1. Initially, the steel is in the austenitic phase (γ-Fe) at 900°C, with a composition of 0.6 wt.% C.
2. As the steel cools, the austenite starts to transform into ferrite (α-Fe) and cementite (Fe3C) through the eutectoid reaction:

γ-Fe (0.6 wt.% C) → α-Fe + Fe3C

The eutectoid composition is 0.8 wt.% C, which is higher than the composition of the steel (0.6 wt.% C). Therefore, the steel will not undergo a eutectoid transformation.

3. As the steel continues to cool, the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe (0.025 wt.% C) is exceeded, and proeutectoid ferrite starts to form. The amount of proeutectoid ferrite that forms is determined by the amount of carbon that is rejected from the austenite as it transforms into ferrite.

The amount of carbon rejected from the austenite can be calculated using the following equation:

ΔC = C0 - 0.025

where ΔC is the amount of carbon rejected, C0 is the initial carbon content (0.6 wt.% C), and 0.025 is the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe.

ΔC = 0.6 - 0.025 = 0.575 wt.% C

The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite that forms can be calculated using the following equation:

f = ΔC / C0

f = 0.575 / 0.6 = 0.9583

Therefore, the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is approximately 0.96 or 96%.

1. The molecular formula of polyethylene is (CH2)n, where n is the degree of polymerization.
2. Given that the degree of polymerization is 30,000, the molecular formula becomes (CH2)30000.
3. The molecular weight of polyethylene can be calculated by multiplying the atomic weights of carbon and hydrogen by their respective numbers in the molecular formula:

Molecular weight = (12 g/mol x 30000) + (1 g/mol x 60000)
= 360,000 g/mol + 60,000 g/mol

We are given that the vacancy concentration doubles when the temperature increases from 27°C to 127°C. This means that the Gibbs free energy of vacancy formation decreases by ΔG = RT ln(2), where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are also given that ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Since ΔG is proportional to T, we can write:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = RT ln(2)

Rearranging this equation to solve for ΔH, we get:

ΔH = RT ln(2) + TΔS

We are given that R = 8.314 J/mol·K and that the temperature increases from 27°C to 127°C. We can convert the temperatures to Kelvin:

T2 = 127°C + 273.15 = 400.15 K

The change in temperature is ΔT = T2 - T1 = 100 K.

Substituting the values into the equation, we get:

ΔH = (8.314 J/mol·K) × 100 K × ln(2) + (400.15 K) × ΔS

To solve for ΔH, we need to know the value of ΔS. Unfortunately, ΔS is not given in the problem. However, we can use the fact that ΔG is proportional to T to estimate the value of ΔS.

Since ΔG is proportional to T, we can write:

ΔG  T

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔG  400.15 K

Since ΔG is proportional to T, we can write:

ΔG = kT

where k is a constant. Rearranging this equation to solve for k, we get:

k = ΔG / T

Substituting the values, we get:

k = (ΔG) / 400.15 K

Now, we can use the fact that ΔG = RT ln(2) to solve for k:

k = (8.314 J/mol·K) × 100 K × ln(2) / 400.15 K

Simplifying the equation, we get:

k = 1.386 J/mol

Now, we can use the value of k to estimate the value of ΔS:

ΔS = ΔG / T

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔS = (1.386 J/mol) / 400.15 K

Simplifying the equation, we get:

ΔS = 0.00347 J/mol·K

Now, we can use the value of ΔS to solve for ΔH:

ΔH = RT ln(2) + TΔS

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔH = (8.314 J/mol·K) × 100 K × ln(2) + (400.15 K) × 0.00347 J/mol·K

Simplifying the equation, we get:

ΔH = 12.42 kJ/mol

(D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation;"Let's analyze the options:

(A) An oversized solute atom would preferentially migrate below the slip plane of an edge dislocation: This is TRUE. Oversized solute atoms tend to migrate to regions of lower stress, which is the compressive region below the slip plane of an edge dislocation.

(B) A spherically symmetric point defect can interact with both the hydrostatic and shear stress fields of a dislocation: This is TRUE. Spherically symmetric point defects, such as vacancies, can interact with both the hydrostatic (normal) and shear stress fields of a dislocation.

(A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1) (B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1) (C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1) (D) [0 1 1](1 1 -1);"To solve this problem, we need to find the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) on each of the possible slip systems and compare it to the applied tensile stress.

The slip systems in aluminum are:

* [1 1 1](1 1 1)
* [1 1 1](1 1 -1)
* [0 1 1](1 1 -1)

The Schmid factor for each slip system is:

* [1 1 1](1 1 1): 1/3
* [1 1 1](1 1 -1): 1/3
* [0 1 1](1 1 -1): 1/2

The resolved shear stress (RSS) on each slip system is:

* [1 1 1](1 1 1): 100 MPa \* 1/3 = 33.33 MPa
* [1 1 1](1 1 -1): 100 MPa \* 1/3 = 33.33 MPa
* [0 1 1](1 1 -1): 100 MPa \* 1/2 = 50 MPa

Since the CRSS is 25 MPa, the slip system that will be activated is the one with the highest RSS that is greater than or equal to the CRSS.

Comparing the RSS values, we see that [0 1 1](1 1 -1) has the highest RSS value (50 MPa) that is greater than or equal to the CRSS (25 MPa).

The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is:  (A) ΔPR/(2L) (B) ΔPR/L (C) 3ΔPR/(2L) (D) 2ΔPR/L;"To solve this problem, we need to find the shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall. The shear stress (τ) is given by the product of the fluid's velocity gradient and the viscosity (μ).

From the given equation for the axial velocity (vz), we can find the velocity gradient (dvz/dr) by differentiating with respect to the radial distance (r):

dvz/dr = {-ΔP/L}*({2r} / 4µ)

The shear stress is then given by:

τ = μ * dvz/dr = μ * {-ΔP/L}*({2r} / 4µ)

Now, we can plug in values at the wall (r = R) to find the maximum shear stress:

τ_max = μ * {-ΔP/L}*({2R} / 4µ)

Simplifying, we get:

τ_max = ΔP/(2L) (Option A is incorrect, but we chose this answer because the correct answer is a multiple of this)

Now, the correct answer is either B or D. To determine which one is correct, we need more information about the flow.

However, the problem statement doesn't give a boundary condition (e.g., no-slip condition at the wall), which is necessary to determine the exact shear stress distribution and find the correct answer.

Thus, the correct answer cannot be definitely determined from the given information.

A blast furnace uses hematite ore with 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. It uses 600 kg coke per ton of hot metal. The coke contains 85% C and 15%ash. The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5%C. The weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal respectively, are: (Assume that the gangue materials of the ore and ash content of coke form slag while $Fe_(2)O_3$ in the ore is consumed in making hot metal)  (A) 1705 kg, 431 kg (B) 2131kg, 546 kg (C) 1705kg, 331kg (D) 1500kg, 431kg;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The blast furnace uses 600 kg of coke per ton of hot metal. The coke contains 85% C and 15% ash. Let's calculate the weight of carbon and ash in the coke:

Weight of carbon = 600 kg x 0.85 = 510 kg
Weight of ash = 600 kg x 0.15 = 90 kg

2. The hot metal contains 95.5% Fe and 4.5% C. Let's calculate the weight of iron and carbon in the hot metal:

Weight of iron = 1000 kg x 0.955 = 955 kg
Weight of carbon = 1000 kg x 0.045 = 45 kg

3. The hematite ore contains 80% Fe2O3 and 20% gangue materials. Let's calculate the weight of iron ore used:

Weight of iron ore = 1000 kg x (weight of iron in hot metal / weight of Fe2O3 in hematite ore)

Weight of Fe2O3 in hematite ore = 1000 kg x (0.955 / 0.8) = 1194.375 kg

Weight of iron ore = 1000 kg x (1194.375 / 0.8) = 1499.688 kg

4. The slag produced contains the gangue materials from the ore and the ash from the coke. Let's calculate the weight of slag:

Weight of slag = weight of gangue materials in ore + weight of ash in coke
= 1000 kg x 0.2 + 90 kg
= 200 kg + 90 kg
= 290 kg

5. Finally, let's calculate the weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal:

Weight of iron ore used = 1499.688 kg
Weight of slag produced = 290 kg

A continous fillet weld is made using a 3000 W welding machine. At a travel speed of 6 mm $s^(-1)$, the cross-sectional area(in $mm^2$) of the weld is?(round off to nearest integer);"Given the data, we can calculate the energy required to melt the metal as:

Energy required = Heat transfer factor * Melting factor * Cross-sectional area * Unit energy required

Let's plug in the values:

Energy required = 0.6 * 0.5 * Cross-sectional area * 6 J mm⁻³

Since the energy required is constant, it must be equal to the energy transferred by the welding machine. The energy transferred can be calculated as:

Energy transferred = Power of welding machine * Time taken

We know the power of the welding machine, but we need to find the time taken. The travel speed of 6 mm/s gives us the time taken to complete a 1 mm weld:

Time taken = Length of weld / Travel speed
Time taken = 1 mm / 6 mm/s = 0.167 s (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the energy transferred:

Energy transferred = 3000 W * 0.167 s = 501 J (approximately)

Now, we can set up an equation using the energy required:

0.6 * 0.5 * Cross-sectional area * 6 J mm⁻³ = 501 J

Now, we can solve for the cross-sectional area:

Cross-sectional area = 501 J / (0.6 * 0.5 * 6) ≈ 14.5 mm²

If solidification time is 60 minutes in the spherical casting, the time(in minutes) required to solidify in the cubical casting is?(round off to nearest integer);"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The solidification time is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of the casting. This is because the surface area of the casting increases with the square of the radius, and the heat loss is proportional to the surface area.

Let's denote the solidification time in the spherical casting as t_s = 60 minutes. We can write an equation based on the above principle:

t_s  (1/r_s)^2

where r_s is the radius of the spherical casting.

Now, let's denote the solidification time in the cubical casting as t_c. We can write another equation:

t_c  (1/r_c)^2

where r_c is the edge length of the cubical casting.

Since the solidification time is proportional to the inverse square of the radius, we can set up a proportionality equation:

t_s / t_c = (r_c / r_s)^2

Substituting the values given, we get:

60 / t_c = (12/6)^2
60 / t_c = 4
t_c = 15

So, the solidification time in the cubical casting is 15 minutes.

where A0 is the initial cross-sectional area of the sample, and Af is the final cross-sectional area of the sample.

Given that the height of the sample is reduced by 60%, we can assume that the cross-sectional area is reduced by the same percentage. Therefore, Af = 0.4A0.

Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

ε = ln(A0 / 0.4A0)

4. Convert the standard Gibbs free energy change to a standard free energy change at 973 K: ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)
5. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, ΔG = 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0 = -392 kJ + RT ln(Q)
6. Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(Q): ln(Q) = -392 kJ / RT
7. Use the given value of R and the temperature to calculate the value of ln(Q): ln(Q) = -392 kJ / (8.314 J/mol·K × 973 K) ≈ -0.53

The shear stress required to bow a dislocation line is inversely proportional to the square of the dislocation line spacing. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

τ  1/d^2

where τ is the shear stress and d is the dislocation line spacing.

Given that the shear stress required to bow a dislocation line between precipitates with a spacing of 0.2 µm is 100 MPa, we can write:

Electrical Properties;34;G-META-21-52;NUM;70;Given: $β_c$ = 0.1V per decade of current density. Exchange current density of hydrogen on iron surface = $10^(-9)$ A $cm^(-2)$, R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$, F = 96500 C $mol^(-1)$. All potentials are with reference to standard hydrogen electrode. At 25°C, iron corrodes in a dearated acid of pH 3 with a corrosion current density of 4 µA $cm^(-2)$. The corrosion potential (V) is?(round off to 2 decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the Nernst equation to relate the corrosion potential to the exchange current density and corrosion current density.

First, we need to calculate the standard potential for the reaction:

Fe (iron) + 2H⁺ → Fe⁺⁺ (iron(II)) + H₂ (hydrogen gas)

This is a spontaneous reaction at standard conditions, so the standard potential is positive. The standard entropy change (∆S⁰) and standard free energy change (∆G⁰) can be calculated using thermodynamic tables or referenced values.

Next, we can set up the Nernst equation for the corrosion reaction:

Ecorr = E⁰ + (RT/nF) * ln(Icorr/I0)

where Ecorr is the corrosion potential, E⁰ is the standard potential, RT/nF is the slope of the Nernst equation, Icorr is the corrosion current density, and I0 is the exchange current density.

Given values:

β_c = 0.1 V/decade of current density = 0.1 V
Icorr = 4 µA/cm² = 4 × 10⁻⁶ A/cm²
I0 = 10³ A/cm² (exchange current density)
R = 8.314 J/mol*K
F = 96500 C/mol
T = 25°C = 298 K

First, let's calculate the slope of the Nernst equation:

RT/nF = 0.0257 V

The Nernst equation becomes:

Ecorr = E⁰ + (0.0257 / 0.1) * ln(4 × 10⁻³ / 10⁻⁹)

Simplifying and rearranging:

Ecorr ≈ 0.55 V

Round off to 2 decimal places:

Ecorr ≈ 0.55 V

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[0.55 V]

Note: The calculation assumes that the corrosion potential is measured with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).";-;-0.60 TO -0.50;0;
Atomic Structure;97;G-META-21-53;NUM;38;Assume the radius of Fe atom to be 0.124 nm. The radius of an interstitial atom which just fits(without distorting the structure) inside an octahedral void of a bcc-iron crystal (in nm) is?(round off to 3 decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the octahedral void in a bcc-iron crystal.

In a bcc lattice, the radius of the octahedral void is given by:

r_void = r_atom * √3/2

where r_atom is the radius of the iron atom.

Given the radius of the Fe atom is 0.124 nm, we can calculate the radius of the octahedral void as:

r_void = 0.124 nm * √3/2
= 0.124 nm * 1.732
= 0.214 nm

So, the radius of the interstitial atom that just fits inside the octahedral void is 0.214 nm.

Thermodynamics;88;G-META-21-54;NUM;44;Assume: Weight gain is proportional to square root of time. Nickel undergoes isothermal oxidation at 800K for a duration of 400s resulting in a weight gain of 2mg $cm^(2)$. The weight gain (mg $cm^2$) after a duration of 1600s is?(round off to nearest integer).;"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given that weight gain is proportional to the square root of time, we can write an equation:

Weight gain  √t

where t is the time in seconds.

We are given that the weight gain after 400 seconds is 2 mg/cm². Let's denote this weight gain as W1:

W1 = 2 mg/cm²

We can write an equation based on the given information:

2 = k√400

where k is the constant of proportionality.

Solving for k, we get:

k = 2 / √400 = 0.05 mg/cm² s^0.5

Now, we need to find the weight gain after 1600 seconds. We can use the equation:

Weight gain = k√t

Substituting the value of k and t, we get:

Weight gain = 0.05√1600
= 0.05 × 40
= 2 mg/cm²

So, the weight gain after 1600 seconds is 2 mg/cm².

Thermodynamics;83;G-META-21-6;MCQS;77;Given: ($ΔH_(mix)$ - Mixing enthalpy, $a_B$ - activity of B and $X_B$ - Mole fraction of B). Elements A and B have the same crystal structure. For a dilute solution of B in A, which one of the following is true?  (A) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$ (B) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ > $X_B$ (C) If $ΔH_(mix)$ > 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$ (D) If $ΔH_(mix)$ < 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$;"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the mixing enthalpy (ΔHmix) and the activity of component B (aB) in a binary solution.

For a dilute solution of B in A, the activity of B (aB) is related to its mole fraction (X_B) by the following equation:

a_B = γ_B X_B

where γ_B is the activity coefficient of B.

The mixing enthalpy (ΔHmix) is a measure of the energy change associated with mixing the two components. For a regular solution, ΔHmix is related to the activity coefficient γ_B by the following equation:

ΔHmix = RT (γ_B - 1)

where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) If ΔHmix = 0, then γ_B = 1, which means that the activity of B is equal to its mole fraction (a_B = X_B). This is not correct, as the activity coefficient is not equal to 1.

(B) If ΔHmix = 0, then γ_B = 1, which means that the activity of B is equal to its mole fraction (a_B = X_B). This is not correct, as the activity coefficient is not equal to 1.

(C) If ΔHmix > 0, then γ_B > 1, which means that the activity of B is less than its mole fraction (a_B < X_B). This is correct, as the activity coefficient is greater than 1, indicating that the component B is less soluble in the solvent A.

(D) If ΔHmix < 0, then γ_B < 1, which means that the activity of B is greater than its mole fraction (a_B > X_B). This is not correct, as the activity coefficient is less than 1, indicating that the component B is more soluble in the solvent A.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) If ΔH_(mix) > 0, then a_B < X_B";C;D;0;
Mechanical Properties;61;G-META-21-7;MCQS;65;For uniaxial tensile stress-strain behaviour of polycrystalline aluminium, which one of the following statements is FALSE?  (A) True stress is always higher than the engineerig stress. (B) At the ultimate stress point on the true stress-strain curve, dσ/dε = 0 (C) Resilience is the area under the elastic region of the engineering stress-strain curve. (D) Maximum true stress does not correspond to the maximum load.;"Let's analyze each option:

(A) True stress is always higher than the engineering stress: This is TRUE. True stress is the actual stress in the material, while engineering stress is the stress calculated based on the original cross-sectional area. Since the material is being stretched, the cross-sectional area decreases, and the true stress is higher than the engineering stress.

(B) At the ultimate stress point on the true stress-strain curve, dσ/dε = 0: This is FALSE. At the ultimate stress point, the material is about to fail, and the stress-strain curve is typically concave upwards. This means that the derivative of stress with respect to strain (dσ/dε) is actually positive, not zero.

(C) Resilience is the area under the elastic region of the engineering stress-strain curve: This is FALSE. Resilience is the area under the entire stress-strain curve, not just the elastic region. It represents the energy absorbed by the material during deformation.

(D) Maximum true stress does not correspond to the maximum load: This is TRUE. The maximum true stress occurs at the point where the material is about to fail, which is typically not the same point as the maximum load. The maximum load occurs when the material is still in the elastic region, while the maximum true stress occurs when the material is in the plastic region.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).";B;B;1;

(A) The minimum creep rate is obtained in the primary stage (stage I) (B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size (C) Coble creep occurs via grain boundary diffusion. (D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion;"Here's the solution:

* (A) The minimum creep rate is obtained in the primary stage (stage I): FALSE. The primary stage (stage I) is characterized by a rapid increase in creep rate, not a minimum creep rate.
* (B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size: FALSE. Generally, creep resistance increases with decreasing grain size due to the increased grain boundary area and the resulting increased resistance to grain boundary sliding.
* (C) Coble creep occurs via grain boundary diffusion: TRUE. Coble creep is a type of creep that occurs via grain boundary diffusion, where vacancies and atoms diffuse along the grain boundaries to accommodate the creep strain.
* (D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion: TRUE. Nabarro-Herring creep is a type of creep that occurs via lattice diffusion, where vacancies and atoms diffuse through the lattice to accommodate the creep strain.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size.";B;A;0;

Silicon is a ferrite stabilizer, which means it helps to stabilize the formation of ferrite, a type of iron oxide, in steel alloys. Ferrite is a common phase in steel that provides strength and ductility.

Here's a brief explanation of the other options:

(A) Nickel is a austenite stabilizer, which means it helps to stabilize the formation of austenite, a type of iron-carbon alloy, in steel alloys.

(B) Manganese is a deoxidizer, which means it helps to remove oxygen from the steel alloy.

A. Smelting reduction of TiO2: This method is not commonly used for producing titanium, as it is not an efficient process.

B. Thermal dissociation of TiH2: This method is not a common method for producing titanium, as titanium hydride is not a common intermediate in titanium production.

C. Reduction of TiCl4 by Mg: This method is not a common method for producing titanium, as titanium tetrachloride is not a common intermediate in titanium production.

(C) spheroidal graphite

Here's my reasoning:

* White iron is caused by high levels of silicon and is typically associated with steel production, not cast iron.
* Gray iron is a type of cast iron that has a gray appearance due to the presence of graphite, but it's not directly related to magnesium treatment.
* Malleable iron is a type of cast iron that has been treated to produce a certain microstructure, but it's not directly related to magnesium treatment either.
* Spheroidal graphite (also known as ductile iron) is a type of cast iron that has been treated with sodium and/or magnesium to produce a graphite flake structure that is more rounded and less flaky than traditional gray iron. This treatment process is often used to improve the ductility and impact resistance of the cast iron.

Copper has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which means that the atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice with atoms at the corners and the center of each face.

The X-ray diffraction peaks for a FCC crystal structure can be calculated using the following formula:

2θ = arcsin (λ / 2d)

where 2θ is the diffraction angle, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation, and d is the interplanar spacing.

For a FCC crystal structure, the interplanar spacings can be calculated using the following formula:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter, and h, k, and l are the Miller indices.

Using these formulas, we can calculate the X-ray diffraction peaks for a pure copper powder sample. The results are:

* 200: 2θ = 50.4°
* 220: 2θ = 67.8°

(D) Phosphorus

Here's a brief explanation:

In basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking, the removal rate of elements from the hot metal is influenced by their reactivity and the conditions in the furnace. Phosphorus has a very low reactivity and is relatively difficult to remove from the steel. It forms a stable oxide that is not easily reduced by the oxygen in the furnace, which means it tends to remain in the steel.

In contrast, carbon, sulfur, and silicon are more reactive and can be removed more easily from the steel through oxidation and slag formation. Carbon is removed through oxidation with oxygen, sulfur is removed through oxidation and reaction with lime, and silicon is removed through oxidation and reaction with alumina.

Therefore, phosphorus has the slowest removal rate from hot metal in a BOF steelmaking process.";D;B;0;

Necking instability occurs when a material undergoes strain hardening, which means that the material becomes stronger as it is deformed. During tensile testing, this can lead to a situation where the material becomes stronger than the surrounding material, causing it to concentrate the stress and deform more rapidly. This can lead to a necking or narrowing of the specimen.

The condition for necking instability is given by the equation:

dσ/dε = 0

(B) c increases but a decreases

Here's a brief explanation:

In Fe-C alloys, the addition of carbon up to 2 mass% increases the lattice parameter ""c"" of the body-centered tetragonal (BCT) martensite structure.

(B) It is an austenite stabilizer

Nickel is a well-known austenite stabilizer, which means it increases the amount of austenite in steel and lowers the critical temperature (Ms) below which austenite transforms to ferrite. This is because nickel has a high atomic radius and a high atomic mass, which makes it difficult for it to form carbides and nitrides, and instead, it tends to form solid solutions with iron and carbon.

The other options are incorrect:

(A) Nickel actually decreases the Ms temperature, not increases it.

(A) Fine grain size (B) FCC crystal structure (C) High melting point (D) Cold worked microstructure ;"The correct answer is:

* A: Fine grain size
* C: High melting point

Explanation:

* Fine grain size (A) is desirable for achieving better creep resistance because it reduces the distance that dislocations need to travel to move through the material, making it more difficult for creep to occur.
* High melting point (C) is desirable for high-temperature applications because it indicates that the material can withstand high temperatures without degrading or losing its structural integrity.

The other options are not directly related to creep resistance:

* FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) crystal structure (B) is not a characteristic that directly affects creep resistance.
* Cold worked microstructure (D) can actually reduce creep resistance by introducing defects and dislocations that can facilitate creep.

If the pressure(in bar) outside the bubble is 1.5 bar, the pressure inside the bubble  is? (round off to 1 decimal place).;"To solve this problem, we can use the ideal gas law, which states that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume. Since the bubble is spherical, its volume is proportional to the cube of its radius. Therefore, we can write:

P_outside = P_inside × (R_outside / R_inside)^3

where P_outside is the pressure outside the bubble, P_inside is the pressure inside the bubble, R_outside is the radius of the bubble outside the steel, and R_inside is the radius of the bubble inside the steel.

Given that the surface tension of the steel is 1.4 N/m, we can assume that the pressure inside the bubble is equal to the pressure outside the bubble plus the surface tension divided by the radius of the bubble. Therefore, we can write:

P_inside = P_outside + (1.4 N/m) / (0.01 mm)

First, we need to convert the surface tension from N/m to Pa:

1.4 N/m = 1.4 × 10^3 Pa

Now, we can plug in the values:

P_inside = 1.5 bar + (1.4 × 10^3 Pa) / (0.01 mm)

First, we need to convert the pressure outside the bubble from bar to Pa:

1.5 bar = 1.5 × 10^5 Pa

Now, we can plug in the values:

P_inside = 1.5 × 10^5 Pa + (1.4 × 10^3 Pa) / (0.01 mm)

P_inside = 1.5 × 10^5 Pa + 1.4 × 10^7 Pa/m^3 × (0.01 mm)^3

P_inside = 1.5 × 10^5 Pa + 1.4 × 10^7 Pa/m^3 × 1 × 10^-8 m^3

1. Write the reaction equation: Mo(s) + O2(g)  MoO2(s)
2. Write the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction: K = (aMoO2 / aMo) × (pO2 / pMoO2)
3. Since the reaction is at 1873 K, we can use the given values of ΔG° and R to calculate the equilibrium constant K at this temperature.

ΔG° = -262300 J
ΔG° = -RT ln K
ln K = -ΔG° / RT
K = e^(-ΔG° / RT)

K = e^(-262300 J / (8.314 J K^-1 mol^-1 × 1873 K))
K ≈ 1.43 × 10^-44

4. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the equilibrium constant expression can be written as:

K = (aMoO2 / aMo) × (pO2 / pMoO2)
= (0.5 / 1) × (pO2 / pMoO2)

5. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the partial pressures of CO and CO2 are related by the equilibrium constant expression:

(pCO / pCO2) = K

Substituting the value of K, we get:

(pCO / pCO2) = 1.43 × 10^-44

6. Since the problem asks for the ratio of partial pressures, we can simplify the answer by taking the logarithm of both sides:

log(pCO / pCO2) = log(1.43 × 10^-44)
= -44.15

So, the equilibrium ratio of partial pressures is:

5. F (Faraday's constant): 96500 C·mol⁻¹

We are asked to calculate the standard Gibbs energy of formation of PbCl2 (liquid) at 873 K.

From the Nernst equation, we can relate the emf of the cell to the Gibbs energy change (ΔG) of the reaction:

ΔG = -nFE

where n is the number of electrons transferred, E is the potential difference (emf) of the cell, and F is the Faraday's constant.

known values:

emf (E) = 1.2327 V
F = 96500 C·mol⁻¹

First, we need to calculate the number of electrons transferred (n). We can do this using the half-cell reactions:

 oxidation of lead (Pb): Pb (Au-Pb alloy) → Pb²⁺ (PbCl₂) + 2e⁻
 reduction of lead(II) dichloride: PbCl₂ (PbCl₂) + 2e⁻ → Pb (Pb)

The number of electrons transferred is therefore:

n = 2 e⁻

Now, we can calculate the Gibbs energy change (ΔG):

ΔG = -nFE
= -(2 e⁻) × (96500 C·mol⁻¹) × (1.2327 V)

ΔG ≈ -238.04 kJ·mol⁻¹

To calculate the standard Gibbs energy of formation of PbCl2 (liquid) at 873 K, we need to subtract the Gibbs energy of the reactants from the Gibbs energy of the products, considering their activities:

ΔG˚(PbCl₂, liquid) ≈ ΔG - RT × ln (activity of Pb in the Au-Pb alloy) - RT × ln (activity of PbCl₂ in the electrolyte)

where R is the gas constant (8.314 J·K⁻¹·mol⁻¹) and T is the temperature (873 K).

(round off to the nearest integer).;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of sulfur removed from the steel.

Initial sulfur content in steel = 0.015 mass%
Final sulfur content in steel = 0.0025 mass%

Let's assume the initial mass of steel is 100 metric tons = 100,000 kg (since 1 metric ton = 1000 kg)

Initial amount of sulfur in steel = 0.015% x 100,000 kg = 1500 kg

After desulfurization, the amount of sulfur in steel = 0.0025% x 100,000 kg = 250 kg

Amount of sulfur removed = Initial amount of sulfur - Amount of sulfur after desulfurization = 1500 kg - 250 kg = 1250 kg

Now, we need to calculate the desulfurizing index. The desulfurizing index is defined as the amount of sulfur removed per unit mass of synthetic slag used.

where γi is the activity coefficient of component i, ΔHi is the partial molar enthalpy of component i, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and ni is the number of moles of component i.

Given the values:

R = 8.314 J·K¹·mol¹
ΔHi = -8300 J/mol
T = 1400 K
ni = 0.25 mol (since the mole fraction of Au is 0.25)

We can plug in the values and solve for ln γi:

ln γAu = (-8300 J/mol - (8.314 J·K¹·mol¹ × 1400 K × 0.25 mol)) / (8.314 J·K¹·mol¹)

We are given the values of γ, ΔH_m, and T. We can rearrange the equation to solve for r*:

r*² = ΔH_m / (4πγT) + ΔG / (4πγ)

We are also given that the undercooling is 10 K, so the temperature during solidification is 1356 - 10 = 1346 K.

We can calculate ΔG using the following equation:

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔG = (1.88 × 10^9 J/m^3) / (1346 K) = 1.41 × 10^8 J/m^3

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of y, which is the magnitude of the flux at x = 2 mm. The problem states that the concentration C of the solute in the solid is described by the expression:

C = a1*x^2 + a2*x

where a1 and a2 are constants.

Since the problem requires us to calculate the magnitude of the flux at x = 2 mm, we need to find the concentration C at this point. Since x = 2 mm, we can plug this value into the concentration equation to get:

C = a1*(2 mm)^2 + a2*(2 mm)

Simplifying, we get:

C = 4 a1 + 2 a2

Now, we know that a1 = a2 = 1, so:

C = 4*1 + 2*1

So, the concentration at x = 2 mm is 6 atoms/mm^3.

The flux (J) at x = 2 mm can be found using the formula:

J = -D * (dC/dx)

where D is the diffusion coefficient (given as 3 * 10^(-3) mm^2*s^(-1)), and dC/dx is the derivative of the concentration with respect to x.

To calculate the derivative dC/dx, we need to know the functional form of the concentration as a function of x. Given that the concentration is a quadratic function of x, we can write:

C = ax^2 + bx + c

Taking the derivative of C with respect to x, we get:

dC/dx = 2ax + b

Now, we can plug in the values of a1 and a2, which are equal to 1. We also know that dC/dx must be evaluated at x = 2 mm. So,

2ax + b = dC/dx
= - 6 * 10^(-3) atoms/mm^2*s^(-1)

Solving for a and b, we get:

a = 1.5 * 10^(-3) atoms/mm^5*s^(-1)
b = -2 * 10^(-3) atoms/mm^4*s^(-1)

Now, we can find the magnitude of the flux at x = 2 mm:

J = -D * (dC/dx)
= -(3 * 10^(-3) mm^2*s^(-1)) * (-2 * 10^(-3) atoms/mm^4*s^(-1))
= 1.5 * 10^(-3) atoms/mm^2*s^(-1)

To the nearest integer, the magnitude of the flux at x = 2 mm is:

Assuming that Dulong-Petit law is valid for a monoatomic solid, the ratio of heat capacities $C_(p)/C_(v)$ at 500K is? (round off to 3 decimals).;"To solve this problem, we need to use the following equations:

1. The molar volume (V) is related to the isothermal compressibility (κ) by:

V = RT/κP

2. The isobaric expansivity (β) is related to the molar volume by:

β = 1/V (dV/dT)

3. The heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) is related to the heat capacity at constant volume ( Cv) by:

Cp = Cv + βRT

We are given the following values:

* Molar volume (V) = 7 × 10^-6 m^3/mol
* Isothermal compressibility (κ) = 8 × 10^-12 Pa^-1
* Isobaric expansivity (β) = 6 × 10^-5 K^-1
* Gas constant (R) = 8.314 J/K/mol

First, we can calculate the molar volume in liters/mol:

V = 7 × 10^-6 m^3/mol × (1000 mL/1 L) × (1 L/0.001 m^3) = 7 L/mol

Next, we can calculate the isothermal compressibility in Pa^-1:

κ = 8 × 10^-12 Pa^-1

Now, we can calculate the isobaric expansivity in K^-1:

β = 6 × 10^-5 K^-1

We can now calculate the heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) using the Dulong-Petit law:

Cv = (3R) = 3 × 8.314 J/K/mol = 24.942 J/K/mol

Finally, we can calculate the ratio of heat capacities (Cp/Cv) using the equation:

Cp = Cv + βRT

Cp = 24.942 J/K/mol + (6 × 10^-5 K^-1) × 8.314 J/K/mol × 500 K = 25.042 J/K/mol

Now, we can calculate the ratio of heat capacities:

(round off to the nearest integer).;"To solve this problem, we can start by equating the heat input for both welds:

Heat input for first weld = Heat input for second weld

We are given that the arc heat transfer efficiency is 0.65, so we can write:

Assume specific heat capacity of air to be constant and equal to 1080 $J.kg^(-1).K^(-1)$ and π = 3.14. Air at 300 K is passed at a mass flow rate of 1.5 $kg.s^(-1)$ through a metallic tube of inner diameter 0.08 m. Inner wall temperature of the tube is maintained at 700 K. Temperature of the air leaving the tube is 600 K. Assuming that heat transfer occurs entirely by steady state convection, length of the tube(in metres) is? (round off to 2 decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the heat transfer rate (Q) using the convective heat transfer coefficient (h) and the temperature difference (ΔT) between the tube wall and the air:

Q = hAΔT

where A is the surface area of the tube and ΔT is the temperature difference.

2. Calculate the heat transfer rate (Q) using the energy balance equation:

Q = mc_pΔT

where m is the mass flow rate of air, c_p is the specific heat capacity of air, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

3. Equate the two expressions for Q and solve for the length of the tube (L).

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Given:

* h = 500 W/m²K
* c_p = 1080 J/kgK
* m = 1.5 kg/s
* A = πDL (where D is the inner diameter of the tube)
* ΔT = 700 K - 300 K = 400 K
* T_out = 600 K

First, calculate the surface area of the tube:

A = πDL
= π(0.08 m)(L)
= 0.2514L

Now, calculate the heat transfer rate using the convective heat transfer coefficient:

Q = hAΔT
= 500 W/m²K(0.2514L)(400 K)
= 251,400 W

Next, calculate the heat transfer rate using the energy balance equation:

Q = mc_pΔT
= (1.5 kg/s)(1080 J/kgK)(400 K)
= 648,000 W

Equating the two expressions for Q, we get:

(round off to the nearest integer).;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B, which means that the total amount of B in the alloy is 70 mol%.
2. The composition of β is 90 mol% B, which means that the amount of B in β is 90 mol% of the total amount of B in β.
3. Since the molar proportion of α to β is 2:1, the amount of B in α is 2/3 of the total amount of B in α and β.
4. Let's say the amount of B in α is x mol. Then, the amount of B in β is (70 - x) mol.
5. Since the composition of β is 90 mol% B, we can set up the equation:

(70 - x) = 0.9(70 - x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

70 - x = 63

x = 7

So, the amount of B in α is 7 mol.

The reaction is:

γ (0.8 wt.% C) → α (0.02 wt.% C) + Fe3C (6.67 wt.% C)

The initial composition of the steel is 0.45 wt.% C, which is between the solubility limits of carbon in alpha iron (0.02 wt.% C) and gamma iron (0.8 wt.% C). Therefore, the steel will undergo a eutectoid reaction, where the gamma phase decomposes into alpha phase and cementite (Fe3C).

The volume percentage of proeutectoid alpha can be calculated using the following steps:

1. Calculate the weight percentage of carbon in the gamma phase:

0.8 wt.% C (in gamma) - 0.02 wt.% C (in alpha) = 0.78 wt.% C (excess carbon)

2. Calculate the weight percentage of cementite that will form:

0.78 wt.% C (excess carbon) / 6.67 wt.% C (in cementite) = 0.117 (or 11.7%)

3. Calculate the weight percentage of alpha that will form:

1 - 0.117 (cementite) = 0.883 (or 88.3%)

4. Convert the weight percentage to volume percentage:

Density of alpha iron: 7.9 g/cm3

Volume percentage of alpha = (0.883 x 7.9 g/cm3) / (0.883 x 7.9 g/cm3 + 0.117 x 7.1 g/cm3) = 0.933 (or 93.3%)

(A) 44.9% (B) 55.1% (C) 40.9% (D) 59.1%;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume fraction of pearlite in the steel.

The reaction that occurs is:

γ (0.8 wt.% C) → α (0.02 wt.% C) + Fe3C (6.67 wt.% C)

This means that the steel transforms from a single-phase austenitic structure (γ) to a two-phase structure consisting of ferrite (α) and cementite (Fe3C).

The volume fraction of pearlite can be calculated using the following formula:

Vpearlite = (Vferrite + Vcementite) / (Vferrite + Vcementite + Vgamma)

where Vferrite, Vcementite, and Vgamma are the volumes of ferrite, cementite, and austenite, respectively.

First, we need to calculate the volume fractions of ferrite and cementite. The volume fraction of ferrite is given by:

Vferrite = (0.02 wt.% C) / (0.45 wt.% C) = 0.0444

The volume fraction of cementite is given by:

Vcementite = (0.8 wt.% C - 0.02 wt.% C) / (0.45 wt.% C) = 0.9556

Now, we can calculate the volume fraction of pearlite:

Vpearlite = (0.0444 + 0.9556) / (0.0444 + 0.9556 + 1) = 0.4591

Therefore, the volume fraction of pearlite is approximately 45.91%.

Given:

* Tensile load (P) = 20 kN = 20,000 N
* Cross-sectional area of steel bar (A) = 8 cm² = 8 × 10 m²
* Length of steel bar (L) = 1 m = 0.1 m
* Young's modulus of steel (Esteel) = 200 GPa = 200 × 10 Pa
* Young's modulus of aluminum (EAl) = 70 GPa = 70 × 10 Pa
* Poisson's ratio (ν) = 0.3

We are given that the same load is applied to an aluminum bar, and it produces the same elastic strain as the steel bar. The elastic strain (ε) is given by:

ε = P / (A × E)

Since the same load is applied to both bars, the elastic strain is the same for both:

εsteel = εAl

Substituting the values, we get:

P / (Asteel × Esteel) = P / (AAl × EAl)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Asteel / AAl = EAl / Esteel

Substituting the values, we get:

8 × 10 / AAl = 70 × 10 / (200 × 10)

AAl = 8 × 10 × (200 × 10) / (70 × 10)

The first diffraction peak corresponds to the (110) plane, which has a lattice parameter of a/√2.

The interplanar spacing (d) for the (110) plane is:

d = a/√2 = 2.494 Å/√2 = 1.764 Å

LEDs emit light when an electron recombines with a hole, releasing energy in the form of a photon. The energy of the photon is equal to the bandgap energy of the material. Since the LED is emitting at around 380 nm, we need a material with a bandgap energy that corresponds to this wavelength.

The energy of a photon is given by:

E = hc / λ

where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Rearranging this equation to solve for energy, we get:

E = hc / λ

Substituting λ = 380 nm, we get:

E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) x (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (380 x 10^-9 m) ≈ 2.5 eV

Now, we need to consider the bandgap energy of the materials listed:

(A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap: This material would have a bandgap energy less than 2.5 eV, which is unlikely to be suitable for emitting at 380 nm.

(B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap: This material would have a bandgap energy greater than 2.5 eV, which is also unlikely to be suitable for emitting at 380 nm.

(C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap: This material would have a bandgap energy greater than 2.5 eV, which is possible for emitting at 380 nm. However, the bandgap energy would need to be precisely matched to the energy of the photon.

(D) Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap: This material would have a bandgap energy less than 2.5 eV, which is possible for emitting at 380 nm. In fact, some indirect bandgap materials with small bandgaps, such as silicon, can be used to emit light at wavelengths around 380 nm.

Calculate the wavelength of the Xray used, in nm.;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation, which relates the wavelength of the X-ray, the lattice parameter of the metal, and the angle of diffraction.

The Bragg equation is:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, d is the lattice parameter, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

In this case, we are given the lattice parameter (d) and the angle of diffraction (θ) for the {200} peak. We can use the Bragg equation to solve for λ.

First, we need to find the value of d for the {200} peak. For an FCC metal, the lattice parameter is related to the distance between the centers of two adjacent atoms in the [200] direction. This distance is given by:

d = a/√2

where a is the lattice parameter.

Plugging in the value of a = 0.352 nm, we get:

d = 0.352 nm / √2 = 0.248 nm

Now we can use the Bragg equation to solve for λ:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

We are given that θ = 61.08°, so we can convert this to radians:

θ = 61.08° × (π/180) = 1.064 rad

Now we can plug in the values:

nλ = 2 × 0.248 nm × sin(1.064 rad)

Simplifying, we get:

nλ = 0.496 nm

Since n is an integer, we can divide both sides by n to get:

λ = 0.496 nm / n

The smallest value of n that satisfies the Bragg equation is n = 1, so:

λ = 0.496 nm / 1 = 0.496 nm

Therefore, the wavelength of the X-ray used is approximately 0.496 nm.

c = 0.56 nm

First, we need to calculate the area of the base of the unit cell:

where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the radiation.

We are given that the band gap energy of the semiconducting material is 1.43 eV. We can convert this to joules by multiplying by the conversion factor 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV:

E = 1.43 eV x 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV = 2.29 x 10^-19 J

We can now rearrange the formula to solve for λ:

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What is the relaxation time constant for this material?;"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relaxation in viscoelastic materials. The relaxation time constant (τ) is related to the stress relaxation of the material. When a stress is applied to an elastomer, it will initially deform elastically, but over time, the material will relax and the stress will decrease.

The stress relaxation can be described by the following equation:

σ(t) = σ0 \* e^(-t/τ)

where σ(t) is the stress at time t, σ0 is the initial stress, and τ is the relaxation time constant.

In this problem, the initial stress is 10 MPa, and the final stress is 5 MPa. The strain is held constant at 50%, which means that the material is still deformed by 50% of its original length.

We can use the equation above to find the relaxation time constant. First, we need to find the time at which the stress decreases to 5 MPa. Let's call this time t.

We can set up an equation using the equation above:

5 MPa = 10 MPa \* e^(-t/τ)

To solve for τ, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(5 MPa) = ln(10 MPa) - (t/τ) \* ln(e)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

t/τ = ln(2)

Now, we can solve for τ:

τ = t / ln(2)

We are given that t = 40 days. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:

τ = 40 days / ln(2)

τ ≈ 57.7 days

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What will be the stress after 60 days at 20°C?;"A classic problem in viscoelasticity!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The elastomer is subjected to a stress of 10 MPa, which generates a strain of 50%. This means that the material is in a state of elastic deformation.
2. The strain is held constant at 50% for 40 days. During this time, the material is in a state of creep, where the stress decreases due to the relaxation of the material.
3. After 40 days, the stress has decreased to 5 MPa. This means that the material has relaxed by 5 MPa, which is the amount of stress that was lost due to creep.
4. Since the strain is held constant at 50%, the material is still in a state of elastic deformation. The stress that is required to maintain this strain is now 5 MPa.
5. Since the material is in a state of elastic deformation, the stress will remain constant at 5 MPa for the next 20 days (60 days - 40 days).

Here's the explanation:

In a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, there are 12 possible slip systems. A slip system consists of a slip plane and a slip direction. In FCC metals, the slip planes are the {111}, {110}, and {100} planes, and the slip directions are the <110>, <112>, and <100> directions.

Each slip plane has three possible slip directions, so the total number of slip systems is:

**Cold working**: When a metal is cold worked, it is plastically deformed at room temperature. This process introduces many defects, such as dislocations, vacancies, and grain boundaries, which can lead to:

* Increased strength (due to the introduction of defects) [ Favorable for (A) ]
* Decreased ductility (due to the accumulation of defects) [ Favorable for (A) ]

**Recrystallization**: When a cold-worked metal is heated to a temperature above its recrystallization temperature (usually around 0.5 to 0.7 of its melting point), it undergoes a process known as recrystallization. This process involves the growth of new grains, which:

* Can lead to increased ductility (as the metal becomes more homogeneous and defect-free) [ Favorable for (B) or (C) ]
* Can lead to decreased strength (as the new grains have fewer defects) [ Favorable for (B) or (D) ]

Considering the effects of cold working and recrystallization, the correct answer is:

**C) Strength increases and ductility increases**: During recrystallization, the metal's ductility improves as the new grains become more defect-free, and its strength may even increase due to the growth of new grains with fewer defects.

Material Applications;4;G-XEC-2013-7;MCQS;47;In carbon fiber reinforced resin composites, for a given fiber volume content, Young’s modulus depends on the orientation of the fiber with respect to the applied load. Which orientation of the fibers will give the maximum value of Young’s modulus?  (A)transverse (B)longitudinal (C)random (D)both transverse and longitudinal;"The correct answer is:

(B) longitudinal

Explanation:

In carbon fiber reinforced resin composites, the Young's modulus of the composite material depends on the orientation of the fibers with respect to the applied load. When the fibers are oriented in the direction of the applied load, the composite material exhibits its highest stiffness and Young's modulus. This is because the fibers are able to resist the applied load more effectively when they are aligned with the direction of the load.

In contrast, when the fibers are oriented perpendicular to the applied load (transverse orientation), the composite material exhibits a lower Young's modulus, as the fibers are not able to resist the load as effectively.

Random orientation of the fibers would result in a lower Young's modulus than longitudinal orientation, as the fibers would not be able to resist the load as effectively.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) longitudinal.";B;B;1;

Degree of polymerization = Molecular weight / Monomer molecular weight

First, we need to find the molecular weight of the monomer (butadiene). The molecular formula for butadiene is C4H6, so its molecular weight is:

Molecular weight of butadiene = 4 x 12.01 g/mol (carbon) + 6 x 1.01 g/mol (hydrogen) = 56.08 g/mol

It is noticed that the alloy does not exhibit any strain hardening and fails at a total strain of 0.108. The mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material in MJ/$m^3$ is;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total energy absorbed by the material until it fails.

The total strain is given as 0.108, which is the sum of the elastic strain and the plastic strain. Since the material does not exhibit strain hardening, the plastic strain is equal to the total strain.

The elastic strain is given by:

ε_e = σ_e / E

where σ_e is the elastic stress and E is the Young's modulus. Since the material does not strain harden, the elastic stress is equal to the yield stress, which is 880 MPa.

ε_e = 880 MPa / (110 GPa) = 0.008

The plastic strain is given by:

ε_p = 0.108 - 0.008 = 0.100

The mechanical energy absorbed by the material is given by:

U = σ dε

where σ is the stress and ε is the strain. Since the material does not exhibit strain hardening, the stress is constant and equal to the yield stress.

U = σ dε = σ (ε_p - ε_e)

Substituting the values, we get:

U = 880 MPa (0.100 - 0.008) = 72.8 MJ/m^3

Therefore, the correct answer is:

If 100 g of water that is at 90 °C is added to the cup, the final temperature of water in °C is;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the copper cup contains 80 g of water at 4 °C.
2. The specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g °C, so the heat energy required to raise the temperature of 80 g of water from 4 °C to some higher temperature T is:

Q = mcΔT = 80 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (T - 4 °C)

3. When 100 g of water at 90 °C is added to the cup, the total amount of water is 180 g (80 g + 100 g). The heat energy of the added water is:

Q_add = mcΔT = 100 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (90 °C - T)

4. Since the heat energy is conserved, the heat energy gained by the added water is equal to the heat energy lost by the copper cup:

Q_add = -Q_copper

5. Substitute the expressions for Q_add and Q_copper into the equation above:

100 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (90 °C - T) = -80 g × 0.385 J/g °C × (T - 4 °C)

6. Simplify the equation and solve for T:

If the Young’s moduli of Ti and SiC are 110 and 360 GPa respectively, the volume fraction of fibers in the composite is;"To solve this problem, we can use the rule of mixtures to estimate the Young's modulus of the composite. The rule of mixtures states that the Young's modulus of a composite is given by:

E_c = V_f \* E_f + V_m \* E_m

where E_c is the Young's modulus of the composite, V_f is the volume fraction of the fibers, E_f is the Young's modulus of the fibers, V_m is the volume fraction of the matrix, and E_m is the Young's modulus of the matrix.

We are given that the Young's modulus of the composite is 185 GPa, and the Young's moduli of Ti and SiC are 110 GPa and 360 GPa, respectively. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for V_f:

V_f = (E_c - V_m \* E_m) / E_f

We are also given that V_m = 1 - V_f, since the volume fraction of the fibers plus the volume fraction of the matrix must add up to 1. Substituting this expression for V_m into the equation above, we get:

V_f = (E_c - (1 - V_f) \* E_m) / E_f

Simplifying this equation, we get:

V_f = (E_c - E_m) / (E_f + E_m)

Substituting the given values, we get:

V_f = (185 - 110) / (360 + 110) = 0.275

The formula for gallium arsenide is GaAs, which means that for every 1 mole of GaAs, there is 1 mole of Ga and 1 mole of As.

The molar mass of GaAs is the sum of the molar masses of Ga and As:

M(GaAs) = M(Ga) + M(As) = 69.72 g/mol + 74.92 g/mol = 144.64 g/mol

Since we want to make 1.0 kg of GaAs, we need to find the number of moles of GaAs:

n(GaAs) = mass(GaAs) / M(GaAs) = 1000 g / 144.64 g/mol = 6.89 mol

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

In this case, we are given the lattice parameter (a) of the face-centered cubic (FCC) Pt, which is 0.392 nm. We can use this value to calculate the spacing of the lattice planes.

The FCC lattice has a lattice parameter of a = √2a0, where a0 is the lattice parameter of the simple cubic lattice. Since the simple cubic lattice has a lattice parameter of a0 = √2a, where a is the lattice parameter of the FCC lattice, we can write:

a0 = √2a = √2(0.392 nm) = 0.558 nm

The spacing of the lattice planes (d) is given by the lattice parameter (a) and the Miller indices (h, k, l) of the plane:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

In this case, we are given the Miller indices (h, k, l) = (1, 1, 3), so we can calculate the spacing of the lattice planes:

d = a / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2) = 0.392 nm / √(1 + 1 + 9) = 0.147 nm

Now we can use Bragg's law to calculate the diffraction angle (θ) for the first-order reflection:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

where n = 1 is the order of reflection, λ = 0.1542 nm is the wavelength of the radiation, and d = 0.147 nm is the spacing of the lattice planes.

Rearranging the equation to solve for θ, we get:

sin(θ) = nλ / (2d)

sin(θ) = (1)(0.1542 nm) / (2(0.147 nm)) = 0.523

θ = arcsin(0.523) = 31.8°

where D is the diffusion coefficient, D0 is the zero-point diffusion coefficient, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given the diffusion coefficients at two different temperatures: 500 °C and 550 °C. We can use these values to solve for the activation energy.

First, we need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin: 500 °C = 773 K and 550 °C = 823 K.

Next, we can use the equation:

ln(D1 / D2) = -Ea / R * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

where D1 and D2 are the diffusion coefficients at 773 K and 823 K, respectively.

Plugging in the values, we get:

* This positive voltage causes the majority carriers (holes in the p-side and electrons in the n-side) to flow from their respective sides towards the junction.
* As a result, the majority carrier concentration increases on the side of the junction, while the minority carrier concentration (electrons in the p-side and holes in the n-side) decreases.
* Since the majority carrier concentration is much higher than the minority carrier concentration, the junction is said to have a low injection level.

So, the correct answer is:

* Yield strength (Q) depends on the mobile dislocation density, as it is influenced by the ease with which dislocations can move and interact with each other.
* Ductility (R) is also affected by the mobile dislocation density, as it is influenced by the ability of dislocations to move and interact with each other, allowing the material to deform plastically.
* Fracture toughness (S) is also influenced by the mobile dislocation density, as it is influenced by the ability of dislocations to move and interact with each other, affecting the material's resistance to crack propagation.

(B) decreases exponentially with temperature

In a pure metal, the equilibrium concentration of vacancies (i.e., the number of vacant lattice sites per unit volume) decreases exponentially with temperature. This is because the formation of vacancies requires the breaking of bonds between atoms, which becomes less likely as the temperature decreases.

(A) Incorrect: The concentration of vacancies does not increase exponentially with temperature.

(C) Incorrect: The concentration of vacancies does not vary linearly with temperature.

(D) Incorrect: The concentration of vacancies is not independent of temperature.

A) The potential energy of the solid is lowest: This is correct. When the atoms are at their equilibrium distance, the potential energy of the solid is at its minimum value.

B) The force of attraction between the atoms is maximum: This is incorrect. The force of attraction between atoms is typically a function of distance, and it decreases as the distance between atoms increases. At the equilibrium distance, the force of attraction is not maximum.

C) The force of repulsion between the atoms is zero: This is incorrect. At the equilibrium distance, the force of repulsion between atoms is not zero. In fact, the force of repulsion is typically zero at the equilibrium distance, but this is not the same as saying it is zero.

D) The potential energy of the solid is zero: This is incorrect. The potential energy of the solid is not zero at the equilibrium distance. It is at its minimum value, but not zero.

D) Upon heating through Tg, both the heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient change

Explanation:

* Tg (Glass Transition Temperature) is the temperature below which a material behaves like a glass, and above which it behaves like a liquid.
* As a material is heated through Tg, its heat capacity (Cp) changes, as the material transitions from a rigid, glassy state to a more fluid, liquid-like state.
* Additionally, the thermal expansion coefficient (α) also changes as the material transitions through Tg, as the material's ability to expand and contract changes.
* Options A and B are incorrect because Tg appears above the melting temperature in a perfectly crystalline material, and heat capacity remains constant but the thermal expansion coefficient changes are not accurate descriptions of the glass transition.

where $\sigma_0$ is a constant, $E_g$ is the energy gap, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

Now, we can rewrite this equation in the form:

$$y = mx + b$$

The eutectic reaction is a type of phase transition that occurs when a mixture of two or more substances is cooled or heated. In this reaction, the mixture undergoes a phase transition at a specific temperature, known as the eutectic temperature, below which the mixture becomes a single solid phase.

The correct answer is:

(B) L  S1 + S2

This reaction indicates that at the eutectic temperature, the liquid phase (L) is in equilibrium with two solid phases, S1 and S2. Below the eutectic temperature, the mixture will solidify as a single solid phase, consisting of a mixture of S1 and S2.

Calculate the original length of the iron rail track in cm. (linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The length of the iron rail track increases by 0.05 cm as the temperature increases from 15°C to 45°C.
2. The linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 × 10^(-6) K^(-1). This means that for every 1°C increase in temperature, the length of the iron rail track increases by 11.0 × 10^(-6) cm.
3. To find the original length of the iron rail track, we need to find the length increase due to the temperature change from 15°C to 45°C.
4. The temperature change is 45°C - 15°C = 30°C.
5. The length increase due to the temperature change is the product of the temperature change and the linear thermal expansion coefficient:
Length increase = Temperature change × Linear thermal expansion coefficient
= 30°C × 11.0 × 10^(-6) K^(-1)
= 0.033 cm
6. The original length of the iron rail track is the length increase subtracted from the final length:
Original length = Final length - Length increase

The absorption coefficient (α) of germanium at 1.3 µm is 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$.;"To solve this problem, we can use the Beer-Lambert law, which describes the absorption of light by a material. The law states that the intensity of the light (I) decreases exponentially with the distance (x) it travels through the material, according to the following equation:

I(x) = I0 \* e^(-αx)

where I0 is the initial intensity of the light, α is the absorption coefficient, and x is the distance through the material.

We are given that we want to absorb 80% of the incident radiation, which means that the intensity of the light after passing through the material should be 20% of the initial intensity. We can set up the following equation:

I(x) = 0.2 \* I0

Substituting the expression for I(x) from the Beer-Lambert law, we get:

0.2 \* I0 = I0 \* e^(-αx)

Dividing both sides by I0, we get:

e^(-αx) = 0.2

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

-αx = ln(0.2)

x = -ln(0.2) / α

Substituting the given values, we get:

x = -ln(0.2) / (3.3 \* 10^5 m^(-1))

x ≈ 0.025 mm

Since we are given the wavelength of the radiation (1.3 µm), we can convert the thickness to micrometers:

x ≈ 25 µm

Therefore, the thickness of the germanium crystal layer required to absorb 80% of the incident radiation with a wavelength of 1.3 µm is approximately 25 µm.

If the anode lasts for 60 days, what is the average corrosion current (in Amperes) during that period?;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of magnesium corroded and then use Faraday's law to calculate the average corrosion current.

The reaction of magnesium with seawater is:

Mg → Mg² + 2e

The mass of magnesium corroded can be calculated as:

Mass of Mg corroded = Mass of anode - Initial mass of anode
= 1 kg - 0 kg (since the anode is initially full)
= 1 kg

The atomic mass of magnesium is 24.31 amu, so the number of moles of magnesium corroded is:

Number of moles of Mg corroded = Mass of Mg corroded / Molar mass of Mg
= 1 kg / 24.31 g/mol
= 0.041 mol

The charge transferred in the reaction is 2e per mole of magnesium, so the total charge transferred is:

Total charge transferred = Number of moles of Mg corroded x Charge transferred per mole
= 0.041 mol x 2e
= 0.082 e

The time period for which the anode lasts is 60 days, which is equivalent to:

Time = 60 days x 24 hours/day x 3600 seconds/hour
= 5,184,000 seconds

The average corrosion current can be calculated using Faraday's law:

Average corrosion current = Total charge transferred / Time

Therefore, the average corrosion current is approximately 1.59 x 10 A.

1. The composite consists of 30 volume % SiC whiskers in an Al2O3 matrix. This means that the volume fraction of SiC is 0.3, and the volume fraction of Al2O3 is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.
2. The measured bulk density of the composite is 3.65 g/cm3.
3. The theoretical density of the composite can be calculated using the rule of mixtures:

ρ_theoretical = _SiC × V_SiC + _Al2O3 × V_Al2O3

where _SiC and _Al2O3 are the densities of SiC and Al2O3, respectively, and V_SiC and V_Al2O3 are their volume fractions.

ρ_theoretical = 3.22 g/cm3 × 0.3 + 3.95 g/cm3 × 0.7
= 3.46 g/cm3

4. The porosity of the composite can be calculated as:

Porosity (%) = (1 - _measured / _theoretical) × 100

Find the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$;"To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the diffusion coefficient to temperature:

D = Ae^(-Ea/kT)

where D is the diffusion coefficient, A is a frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

We are given the values of D at two temperatures: 400 K and 500 K. We can use these values to find the activation energy Ea.

First, let's rewrite the Arrhenius equation in logarithmic form:

log(D) = log(A) - Ea/kT

Now, let's take the difference between the logarithms of D at the two temperatures:

log(D400) - log(D500) = Ea/k(500)/k(400)

Simplifying, we get:

Ea = k(log(D400/D500))

Now that we have the value of Ea, we can plug it back into the Arrhenius equation to find the temperature at which D = 10^(-16) m^2s^(-1).

Log(D) = log(A) - Ea/kT

 substituting the values:

log(10^(-16)) = log(A) - Ea/kT

log(A) - Ea/kT = -16

We can now rearrange the equation to solve for T:

T = Ek(log(A) - (-16))/((Ea k))

ρ = mass / volume = 63.54 g/mol / 0.0444 g/cm^3 = 8.93 g/cm^3

To convert the density to kg/m^3, we multiply by 1000 (since there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram and 1000 cubic centimeters in 1 cubic meter):

ρ = 8.93 g/cm^3 x (1000 g/kg) / (1 cm^3/mL) x (1000 mL/L) x (1000 L/m^3) = 8930 kg/m^3

The band gap of silicon is 1.1 eV.;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy of the x-ray photon and compare it to the band gap energy of silicon.

The energy of the x-ray photon is given by:

E = hf = (1.54 keV) × (1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.47 eV

The band gap energy of silicon is 1.1 eV.

Since the energy of the x-ray photon is greater than the band gap energy, it can excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, creating an electron-hole pair.

However, the excess energy above the band gap energy (2.47 eV - 1.1 eV = 1.37 eV) is not sufficient to create additional electron-hole pairs. Therefore, only one electron-hole pair can be generated per x-ray photon.

So, the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV is:

(C) Characteristic X-rays from the sample

Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) is a technique used in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the elemental composition of a sample. It works by collecting the characteristic X-rays emitted by the sample when it is excited by the electron beam. The X-rays are then analyzed to determine the elemental composition of the sample.

(A) Secondary electrons are used in SEM to form the image of the sample, but they are not used in EDS.

(B) Backscattered electrons are also used in SEM to form the image of the sample, but they are not used in EDS.

If the lattice parameter is 4.1 Å, the angular position θ of the first diffraction peak(in degrees) is;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation, which relates the wavelength of X-rays, the lattice parameter of the material, and the angle of diffraction:

Rearranging the Bragg equation to solve for θ:

θ = arcsin(λ / (2d))

Mechanical Properties;5;G-XEC-2016-12;NUM;42;The yield strength of a ferritic steel increases from 120 MPa to 150 MPa when the grain size is decreased from 256 μm to 64 μm. When the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm, the expected yield strength(MPa) is ?;"A classic problem in materials science!

The question is asking about the Hall-Petch relationship, which states that the yield strength of a material increases as the grain size decreases.

The initial yield strength increase from 120 MPa to 150 MPa is due to the decrease in grain size from 256 μm to 64 μm.

To predict the yield strength at a grain size of 16 μm, we can use the Hall-Petch relationship, which is typically expressed as:

σy = σ0 + k / √d

where σy is the yield strength, σ0 is the friction stress, k is the Hall-Petch coefficient, and d is the grain size.

Rearranging the equation to solve for σy at a given grain size, we get:

σy = σ0 + k / √d

We know the initial yield strength (150 MPa) and the initial grain size (64 μm). We can use these values to calculate the Hall-Petch coefficient (k):

150 MPa = σ0 + k / √64 μm
k = (150 MPa - σ0) × √64 μm

Now, we can use the calculated value of k to predict the yield strength at a grain size of 16 μm:

σy = σ0 + k / √16 μm
= σ0 + (150 MPa - σ0) × √16 μm / √16 μm
= σ0 + (150 MPa - σ0)

Since we don't know the value of σ0, we can't give an exact answer. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the typical values of σ0 and k.

A commonly cited value for the Hall-Petch coefficient (k) is around 0.1-0.2 MPa√m. Let's assume k = 0.15 MPa√m for this problem.

Using the initial yield strength and grain size, we can estimate σ0:

150 MPa = σ0 + 0.15 MPa√m / √64 μm
σ0 ≈ 120 MPa

Now, we can predict the yield strength at a grain size of 16 μm:

σy = 120 MPa + (150 MPa - 120 MPa)
= 150 MPa

Therefore, the expected yield strength at a grain size of 16 μm is approximately 150 MPa.

A direct bandgap semiconductor has a bandgap of 1.8 eV. The threshold value of the wavelength(in Å) BELOW which this material will absorb radiation is;"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Convert the bandgap energy from eV to J: 1.8 eV = 1.8 × 1.6 × 10^-19 J = 2.88 × 10^-19 J
2. Use Planck's constant to relate the energy of a photon to its wavelength: E = hc / λ
3. Rearrange the equation to solve for λ: λ = hc / E
4. Plug in the values: λ = (6.626 × 10^-34 J s × 3 × 10^8 m/s) / (2.88 × 10^-19 J) = 0.874 × 10^-6 m = 874 nm

Since we want the wavelength in Å, we can convert the value: 874 nm = 874 × 10^-9 m × (1 Å / 0.1 × 10^-9 m) = 8.74 Å

So, the correct answer is:

We are given a galvanic cell with two half-cells:

Half-cell 2: Pure Cd immersed in a 1M aqueous solution of Cd² ions

The standard electrode reduction potentials of Ni and Cd are -0.250 V and -0.403 V, respectively.

The voltage of the cell is zero, which means that the cell is at equilibrium. At equilibrium, the electrochemical potential of the two half-cells is equal.

The electrochemical potential of a half-cell can be calculated using the Nernst equation:

where E is the electrochemical potential, E° is the standard electrode potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

For the Cd half-cell:

Given that the diffusion coefficient (D) of gallium in silicon at 1355 °C is 6×$10^(−11)$ $cm^2$ $s^(−1)$, the time(in seconds) the silicon wafer should be heated in contact with gallium vapour at 1355 °C is;"Let's break down the problem step by step!

The concentration of gallium at a depth of $10^{−3}$ cm is half the surface concentration, so we can set up an equation:

$C(x = 10^{−3} \text{ cm}) = \frac{1}{2}C_0$

where $C_0$ is the surface concentration.

We know that the diffusions coefficient is given by:

$D = 6 \times 10^{−11} cm^2 s^{−1}$

We also know that the diffusion equation is:

$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$

We can simplify this equation by considering the 1-D problem, where the concentration $C$ only depends on the depth $x$. Then:

$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$

$C(x, 0) = C_0 \mbox{ (initial condition, surface concentration)}$

$C(0, t) = 0 \mbox{ (boundary condition, no gallium at the surface)}$

Now, we can apply the error function solution:

$C(x, t) = \frac{C_0}{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{\infty}^{x/\sqrt{4Dt}} dt$

To solve this equation, we can use the fact that $erf(0.5) \approx 0.5$, where $erf$ is the error function.

Surface area = 4πr^2

where r is the radius of the sphere.

We are given that the specific surface area is 125 m^2/g, which means that the surface area of 1 gram of the particles is 125 m^2.

We can set up an equation using the formula above:

4πr^2 = 125 m^2

To solve for r, we can divide both sides by 4π:

r^2 = 125 m^2 / (4π)

r^2 = 9.93 nm^2

Taking the square root of both sides:

r = √9.93 nm^2 ≈ 3.13 nm

Since the particles are uniform in size, the diameter of the particles is twice the radius:

5. The weight of sulfur added is 10 g.
6. The total weight of sulfur and natural rubber combined is 50 g + 10 g = 60 g.
7. Since the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the number of mers of natural rubber is equal to the number of sulfur atoms.
8. The weight of one mer of natural rubber is 68 amu, so the weight of 10 g of sulfur is equivalent to 10 g / 32 amu = 312.5 mers of natural rubber.
9. Therefore, the total number of mers of natural rubber is 50 g / 68 amu = 735.3 mers.
10. The number of cross-linked sites that could be connected is equal to the number of mers of natural rubber minus the number of mers of natural rubber that are not cross-linked.

A second-order phase transition is a phase transition that occurs when the free energy of the system has a discontinuity in its second derivative with respect to temperature or pressure. This means that the thermodynamic properties of the system change abruptly at the transition point.

In this case, the correct answer is:

(D) Heat capacity

Heat capacity is a measure of the amount of heat energy required to change the temperature of a system by a given amount. During a second-order phase transition, the heat capacity of the system typically exhibits a discontinuity, meaning that it changes abruptly at the transition point. This is because the system's ability to absorb or release heat energy changes dramatically as it transitions from one phase to another.

Assuming two ethylene repeat units are contained within each unit cell, the density(in g/ $cm^3$) of a totally crystalline PE will be? (Take the atomic weights for carbon and hydrogen as 12.01 g/mol and 1.008 g/mol, respectively and the avogadro's number as 6.023* $10^(23)$ repeat units/mol);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mass of one unit cell and then divide it by the volume of the unit cell to get the density.

First, let's calculate the mass of one unit cell:

* The molecular formula of polyethylene is (C2H4)n, where n is the number of repeat units.
* Since two ethylene repeat units are contained within each unit cell, the molecular formula for the unit cell is (C2H4)2.
* The molar mass of (C2H4)2 is:
	+ 2(C) = 2(12.01 g/mol) = 24.02 g/mol
	+ 4(H) = 4(1.008 g/mol) = 4.032 g/mol
	Total molar mass = 24.02 g/mol + 4.032 g/mol = 28.052 g/mol
* The number of moles in one unit cell is:
	1 mole = 6.023 x 10^23 repeat units
	1 unit cell = 2 repeat units
	Number of moles in 1 unit cell = 2/6.023 x 10^23 = 3.34 x 10^22 mol
* The mass of one unit cell is:
	Mass of 1 unit cell = Number of moles in 1 unit cell x Molar mass
	= 3.34 x 10^22 mol x 28.052 g/mol
	= 9.36 x 10^22 g

Now, let's calculate the density:

* Volume of one unit cell = 0.0933 nm^3 = 9.33 x 10^-25 m^3 (convert nm^3 to m^3)
* Density = Mass of 1 unit cell / Volume of 1 unit cell
	= 9.36 x 10^22 g / 9.33 x 10^-25 m^3

The modulus of elasticity for this composite in the direction of fibre alignment in GPa;"To solve this problem, we can use the rule of mixtures to estimate the modulus of elasticity of the composite in the direction of fiber alignment.

The rule of mixtures states that the modulus of elasticity of a composite is given by:

E_c = V_f \* E_f + V_m \* E_m

where E_c is the modulus of elasticity of the composite, V_f is the volume fraction of the fibers, E_f is the modulus of elasticity of the fibers, V_m is the volume fraction of the matrix (resin), and E_m is the modulus of elasticity of the matrix.

Given the problem statement:

* V_f = 0.30 (30 vol%)
* E_f = 170 GPa (modulus of elasticity of the fibers)
* E_m = 3.0 GPa (modulus of elasticity of the resin)

We can plug in these values to get:

E_c = 0.30 \* 170 GPa + 0.70 \* 3.0 GPa
= 51.0 GPa + 2.1 GPa

Find x.";"To solve this problem, we can use Fick's Law of Diffusion, which states that the diffusivity (D) is related to the temperature (T) and the activation energy (Q) as follows:

D = D° ∙ exp(-Q/RT)

where D° is the reference diffusivity, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Given the values:

D° = 2 × 10^(-5) m²/s
Q = 142 kJ/mol = 142,000 J/mol
R = 8.314 J/mol·K

We need to find the value of D when T = 727 °C = 1000 K (since we need the temperature in Kelvin).

First, let's convert the temperature from °C to K:
1000 K = 727 °C

If the energy of formation of vacancies in pure copper is 0.9 ev, the fraction of vacancies pure copper at 27 ° C will be x * $10^(-16)$. Find x.;"To solve this problem, we need to use Boltzmann's formula for the probability of finding a system in a particular state:

P = exp(-E/kT)

where P is the probability, E is the energy of the state, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given that the energy of formation of vacancies in pure copper is 0.9 eV, and we need to find the fraction of vacancies at 27°C. First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:

T = 27°C + 273.15 = 300.15 K

Next, we can plug in the values we know into Boltzmann's formula:

P = exp(-0.9 / 2.586) ≈ 0.123

The probability of finding a vacancy is approximately 0.123. To find the fraction of vacancies, we need to multiply this probability by the total number of possible states:

Mechanical Properties;17;G-XEC-2017-18;NUM;35;A ceramic material with a critical flaw size of 30 μm has fracture stress of 300 MPa. For the same material the fracture stress(in Mpa) for a critical flaw size of 90 μm will be?;"A classic problem in fracture mechanics!

The question is asking about the effect of critical flaw size on the fracture stress of a ceramic material. The relationship between critical flaw size and fracture stress is described by the Weibull distribution.

The Weibull distribution states that the probability of failure (Pf) is given by:

Pf = 1 - exp(-V/V0)

where V is the volume of the material, V0 is the characteristic volume, and m is the Weibull modulus.

For a given material, the Weibull modulus (m) is related to the critical flaw size (a) and the fracture stress (σ) by:

m = (σa) / (σf a0)

where σf is the fracture stress for a critical flaw size of a0.

Given the problem statement, we know that:

* Critical flaw size (a) = 30 μm
* Fracture stress (σ) = 300 MPa
* Critical flaw size (a) = 90 μm (new)

We can use the Weibull distribution to relate the fracture stress for the new critical flaw size (a = 90 μm) to the original fracture stress (σ = 300 MPa).

First, we need to find the Weibull modulus (m) from the given data:

m = (σa) / (σf a0)
= (300 MPa × 30 μm) / (σf × 30 μm)
= 10

Now, we can use the Weibull distribution to find the fracture stress for the new critical flaw size (a = 90 μm):

Pf = 1 - exp(-V/V0)
= 1 - exp(-V0 / (V0 + V))
= 1 - exp(-1)

where V0 is the characteristic volume, and V is the volume of the material.

Since the probability of failure (Pf) is 1, we can set up the equation:

1 = exp(-1)

Taking the logarithm of both sides:

0 = -1

This is a contradiction, which means that the material will not fail for the given critical flaw size (a = 90 μm).

However, we can still find the fracture stress (σ) for the new critical flaw size (a = 90 μm) by using the Weibull distribution:

σ = σf × (a0 / a)^(1/m)
= 300 MPa × (30 μm / 90 μm)^(1/10)

3. We know the electron mobility: 3.2 × 10^-3 m²/Vs.
4. We know the electrical resistivity of copper: 1.7 × 10^-8 Ωm.

To find the average number of free electrons per atom in copper, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (EF) using the electron mobility:

DOS = (e/π) × (3/2) × (m*/kT)^(3/2) × (3/2)^(3/2)

where e is the elementary charge, m* is the effective mass of the electron, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

2. Calculate the number of free electrons per unit volume (n) using the DOS and the electron mobility:

n = DOS × v_F

where v_F is the Fermi velocity.

3. Calculate the average number of free electrons per atom (n_avg) by dividing the number of free electrons per unit volume by the atomic volume:

n_avg = n / V_atomic

Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of how much a material's magnetization responds to an external magnetic field. The sign of the magnetic susceptibility indicates the material's magnetic behavior:

* Diamagnetic materials have a negative magnetic susceptibility (ii is correct). This means that they weakly repel a magnetic field.
* Paramagnetic materials have a positive magnetic susceptibility (iv is correct). This means that they weakly respond to a magnetic field and tend to align with it.
* Antiferromagnetic materials have a negative magnetic susceptibility (iii is correct). This means that they respond to a magnetic field by developing a magnetic moment that opposes the applied field.

(C) Amorphous regions elongate in the stress direction and crystallites experience bending and stretching of chains

Explanation:

In semi-crystalline polymers with spherulitic morphology, the material consists of a mixture of crystalline and amorphous regions. During tensile deformation, the amorphous regions are more susceptible to deformation and will elongate in the direction of the stress. The crystalline regions, on the other hand, are more rigid and will experience bending and stretching of the molecular chains.

At the later stages of deformation, the amorphous regions will continue to elongate, while the crystalline regions will experience increased stress and strain, leading to bending and stretching of the molecular chains. This can result in the formation of defects such as microvoids and microcracks, which can ultimately lead to failure of the material.

Option A is incorrect because the amorphous regions do not remain intact, they elongate in the stress direction.

(ii) Branched polymers are more crystalline than the linear ones: This statement is false. Branched polymers have a more complex structure, which can hinder the formation of crystals and make them less crystalline.

(iii) Polymers with inter-chain interactions have higher glass transition temperature than those without inter-chain interactions: This statement is true. Inter-chain interactions can increase the energy required for the polymer chains to move and relax, resulting in a higher glass transition temperature.

(iv) Polymers with inter-chain interactions are more crystalline than those without inter-chain interactions: This statement is false.

(C) Presence of voids

Ceramic materials are known for their high theoretical strength, but they often fail at stresses much lower than their theoretical strength. This is due to the presence of defects such as voids, cracks, and impurities, which can act as stress concentrators and reduce the material's overall strength. Voids, in particular, can be a significant source of weakness in ceramic materials, as they can create stress concentrations that can lead to failure.

The other options are not correct:

(A) Dislocations are a type of defect that can occur in crystalline materials, but they are not typically a major contributor to the failure of ceramic materials.

(B) The elastic modulus of a material is a measure of its stiffness, and high elastic modulus is not typically a factor in the failure of ceramic materials.

(D) Anisotropy in the crystal structure of a material can affect its mechanical properties, but it is not a primary cause of failure in ceramic materials.

The Miller indices of a crystal plane are a set of three integers (h, k, l) that describe the orientation of the plane in three-dimensional space. The Miller indices are related to the lattice parameters of the crystal and the angle of incidence of the X-ray beam.

For iron, the lattice parameter is a = 0.287 nm, and the X-ray beam is incident at a glancing angle of about 10°. Using the Bragg equation and the lattice parameter, we can calculate the Miller indices of the first three Bragg peaks.

The first Bragg peak corresponds to the (100) plane, which has a Miller index of (1, 0, 0).

The second Bragg peak corresponds to the (110) plane, which has a Miller index of (1, 1, 0).

First, we can write the balanced equation for the anodic reaction:

Mg → Mg² + 2e

The number of moles of electrons (n) produced during this reaction is equal to the total charge (Q) divided by the charge per mole of electrons (F):

n = Q / F

where F is the Faraday constant (96500 C/mol).

Given that the total charge (Q) is 48250 C, we can calculate the number of moles of electrons:

n = 48250 C / 96500 C/mol = 0.5 mol

Now, we can use the molar mass of magnesium (24 g/mol) to calculate the amount of magnesium dissolved into the solution:

First, we need to find the number of holes (p-type carriers) and electrons (n-type carriers) in the semiconductor. Since it's an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of holes is equal to the number of electrons.

The concentration of electrons (n-type carriers) is given as 10^12 cm^-3. Since the semiconductor is intrinsic, the concentration of holes is also 10^12 cm^-3.

The mobility of both electrons and holes is given as 4 * 10^4 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1. This means that both electrons and holes have the same mobility.

The voltage applied across the cube is 100 V. Since the voltage is applied across the parallel end faces of the cube, the electric field is uniform and directed from the positive contact to the negative contact.

The current flowing through the semiconductor can be calculated using the formula:

I = q \* n \* μ \* E \* A

where I is the current, q is the charge of an electron (1.6 * 10^-19 C), n is the concentration of carriers (10^12 cm^-3), μ is the mobility of carriers (4 * 10^4 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1), E is the electric field (100 V / 1 cm = 100 V/cm), and A is the cross-sectional area of the cube (1 cm x 1 cm = 1 cm^2).

K = σ√πa

where K is the stress intensity factor, σ is the applied stress, and a is the crack length.

Given the values:

K = 25 MPa√m (fracture toughness)
a = 2 mm = 0.002 m (crack length)

The mass of the sample in air is 2.67 g and its apparent mass in water is 1.67 g. Calculate the density of the sample in g $cm^(-3)$ (give answer up to 2 decimal places);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The apparent mass of the sample in water is 1.67 g, which means that the buoyant force exerted by the water on the sample is equal to the weight of the sample in air minus its apparent mass in water:

Buoyant force = Weight of sample in air - Apparent mass of sample in water
= 2.67 g - 1.67 g
= 1.00 g

Since the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the sample in water, we can set up the following equation:

Weight of sample in water = Buoyant force
= 1.00 g

The weight of the sample in water is equal to the weight of the sample in air minus the weight of the water displaced by the sample:

Weight of sample in water = Weight of sample in air - Weight of water displaced
= 2.67 g - (Volume of sample x Density of water)
= 2.67 g - (Mass of sample in water / Density of water)
= 2.67 g - (1.67 g / 1.00 g/cm³)
= 2.67 g - 1.67 g
= 1.00 g

Now we can find the volume of the sample:

Volume of sample = Mass of sample in water / Density of water
= 1.67 g / 1.00 g/cm³
= 1.67 cm³

Finally, we can find the density of the sample:

Density of sample = Mass of sample / Volume of sample
= 2.67 g / 1.67 cm³
= 1.60 g/cm³

We are given the uncertainty in speed (Δv) and the speed itself (v), so we can use the following equation to relate the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in speed:

Δp = m \* Δv

where m is the mass of the electron.

We are also given the speed of the electron (v = 300 m/s) and the uncertainty in speed (Δv = 0.01% \* v = 0.003 m/s).

We can plug in the values to get:

Δp = (9.1 \* 10^(-31) kg) \* (0.003 m/s) = 2.73 \* 10^(-25) kg m/s

Δx \* Δp >= /2

Plugging in the values, we get:

Δx >= (6.6 \* 10^(-34) J s) / (2 \* (2.73 \* 10^(-25) kg m/s)) = 0.096 mm

The maximum number of peaks that can be observed is determined by the resolution of the X-ray diffractometer, which is typically limited by the wavelength of the X-ray radiation and the detector resolution.

The wavelength of the X-ray radiation is 0.229 nm, and the lattice parameter of the FCC polycrystalline aluminum is 0.405 nm.

(round off to the nearest whole number);"To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a chemical reaction to the activation energy (Q), gas constant (R), temperature (T), and a frequency factor (A):

k = Ae^(-Q/RT)

We are given the activation energy (Q) and the gas constant (R), and we want to find the temperature (T) at which the case depth can be doubled. Let's assume that the frequency factor (A) is constant, and we can ignore it for now.

Since the case depth is doubled, the rate constant (k) must be quadrupled. We can write an equation based on the Arrhenius equation:

k2 = 4k1

where k2 is the rate constant at the new temperature, and k1 is the rate constant at the original temperature.

Rearranging the equation to solve for T, we get:

In a non-linear molecule, the three atoms are not in a straight line. This means that the molecule has three translational degrees of freedom (three dimensions of motion).

The molecule also has three rotational degrees of freedom, since it can rotate around any of the three axes that pass through its center of mass.

Now, let's consider the vibrational degrees of freedom. In a triatomic molecule, there are three atoms, and each atom can vibrate along three axes (x, y, and z). However, since the molecule is non-linear, not all of these vibrations are independent. Specifically, the vibrations along the axes that pass through the center of mass of the molecule are not independent, since they are coupled to the rotational motion of the molecule.

Therefore, we need to subtract 3 from the total number of vibrational degrees of freedom, since three of them are coupled to the rotational motion.

If one of the repeat units is ethylene, the other one is  (A) $−CH_2−CH(CH_3)−$ (B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$ (C) $−CF_2−CF_2−$ (D) $−CH_2−CH(C_6H_5)−$;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The number-averaged molecular weight of the copolymer is 10^5 g/mol, which is the sum of the molecular weights of the individual repeat units.
2. The degree of polymerization is 2210, which means that the copolymer is composed of 2210 repeat units.
3. Since one of the repeat units is ethylene (C2H4), its molecular weight is 28 g/mol (2 x 12 g/mol for carbon + 4 x 1 g/mol for hydrogen).
4. Let's call the molecular weight of the other repeat unit ""x"". The total molecular weight of the copolymer is the sum of the molecular weights of the individual repeat units: 10^5 g/mol = 28 g/mol x 2210 + x.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 10^5 g/mol = 61,880 g/mol + x.
6. Subtracting 61,880 g/mol from both sides, we get: x = 10^5 g/mol - 61,880 g/mol.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A) -CH2-CH(CH3)-: This is a repeat unit of polyisobutylene, which has a molecular weight of 56 g/mol. This is not the correct answer, as the molecular weight of the other repeat unit is 38,120 g/mol, which is much higher than 56 g/mol.

(B) Increase in the solubility of impurities in solid as compared to that in liquid phase

Zone refining is a process that separates impurities from a molten metal by allowing the impurities to be removed at the end of the solidification process. The conditions that favor the separation of impurities in zone refining are:

* Increase in the gap between solidus and liquidus lines (A): This allows for a larger temperature range over which the impurities can be removed.
* Agitation of melt (C): This helps to distribute the impurities evenly throughout the melt, allowing them to be removed more effectively.
* Low cooling rate of melt (D): This allows the impurities to have more time to diffuse to the end of the solidification process, where they can be removed.

On the other hand, an increase in the solubility of impurities in solid as compared to that in liquid phase (B) would actually hinder the separation of impurities in zone refining, as it would make it more difficult for the impurities to be removed from the solidifying metal.";B;B;1;

Nickel corrodes at 298 K in a solution of 0.06 M nickel chloride having pH 4. Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the standard electrode potential (E°) for the reaction:

Ni (s) → Ni2+ (aq) + 2e-

Using the given values, we can calculate E° as follows:

E° = E°(Ni2+/Ni) = 0.25 V

Since the reaction is irreversible, we can use the Nernst equation in its simplest form:

E = E° + (RT/F) ln Q

where R is the gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

Since the pH is 4, the reaction quotient Q = [H+]1/Ni2+ = 10^(-4)

Substituting the values, we get:

E = 0.25 + (8.314 J/K/mol \* 298 K \* 8.314 J/k/mol/e-)/(96500 C/mol/e+) \* ln (10^(-4))

E ≈ 0.13 V

To stop the corrosion, we need to apply a potential that is more positive than the corrosion potential, so we can set the desired potential equal to the corrosion potential:

E = E° + (RT/F) ln Q

Rearranging the terms, we get:

ln Q = (E - E°) (F/RT)

Substituting the values, we get:

ln Q ≈ (E - E°) (96500 C/mol/e+)/8.314 J/k/mol/e+) \* 298 K

Simplifying, we get:

ln Q ≈ -8

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

Q ≈ 10^(-8)

This is the concentration of hydrogen ions required to stop the corrosion of nickel.

Now, we can calculate the partial pressure of hydrogen required to achieve this concentration, using the Henry's law:

(round off to 2 decimal places);"To find the equilibrium distance, we need to find the value of r that minimizes the potential energy U(r).

We can do this by taking the derivative of U(r) with respect to r and setting it equal to zero:

dU/dr = -3A/r^4 + 7B/r^8 = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-3A/r^4 + 7B/r^8 = 0

Multiplying both sides by r^4, we get:

-3Ar^4 + 7B = 0

Rearranging the equation, we get:

3Ar^4 = 7B

Dividing both sides by 3A, we get:

r^4 = 7B/3A

Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get:

r = (7B/3A)^(1/4)

When true strain is 0.05, the true stress is 350 MPa. For the same alloy, when engineering strain is 0.12 then the engineering stress(in MPa) is? (round off to the nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we can start by rearranging the given equation to express true stress as a function of true strain:

σ = 600ε^n

We are given that when true strain is 0.05, the true stress is 350 MPa, so we can substitute these values into the equation to find the value of n:

350 = 600(0.05)^n

Simplifying this equation, we get:

350 = 30(0.05)^n

Dividing both sides by 30, we get:

11.67 = (0.05)^n

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(11.67) = n log(0.05)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

n = log(11.67) / log(0.05)

n ≈ 2.53

Now that we have found the value of n, we can use the original equation to find the true stress when the true strain is 0.12:

σ = 600(0.12)^2.53

σ ≈ 540.5 MPa

To find the engineering stress, we need to convert the true stress to engineering stress. Since the true strain is 0.12, the engineering strain is also 0.12 (since the true strain is the same as the engineering strain in this case). We can use the following formula to convert true stress to engineering stress:

σ_e = σ_t (1 + ε_e)

where σ_e is the engineering stress, σ_t is the true stress, and ε_e is the engineering strain.

Substituting the values, we get:

The zero point energy(in ev) of an electron in a box of 0.2 nm width is? (round off to 1 decimal place);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the zero-point energy of the electron in the box.

The zero-point energy of a particle in a one-dimensional box is given by:

E0 = (πh)/(2ma)

where E0 is the zero-point energy, h is the Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, and a is the width of the box.

Given the width of the box is 0.2 nm, we can convert it to meters:

a = 0.2 nm = 2 × 10^-10 m

The mass of the electron is given as 9.11 × 10^-31 kg.

E0 = (π × 6.63 × 10^-34 J s)/(2 × 9.11 × 10^-31 kg × 2 × 10^-10 m)

E0 = 1.43 × 10^-18 J

The de Broglie wavelength of an electron accelerated across a 300 kV potential in an electron microscope is x * $10^(-12)$ m. Find x. Ignore relativistic effects. (round off to 2 decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the de Broglie equation, which relates the wavelength of a particle to its momentum:

λ = h / p

where λ is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the momentum of the particle.

First, we need to find the momentum of the electron. We can do this by using the equation:

p = mv

where m is the mass of the electron and v is its velocity. Since the electron is accelerated across a potential difference of 300 kV, we can use the equation:

K = qV

where K is the kinetic energy of the electron, q is the charge of the electron, and V is the potential difference. Since the electron is accelerated, its kinetic energy is equal to its potential energy, so:

K = qV = (1.6*10^-19 C)(300*10^3 V) = 4.8*10^-16 J

We can now find the velocity of the electron using the equation:

K = (1/2)mv^2

Rearranging this equation to solve for v, we get:

v = sqrt(2K/m) = sqrt(2(4.8*10^-16 J)/(9.11*10^-31 kg)) = 1.38*10^6 m/s

Now we can find the momentum of the electron using the equation:

p = mv = (9.11*10^-31 kg)(1.38*10^6 m/s) = 1.26*10^-24 kg m/s

Finally, we can find the wavelength of the electron using the de Broglie equation:

λ = h / p = (6.63*10^-34 J s) / (1.26*10^-24 kg m/s) = 5.27*10^-10 m

(round off to the nearest integer);"Let's analyze the situation:

1. The initial stress is 17 MPa.
2. The stress drops to 16.6 MPa after 100 hours, which means the stress has decreased by 0.4 MPa (17 - 16.6 = 0.4).
3. The stress must remain above 14.5 MPa for the assembly to function properly.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

17 - 0.4x = 14.5

Solving for x, we get:

0.4x = 17 - 14.5

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The material has a Young's modulus of 72 GPa, which is a measure of its stiffness.
2. The polarization of the material is changing from 640 to 645 C/m³, which means that the material is being subjected to a stress that is causing a change in its electric polarization.
3. The stress required to cause this change in polarization is given in MPa (megapascals), which is a unit of pressure.
4. To find the stress required, we need to use the definition of piezoelectricity and the given values.

Let's assume that the material is subjected to a stress σ (in MPa) that causes a change in polarization ΔP (in C/m³). We can write an equation relating the stress and the change in polarization:

ΔP = kσ

where k is a constant that depends on the material's properties.

We are given that the polarization changes from 640 to 645 C/m³, so ΔP = 5 C/m³. We are also given that the Young's modulus is 72 GPa, which is equivalent to 72,000 MPa.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

Solving for k, we get:

where B is the magnetic field required to demagnetize the bar, μ0 is the permeability of free space (approximately 4π x 10^-7 T·m/A), n is the number of turns of wire in the solenoid (150 turns in this case), and I is the current required in the solenoid.

The coercivity of the iron bar magnet is 7000 A/m, which is the magnetic field strength required to demagnetize the bar. We can set up an equation to solve for I:

The effective diffusion coefficient is related to the actual diffusion coefficient D and the time t by:

Depth^2 = 2Dt

Where depth is the distance from the surface of the metal where the copper concentration is the same in both experiments.

Given that the concentration is the same at the same depth in both experiments, we can set the depth to be the same in both cases. Let's call it x.

Since the diffusion coefficient at 400°C is 5*10^(-14) m^2 s^(-1), the time required to achieve the given concentration at a depth of x at 400°C is:

t_1 = x^2 / (2 * 5*10^(-14))

Similarly, the time required to achieve the same concentration at the same depth at 500°C is:

t_2 = x^2 / (2 * 6*10^(-13))

We are given that the concentration and depth are the same in both experiments, so t_1 = t_2. We can rewrite this equation as:

x^2 / (2 * 5*10^(-14)) = x^2 / (2 * 6*10^(-13))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5*10^(-14) = 6*10^(-13)

Dividing both sides by 6*10^(-14), we get:

Now, we can find the time required at 500°C as:

We need to find the atomic percentage of carbon in iron.

First, let's find the total weight of one mole of iron:

Total weight of one mole of iron = Atomic weight of Fe = 56

Since carbon is 6% by weight in iron, the weight of carbon in one mole of iron is:

Weight of carbon in one mole of iron = 6% of 56 = 0.06 × 56 = 3.36

In this case, we have two phases: α-phase (97 wt% Pb) and β-phase (99 wt% Sn). Since Pb has a higher atomic number (82) than Sn (50), the α-phase will produce more BSE than the β-phase.

The ratio of BSE intensity from α-phase to β-phase can be estimated by comparing the atomic numbers:

Pb (82) / Sn (50) ≈ 1.64

This means that the α-phase will produce approximately 1.64 times more BSE than the β-phase.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C)	Statement-1 is TRUE but Statement -2 is FALSE.  (D)	Statement-1 is FALSE but Statement-2 is TRUE.;"Let's analyze the statements:

Statement-1: Sintering in vacuum leads to improved densification as compared to sintering under ambient (at atmospheric pressure) condition.

This statement is TRUE. Sintering in vacuum can lead to improved densification because there are no gases present to prevent particles from coming into close contact and bonding with each other. In contrast, sintering under ambient conditions can be hindered by the presence of gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen, which can react with the particles and prevent them from bonding.

Statement-2: Closed pores formed during sintering inhibit full densification.

This statement is also TRUE. Closed pores are pores that are not connected to the surface of the material and are therefore not able to be eliminated during sintering. These closed pores can prevent the material from achieving full densification, as they can trap air and prevent the particles from coming into close contact with each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

where n is the order of the reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the spacing between the planes, and θ is the Bragg angle.

Given the lattice parameter a = 3.5 Å, we can calculate the spacing between the planes using the formula:

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the plane.

For the fourth reflection, the Miller indices are (h, k, l) = (4, 0, 0), so:

d = a / √(4² + 0² + 0²) = a / 4 = 3.5 Å / 4 = 0.875 Å

Now we can use the Bragg equation to find the Bragg angle:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

Rearranging to solve for θ:

θ = arcsin(nλ / 2d)

Substituting the values:

θ = arcsin((4)(1.54056 Å) / (2(0.875 Å)))
θ ≈ 93.80°

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy, ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the entropy change.

For the formation of a Schottky defect, the enthalpy change (ΔH) is equal to the activation energy for the formation of the defect, which is given as 250 kJ/mol.

The entropy change (ΔS) can be calculated using the following equation:

ΔS = R ln(N/N0)

where R is the gas constant, N is the number of defects, and N0 is the number of lattice sites.

We are given that the Avogadro number (N0) is 6.023*10^23 mol^-1, and the universal gas constant (R) is 8.314 J.K^-1.mol^-1.

We are also given that the temperature (T) is 300 °C, which is equal to 573 K.

Plugging in the values, we get:

ΔS = 8.314 J.K^-1.mol^-1 * ln(N/6.023*10^23 mol^-1)

Now, we can use the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS to calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the formation of a Schottky defect.

ΔG = 250 kJ/mol - 573 K * 8.314 J.K^-1.mol^-1 * ln(N/6.023*10^23 mol^-1)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

ΔG = 250 kJ/mol - 47.3 J/mol * ln(N/6.023*10^23 mol^-1)

Now, we can use the equation ΔG = -RT ln(K) to calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for the formation of Schottky defects.

K = exp(-ΔG/RT)

Substituting the values, we get:

K = exp(-(250 kJ/mol - 47.3 J/mol * ln(N/6.023*10^23 mol^-1)) / (8.314 J/mol * K))

Now, we can use the equation K = N/N0 to calculate the number of Schottky defects per mole of KCl.

N = K * N0

Substituting the values, we get:

N = exp(-(250 kJ/mol - 47.3 J/mol * ln(N/6.023*10^23 mol^-1)) / (8.314 J/mol * K)) * 6.023*10^23 mol^-1

Let P(n) denote the probability that there will be no accident over a period of ‘n’ months. Assume that the events of individual months are independent of each other. The smallest integer value of ‘n’ such that P(n) ≤ ½ is? (round off to the nearest integer);"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The probability of no accident occurring in a given month is 1 - (probability of an accident occurring) = 1 - 1/100 = 99/100.

Since the events of individual months are independent, the probability of no accident occurring over a period of 'n' months is the product of the probabilities of no accident occurring in each month:

P(n) = (99/100)^n

We want to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½. This means we want to find the smallest 'n' such that:

(99/100)^n ≤ ½

To solve this inequality, we can take the logarithm of both sides:

log((99/100)^n) ≤ log(½)

Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:

n log(99/100) ≤ log(½)

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side:

log(½) = -log(2)

So, the inequality becomes:

n log(99/100) ≤ -log(2)

To find the smallest integer value of 'n' that satisfies this inequality, we can use a calculator or approximation methods. After doing so, we find that:

n ≈ 7.65

Rounding up to the nearest integer, we get:

n = 8

Therefore, the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½ is 8.

Assume that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy.;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the surface energy of the {111} and {100} surfaces of a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal.

The surface energy of a metal surface is given by the following equation:

γ = (1/2) \* Σ \* (1 - cos(θ))

where γ is the surface energy, Σ is the surface area per atom, and θ is the angle between the surface normal and the bond direction.

For an FCC metal, the nearest neighbor distance is given by:

d = a / √2

where a is the lattice parameter.

The surface area per atom for the {111} surface is:

Σ_{111} = 2 \* √3 \* a^2 / 4

The surface area per atom for the {100} surface is:

Σ_{100} = a^2

The angle between the surface normal and the bond direction for the {111} surface is:

cos(θ_{111}) = 1/3

The angle between the surface normal and the bond direction for the {100} surface is:

cos(θ_{100}) = 1

Substituting these values into the equation for surface energy, we get:

γ_{111} = (1/2) \* (2 \* √3 \* a^2 / 4) \* (1 - 1/3) = 0.57735 \* Σ

γ_{100} = (1/2) \* a^2 \* (1 - 1) = 0 \* Σ

The ratio of the surface energy of the {111} surface to the {100} surface is:

γ_{111} / γ_{100} = 0.57735 / 0 = 

However, since the surface energy of the {100} surface is zero, the ratio is undefined. This is because the {100} surface is a low-index surface that has a high density of atoms, which means that the surface energy is zero.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

At temperature T = 300K, the shift in Fermi energy(in ev) upon doping with respect to intrinsic Fermi level of pure Si will be? (with appropriate sign and round-off to two decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we need to find the intrinsic carrier concentration (ni) of pure silicon and then calculate the shift in Fermi energy upon doping with phosphorus.

First, let's calculate the intrinsic carrier concentration (ni) of pure silicon:

ni = 2 * (2πmkBT/h^2)^(3/2) * exp(-Eg/kBT)

where:
m = 9.1 × 10^(-31) kg (mass of an electron)
kB = 1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K (Boltzmann constant)
h = 6.6 × 10^(-34) J·s (Planck's constant)
Eg = 1.1 eV (band gap energy of silicon)
T = 300 K (temperature)

Plugging in the values, we get:

ni = 2 * (2π(9.1 × 10^(-31) kg)(1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K)(300 K)/(6.6 × 10^(-34) J·s)^2)^(3/2) * exp(-1.1 eV/(1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K)(300 K))
ni ≈ 1.03 × 10^10 cm^(-3)

Now, let's calculate the shift in Fermi energy (ΔEF) upon doping with phosphorus:

ΔEF = -kT * ln(ni/N)

where:
N = 5 × 10^(28) atoms/m^3 (concentration of phosphorus atoms in the doped silicon)
ni = 1.03 × 10^10 cm^(-3) (intrinsic carrier concentration of pure silicon)

Plugging in the values, we get:

ΔEF = -1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K * ln(1.03 × 10^10 cm^(-3)/(5 × 10^(28) atoms/m^3))
ΔEF ≈ -0.05 eV

The magneteic moments of cations on octahedral sites are antiparallel with respect to those on tetrahedral sites. Atomic number of Fe is 26 and that of O is 8. The saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_(3)O_(4)$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons ($µ_B$) will be ? Ignore contribution from orbital magnetic moments.;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the saturation magnetic moment of Fe3O4 per formula unit.

From the problem, we know that:

* 1/8 of the tetrahedral sites are occupied by half of the B cations.
* 1/2 of the octahedral sites are occupied by the A cations (Fe) and the remaining B cations.

The magnetic moments of the cations on the octahedral sites are antiparallel to those on the tetrahedral sites. This means that the magnetic moments of the cations on the octahedral sites will cancel out each other, leaving only the net magnetic moment due to the cations on the tetrahedral sites.

Since 1/8 of the tetrahedral sites are occupied by half of the B cations, each of which has a magnetic moment of 5µB (for Fe, the atomic number is 26, and since the orbital contribution is ignored, the total magnetic moment is due to spin only, which is 5µB for Fe), the total magnetic moment due to the cations on the tetrahedral sites is:

(1/8) × (0.5 × 5µB) = 0.3125µB

Since the formula unit of Fe3O4 has three Fe ions, the total saturation magnetic moment per formula unit is:

The ΔW/A (in mg.$cm^(-2)$) after 500 min at 600°C will be? (round-off to two decimal places).;"Let's analyze the problem:

* The isothermal weight gain per unit area (ΔW/A) follows a parabolic rate law, which means that the rate of oxidation is proportional to the square root of time.
* The problem gives us the value of ΔW/A after 100 minutes of oxidation: ΔW/A = 1.0 mg/cm².
* We need to find the value of ΔW/A after 500 minutes of oxidation.

To do this, we can use the parabolic rate law equation:

ΔW/A = k \* √t

where k is a constant and t is the time in minutes.

We are given the value of ΔW/A after 100 minutes, so we can plug that in and solve for k:

1.0 mg/cm² = k \* √100

k = 1.0 mg/cm² / √100 = 0.1414 mg/cm²/min²

Now we can use the value of k to find the value of ΔW/A after 500 minutes:

ΔW/A = k \* √500

The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer).;"To solve this problem, we can use the solution diffusion equation to model the carburization process. The equation is:

dC/dt = D \* (C_pixelsurf - C advice)

where:

* C_pixelsurf is the carbon concentration at the surface (1.0 wt%)
* C_advise is the carbon concentration at the depth of interest (0.46 wt%)
* D is the diffusion coefficient of carbon in iron (6.0 * 10^-11 m^2/s)
* t is the time (hours)
* pixsurf is the surface area (5 mm in this case, since we're interested in the carbon concentration at a depth of 5mm)

First, we need to calculate the carbon concentration profile in the steel. This can be done by transforming the diffusion equation into a holding problem (a 2-point boundary value problem). The solution is:

C(x) = C_pixelsurf + (C_advise - C_pixelsurf) * (1 - exp(- (x^2 * π^2) / (4 * D * t)))

where x is the distance from the surface.

Now, we can set up an equation to calculate the carburization time. Since C(5mm) = 0.46 wt%, we can plug in the values:

0.46 = 1.0 + (0.46 - 1.0) * (1 - exp(- (5^2 * π^2) / (4 * D * t)))

The lowest value of $T_f$( in °C) at which material will fail is?(round off to the nearest integer.). Assume that there is no plastic deformation during thermal cycling.;"To solve this problem, we need to find the temperature at which the material will fail due to compressive stress. We can do this by using the following equation:

ΔL = α \* L \* ΔT

where ΔL is the change in length, α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, L is the initial length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Since the material is dimensionally constrained, the change in length is equal to the change in length due to thermal expansion:

ΔL = α \* L \* ΔT

We can rearrange this equation to solve for ΔT:

ΔT = ΔL / (α \* L)

We are given that the material can withstand a maximum compressive stress of 200 MPa without failure. This means that the maximum compressive strain (ΔL/L) is equal to 200 MPa / E, where E is the modulus of elasticity.

ΔL/L = 200 MPa / E

We can substitute the given values for E and α:

ΔL/L = 200 MPa / (200 GPa) = 1 × 10^(-3)

The Gibbs energy of a system is given by:

G = μAxA + μBxB

where μA and μB are the chemical potentials of components A and B, respectively, and xA and xB are their mole fractions.

For the α and β phases to be in equilibrium, the Gibbs energy of the system must be minimum. This is because the system will tend to minimize its Gibbs energy, which is a measure of the system's free energy.

Now, let's consider the condition for equilibrium. At equilibrium, the chemical potentials of the two phases must be equal:

μAα = μAβ
μBα = μBβ

Substituting these conditions into the Gibbs energy equation, we get:

Gα = μAαxAα + μBαxBα
Gβ = μAβxBβ + μBβxBβ

[A] crystallite size of the material

X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak broadening is a technique used to estimate the crystallite size of a material. Crystallites are small regions of a material that have a specific crystal structure. The size of these crystallites can be estimated by analyzing the width of the XRD peaks.

The width of the XRD peak is affected by the size of the crystallites, with smaller crystallites resulting in broader peaks and larger crystallites resulting in narrower peaks. By analyzing the peak width, researchers can estimate the average size of the crystallites in the material.

The other options are not correct:

[B] Microstrain refers to the distortion of the crystal lattice due to defects or impurities, which can also affect the XRD peak width. However, peak broadening is not a direct measure of microstrain.

[C] Precise lattice parameter refers to the accurate measurement of the distance between atoms in a crystal lattice. While XRD can be used to measure lattice parameters, peak broadening is not a direct measure of this.

[D] Residual macrostress refers to the stress that remains in a material after it has been subjected to external forces. While stress can affect the XRD peak width, peak broadening is not a direct measure of residual macrostress.

Fe - 10 atom % C austenite (fcc), having no Fe vacancies, has a lattice parameter of 4 Å. The density of austenite in g $cm^(−3)$ is? (round off to 2 decimal places)";"To solve this problem, we need to find the density of the austenite. We are given that the lattice parameter is 4 , which means the distance between two adjacent atoms in the lattice is 4 .

The density of a material can be calculated using the following formula:

ρ = (m / V)

where  is the density, m is the mass of the material, and V is the volume of the material.

We are given that the austenite is 10 atom% C, which means that 10% of the atoms in the lattice are carbon atoms. The remaining 90% are iron atoms.

The atomic weight of iron is 55.8, and the atomic weight of carbon is 12.0. Therefore, the average atomic weight of the austenite can be calculated as:

Average atomic weight = (0.9 x 55.8) + (0.1 x 12.0) = 50.02

The number of atoms in the lattice can be calculated using Avogadro's number:

Number of atoms = (Volume of the lattice) x (Number of atoms per unit volume)

The volume of the lattice can be calculated using the lattice parameter:

Volume of the lattice = (4 )^3 = 64 ^3

The number of atoms per unit volume can be calculated using the average atomic weight and the atomic weight of iron:

Number of atoms per unit volume = (Average atomic weight) / (Atomic weight of iron)

Number of atoms per unit volume = 50.02 / 55.8 = 0.897

Now, we can calculate the number of atoms in the lattice:

Number of atoms = (Volume of the lattice) x (Number of atoms per unit volume)
= 64 ^3 x 0.897
= 57.28 x 10^22 atoms

The mass of the material can be calculated using the number of atoms and the average atomic weight:

Mass = Number of atoms x Average atomic weight
= 57.28 x 10^22 atoms x 50.02
= 2.864 x 10^24 grams

Finally, we can calculate the density:

Phase Transition;16;G-XEC-2021-15;NUM;82;(Given: 1 atm = 1.01325 × $10^(5)$ Pa). An element transforms from α to β at 773 K and 1 atm pressure with 912 J $mol^(−1)$ as enthalpy of transformation. The molar volumes of α and β phases are 7.377 $cm^3$ and 7.317 $cm^3$ , respectively. Assume that the difference in molar volumes of α and β is independent of pressure. The pressure (in atm) required for α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is (round off to nearest integer);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The enthalpy of transformation (ΔH) is given as 912 J/mol.
2. The temperature at which the transformation occurs is 773 K.
3. The pressure at which the transformation occurs is 1 atm.
4. The molar volumes of α and β phases are given as 7.377 cm³ and 7.317 cm³, respectively.
5. The difference in molar volumes (ΔV) is assumed to be independent of pressure.

We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to relate the pressure and temperature at which the transformation occurs:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change.

Since the transformation is isothermal, ΔT = 0, and ΔS = 0. Therefore, ΔG = ΔH.

At the initial pressure (1 atm) and temperature (773 K), the Gibbs free energy change is zero, meaning that the transformation is spontaneous:

ΔG = 0 = 912 J/mol - (723 K) × ΔV

Rearranging the equation to solve for ΔV, we get:

ΔV = 912 J/mol / (723 K × 1 atm)

ΔV ≈ 1.26 cm³/mol

Now, we can use the ideal gas equation to relate the pressure and volume:

P1V1 = P2V2

where P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, and V1 and V2 are the initial and final volumes.

Rearranging the equation to solve for P2, we get:

P2 = P1 × (V1 / V2)

Substituting the values, we get:

P2 = 1 atm × (7.377 cm³/mol / 7.317 cm³/mol)

P2 ≈ 1.01 atm

Therefore, the pressure required for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is approximately 1 atm.

The wt.% of A in α and β phases is 70 and 20, respectively. The wt.% of B in the alloy is? (round off to nearest integer);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The ratio of weight percentages (wt.%) of α to β is 4, which means that the weight percentage of α is 4x and the weight percentage of β is x.
2. The weight percentage of A in α is 70, so the weight percentage of A in the entire α phase is 70% of 4x, which is 0.7(4x) = 2.8x.
3. The weight percentage of A in β is 20, so the weight percentage of A in the entire β phase is 20% of x, which is 0.2x.
4. The total weight percentage of A in the alloy is the sum of the weight percentages of A in α and β: 2.8x + 0.2x = 2.8x + 0.2x = 3x.
5. The total weight percentage of A in the alloy is 70, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 70.
6. Solving for x, we get: x = 70/3 = 23.33.
7. Since x is the weight percentage of β, the weight percentage of β is 23.33.
8. The weight percentage of B is the difference between 100 and the sum of the weight percentages of α and β: 100 - (4x + x) = 100 - (5x) = 100 - 5(23.33) = 100 - 116.65 = -16.65.
9. Since the weight percentage of B cannot be negative, we take the absolute value: |-16.65| = 16.65.

The density of hcp Ti is given as 4.51 g/cm³. We can use this to find the atomic volume of hcp Ti:

Atomic volume = Molar mass / Density
= 47.9 g/mol / 4.51 g/cm³
= 10.57 cm³/mol

The lattice parameter of bcc Ti is given as 0.332 nm. We can use this to find the atomic volume of bcc Ti:

Atomic volume = (4/3) \* π \* (Lattice parameter)³
= (4/3) \* π \* (0.332 nm)³
= 11.13 cm³/mol

The volume change accompanying the transformation is the difference between the atomic volumes of the two phases:

Volume change = Atomic volume (bcc) - Atomic volume (hcp)
= 11.13 cm³/mol - 10.57 cm³/mol
= 0.56 cm³/mol

To find the percentage volume change, we can use the following formula:

The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is? (round off to 2 decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in volume of the graphite sample when it is heated from 900 K to 1100 K.

First, we need to calculate the linear thermal expansion coefficients at 900 K. We can do this by assuming that the thermal expansion coefficient is linearly dependent on temperature, and using the given values at 1000 K:

α_parallel = 0.8 × 10^(-6) K^-1
α_perpendicular = 29 × 10^(-6) K^-1

At 900 K, the thermal expansion coefficients will be:

α_parallel = 0.8 × 10^(-6) K^-1 × (1000 K / 900 K) = 0.889 × 10^(-6) K^-1
α_perpendicular = 29 × 10^(-6) K^-1 × (1000 K / 900 K) = 32.22 × 10^(-6) K^-1

Now, we can calculate the change in length of the graphite sample in the parallel and perpendicular directions:

ΔL_parallel = L × α_parallel × ΔT = L × 0.889 × 10^(-6) K^-1 × (1100 K - 900 K) = 0.889 × 10^(-6) L K^-1 × 200 K
ΔL_perpendicular = L × α_perpendicular × ΔT = L × 32.22 × 10^(-6) K^-1 × (1100 K - 900 K) = 32.22 × 10^(-6) L K^-1 × 200 K

The change in volume of the graphite sample is the product of the change in length in the parallel and perpendicular directions:

ΔV = ΔL_parallel × ΔL_perpendicular = (0.889 × 10^(-6) L K^-1 × 200 K) × (32.22 × 10^(-6) L K^-1 × 200 K) = 5.67 × 10^(-12) L^2 K^-2

The percentage increase in volume is:

ΔV / V × 100% = (5.67 × 10^(-12) L^2 K^-2) / V × 100% ≈ 0.57%

The green compact has 18 volume percent porosity. For a sintered cube of side 2 cm, the required side of the cubic green compact in cm is? (round off to 2 decimal places);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The theoretical density of the ceramic is 6.76 g/cm³.
2. The sintered density of the ceramic is 6.60 g/cm³, which means that the ceramic has a porosity of 2.16% (100% - 97.84% = 2.16%).
3. The green compact has 18% porosity, which means that the volume of the green compact is 82% of the volume of the sintered ceramic (100% - 18% = 82%).
4. Let the side length of the green compact be x cm. Then, the volume of the green compact is x³ cm³.
5. The volume of the sintered ceramic is 6.60 g/cm³ × (2 cm)³ = 32.64 cm³.
6. Since the volume of the green compact is 82% of the volume of the sintered ceramic, we can set up the equation:

The dielectric constant of a material at ultraviolet frequencies is mainly due to electronic polarizability, which is the ability of the material's electrons to be displaced by an electric field. This is because the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum corresponds to energies that are high enough to excite the electrons in the material, causing them to become polarized.

(A) Dipolar polarizability refers to the ability of a material to become polarized due to the alignment of permanent dipoles. This is important at lower frequencies, such as in the infrared region, but is less significant at ultraviolet frequencies.

This is important in materials with high concentrations of ions, such as ionic solids, but is less significant in materials with covalent bonds, such as most organic materials.

(C) yield of BSE is lower

Explanation:

* In scanning electron microscopy (SEM), two types of signals can be used to produce images: secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE).
* Secondary electrons are emitted from the sample surface when it is bombarded with a focused beam of electrons. The energy of these secondary electrons is limited, allowing for detailed topographic imaging with high resolution.
* Backscattered electrons, on the other hand, are electrons that are scattered from the sample surface and back to the detector, often without interacting with the sample surface. This interaction is less energetic, resulting in a poorer resolution compared to secondary electron imaging.
* The option stating ""energy of BSE is lower"" is incorrect because the energy of BSEs is actually higher than that of SEs.
* The option stating ""sampling volume of BSE is larger"" is incorrect because the sampling volume of BSEs is actually smaller than that of SEs.
* The option stating ""sampling volume of SE is larger"" is incorrect because the sampling volume of SEs is actually larger than that of BSEs.

The other options are not correct because:

When a metal is cooled rapidly, it can form solid nuclei at a lower temperature than its equilibrium melting point. This is because the rapid cooling process creates a supersaturated solution of the metal, which can then nucleate and grow into a solid.

The critical size of the solid nuclei is the minimum size required for the nucleus to be stable and grow into a solid. The critical size is determined by the energy barrier that must be overcome for the nucleus to form.

In this problem, the metal can solidify at three different temperatures: 500 °C, 400 °C, and 300 °C. The critical size of the solid nuclei will be different for each of these temperatures.

At 500 °C, the metal is cooled slowly, and the solid nuclei have time to form and grow to a larger size before the metal solidifies. Therefore, the critical size of the solid nuclei is larger for solidification at 500 °C.

At 400 °C, the metal is cooled more rapidly, and the solid nuclei have less time to form and grow. Therefore, the critical size of the solid nuclei is smaller for solidification at 400 °C.

At 300 °C, the metal is cooled even more rapidly, and the solid nuclei have even less time to form and grow. Therefore, the critical size of the solid nuclei is the smallest for solidification at 300 °C.

The intensity of magnetization in $Am^(−1)$ is? (round off to 3 decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for magnetic moment:

M = V × B

where M is the magnetic moment, V is the volume of the magnet, and B is the magnetic induction intensity.

Given values:

M = 4.2 × 10^(-7) Am^2
m = 50 g = 0.05 kg (convert mass to kg)
ρ = 7.2 g/cm^3 = 7.2 × 10^3 kg/m^3 (convert density to kg/m^3)
V = m / ρ = 0.05 kg / (7.2 × 10^3 kg/m^3) ≈ 6.94 × 10^(-5) m^3

Now, plug in the values to calculate the magnetic induction intensity:

B = M / V
= (4.2 × 10^(-7) Am^2) / (6.94 × 10^(-5) m^3)
≈ 0.608 Am^(-1)

(B) Glass has lower enthalpy than both the corresponding crystalline and liquid phases

Explanation:

* Enthalpy (H) is a measure of the total energy of a system, including both internal energy (U) and pV, where p is pressure and V is volume.
* In the glass transition region, the glass has a lower enthalpy than the corresponding crystalline phase because the glass has a more disordered structure, which requires less energy to maintain.
* The glass also has a lower enthalpy than the corresponding liquid phase because the glass is in a more ordered state, with a more rigid and less dynamic structure, which requires less energy to maintain.

(D) first decreases and then increases

Here's a brief explanation:

During the aging process of an Al-Cu alloy, the hardness of the alloy initially decreases due to the formation of Guinier-Preston (GP) zones. These zones are coherent with the matrix and are relatively soft. As the aging time increases, the GP zones coarsen and transform into larger, less coherent precipitates, such as theta' (Al2Cu) or theta (Al2Cu) phases. These precipitates are harder than the GP zones and contribute to an increase in the alloy's hardness.

Therefore, the hardness of the alloy first decreases due to the formation of GP zones and then increases as the precipitates coarsen and become more numerous.";D;C;0;

(A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing;"To avoid island growth and achieve a contiguous planar film, the student should:

(C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate

This is because:

* Increasing the substrate temperature can help to increase the surface mobility of the deposited atoms, allowing them to spread out and form a continuous film.
* Decreasing the deposition rate can help to reduce the likelihood of island growth by giving the deposited atoms more time to diffuse and spread out before new atoms are deposited.

The other options are not correct:

* (A) Choosing a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film may not necessarily prevent island growth.
* (B) Choosing a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with SiO2 may not affect the growth mode of the deposited film.
* (D) Intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing may not be effective in preventing island growth.

(A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases (B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases (C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically (D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged ;"Let's analyze the question:

For a diffusional transformation, such as the growth of β precipitates in an α matrix, the rate of transformation is influenced by the degree of undercooling.

Undercooling is the difference between the equilibrium temperature and the actual temperature. As the degree of undercooling increases, the driving force for the transformation also increases.

Now, let's examine the options:

(A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases: This is not correct. As the degree of undercooling increases, the rate of transformation should increase, not decrease.

(B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases: This is also not correct. The rate of transformation should increase with increasing undercooling, not decrease initially.

(C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically: This is correct. As the degree of undercooling increases, the thermodynamic driving force for the transformation also increases.

(D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged: This is not correct. As the degree of undercooling increases, the mobility of atoms in the α matrix may increase, allowing for faster diffusion and a higher rate of transformation.

(ii) Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B. (iii) The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β. (iv) Atomic mass of A is twice that of B. The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is? (Round off to one decimal) ;"Let's break down the given information:

1. Phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B, so the mole fraction of A in α is 0.5.
2. Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B, so the mole fraction of A in β is 2x and the mole fraction of B in β is x.
3. The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, so the total amount of A in the mixture is equal to the total amount of B in the mixture.
4. The atomic mass of A is twice that of B, so the molar mass of A is twice the molar mass of B.

Let's denote the total number of moles of A in the mixture as nA and the total number of moles of B in the mixture as nB. We can set up the following equation based on the information:

nA = 0.5nα + 2xnβ

where nα is the number of moles of A in phase α and nβ is the number of moles of B in phase β.

Since the two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, we can set up another equation:

nα = nβ

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

nA = 0.5nβ + 2xnβ

Simplifying the equation, we get:

nA = 2.5xnβ

Since the total number of moles of A in the mixture is equal to the total number of moles of B in the mixture, we can set up another equation:

nA = nB

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

2.5xnβ = nB

Since the mole fraction of A in the mixture is the ratio of the number of moles of A to the total number of moles in the mixture, we can calculate it as:

xA = nA / (nA + nB)

Substituting the expressions for nA and nB, we get:

xA = (2.5xnβ) / (2.5xnβ + nB)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

xA = 2.5x / (2.5x + 1)

Solving for xA, we get:

(Round off to 1 decimal).;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the diffusion coefficient (Da) at both 300 K and 600 K, and then use these values to find the time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K.

Given that Da = (Da)° * exp(-Ea/k_B T)

At 300 K:

Da(300 K) = (Da)° * exp(-(0.3 eV)/(8.62*10^(-5) eV/K * 300 K))

Da(300 K) = (Da)° * exp(-(0.3/0.025)) ≈ (Da)° * exp(-12.0)

At 600 K:

Da(600 K) = (Da)° * exp(-(0.3 eV)/(8.62*10^(-5) eV/K * 600 K))

Da(600 K) = (Da)° * exp(-(0.3/0.04166)) ≈ (Da)° * exp(-7.2)

Since the time taken for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 300 K is given as 1 hour, we can calculate the diffusion coefficient (Da) at 300 K:

Da(300 K) * (10 μm)^2 * 1 hour = Da(300 K) * 10^-4 m^2 * 3600 s

Da(300 K) ≈ 1.44*10^-11 m^2/s

Now, we can calculate the time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K:

[(Da(300 K)) / (Da(600 K))] * (10 μm)^2 * t = 10^-4 m^2

t ≈ [(1.44*10^-11) / (3.14*10^-11)] * (10^-4) * 3600 = 80.1 s

ρ = 3000 m
μ_e = 0.14 m^2/(V s)
μ_h = 0.06 m^2/(V s)

We can use the following equation to relate the resistivity to the number of charge carriers (n):

ρ = (1 / (n * μ_e * μ_h))

We can rearrange this equation to solve for n:

n = (1 / (ρ * μ_e * μ_h))

Substituting the given values, we get:

n = (1 / (3000 * 0.14 * 0.06)) = 6.43 * 10^22 m^-3

Now we can use the expression for n_e to find E_g:

n_e = (N_A) * exp(-E_g / (k_B * T))

Substituting the values, we get:

6.43 * 10^22 = (6.02 * 10^23) * exp(-E_g / (8.62 * 10^-5 * 298))

In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the Beer-Lambert law, which describes the relationship between the absorption coefficient, the thickness of the material, and the fraction of light transmitted through the material.

The Beer-Lambert law states that the fraction of light transmitted through the material is given by:

I/I0 = e^(-αx)

where I is the intensity of the transmitted light, I0 is the intensity of the incident light, α is the absorption coefficient, and x is the thickness of the material.

In this case, the thickness of the glass panel is 5 mm, and the absorption coefficient can be changed from 0.3 cm^-1 to 1 cm^-1. We can rewrite the Beer-Lambert law in terms of the fraction of light transmitted, F, as:

F = e^(-αx)

where F is the fraction of light transmitted.

We can then calculate the fraction of light transmitted for the minimum and maximum absorption coefficients:

Minimum absorption coefficient (α = 0.3 cm^-1):
F_min = e^(-0.3 x 5) = 0.674

Maximum absorption coefficient (α = 1 cm^-1):
F_max = e^(-1 x 5) = 0.135

The ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of light transmitted is:

The wavelength of the monochromatic X-ray beam is 1.54 Å. Considering first-order reflection, the lattice parameter(in Å) of the crystal is? (Round off to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation, which relates the wavelength of the X-ray beam, the lattice parameter of the crystal, and the angle of diffraction:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where n is the order of the reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray beam, d is the lattice parameter of the crystal, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

We are given that the third peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern corresponds to a 2θ value of 45°, which means that the angle of diffraction is 22.5° (since 2θ = 45°). We are also given that the wavelength of the X-ray beam is 1.54 Å.

We can rearrange the Bragg equation to solve for d:

d = λ / (2 sin(θ))

(C) No change in enthalpy, but change in the entropy

Explanation:

In an ideal rubber, the primary factor responsible for elasticity up to small strains is the change in entropy (S) rather than enthalpy (H). This is because the rubber molecules are able to reorganize themselves and return to their original shape when the stress is removed, resulting in a change in entropy. This change in entropy is the primary driving force for the elastic behavior of the rubber.

In contrast, a change in enthalpy would require a change in the internal energy (U) of the system, which is not the case for ideal rubber.

where N is the number of defects (oxygen vacancies in this case), N0 is the total number of sites available for defects, ΔH is the enthalpy required to create a defect, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given that ΔH = 4 eV, which is equivalent to 4 \* 1.602 \* 10^-19 J. We are also given that T = 1000 K.

N0 is the total number of oxygen sites in a mole of CeO2. The formula for CeO2 is Ce2O3, which means that there are 3 oxygen atoms per formula unit. The molar mass of CeO2 is 172.12 g/mol, which means that there are 6.022 \* 10^23 formula units per mole. Therefore, there are:

N0 = 6.022 \* 10^23 formula units/mol \* 3 oxygen atoms/formula unit = 1.806 \* 10^24 oxygen atoms/mol

Now we can plug in the values into the Boltzmann distribution:

N = 1.806 \* 10^24 oxygen atoms/mol \* exp(-6.408 \* 10^-19 J / (8.62 \* 10^-5 eV/K \* 1000 K))

Using a calculator or computer algebra system, we get:

N ≈ 1.34 \* 10^21 oxygen vacancies/mol

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is:

Electrical Properties;9;G-XEC-2022-9;NUM;53;Given: E° ($Li^(+)$/Li) = -3.04 V versus Standard Hydrogen Electrode, E° ($Zn^(2+)$/Zn) = -0.77 V versus Standard Hydrogen Electrode. An electrochemical reaction is known to occur at +4.50 V against a $Li^(+)$/Li reference electrode. The potential(in volts) of the same reaction against a $Zn^(2+)$/Zn reference electrode is? (Round off to two decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the Nernst equation to relate the potential of the reaction to the standard potential and the concentration of ions.

The Nernst equation is:

E = E° + (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)

where E is the potential of the reaction, E° is the standard potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

Since we are given the potential of the reaction against a Li+/Li reference electrode, we can use the Nernst equation to find the reaction quotient:

E = 4.50 V = E° + (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for Q:

Q = exp((E - E°) \* nF/RT)

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Q = exp((4.50 - (-3.04)) \* 1F/RT) = exp(7.54 F/RT)

Now, we can use the Nernst equation again to find the potential of the reaction against a Zn2+/Zn reference electrode:

E = E° + (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

E = -0.77 V + (RT/2F) \* ln(Q)

Substituting the value of Q we found earlier, we get:

E = -0.77 V + (RT/2F) \* ln(exp(7.54 F/RT)) = -0.77 V + (RT/2F) \* 7.54

Simplifying, we get:

E = -0.77 V + 3.77 V = 3.00 V

Rounding off to two decimal places, the answer is:
