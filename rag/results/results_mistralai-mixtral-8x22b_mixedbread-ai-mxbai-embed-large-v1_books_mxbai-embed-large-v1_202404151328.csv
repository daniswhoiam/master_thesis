Thermodynamics,1,G-XEC-2012-4,MCQS,28,Which of the following signals is produced due to the elastic scattering of electrons by a material?  (A) Secondary electron (B) Backscattered electron (C) Auger electron (D) Photoelectron,"

The correct answer is (B) Backscattered electron.

Explanation:

Backscattered electrons are produced due to the elastic scattering of electrons by a material. In elastic scattering, the incident electrons interact with the nuclei of the atoms in the material, resulting in a change in the direction of the electrons without a significant loss of energy. The backscattered electrons have energies close to the incident electron energy and can be used to obtain information about the composition and topography of the material.

Secondary electrons, Auger electrons, and photoelectrons are produced due to inelastic scattering, where the incident electrons lose energy and excite the atoms in the material.

Thermodynamics,3,G-XEC-2012-7,MCQS,19,Which material has the lowest specific heat capacity at room temperature?  (A) Water (B) Mercury (C) Copper (D) Silver,"

The correct answer is (B) Mercury.

Explanation:

Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius. The specific heat capacity of a material depends on its molecular structure and the type of bonds between its atoms.

At room temperature, the specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g°C, the specific heat capacity of mercury is 0.139 J/g°C, the specific heat capacity of copper is 0.385 J/g°C, and the specific heat capacity of silver is 0.235 J/g°C.

Therefore, mercury has the lowest specific heat capacity at room temperature.

Thermodynamics,4,G-XEC-2013-15,NUM,29,"The band gap of a semiconducting material used to make an LED is 1.43 eV. What will be the minimum wavelength ofthe radiation emitted by this LED, in μm?","

The band gap of a semiconducting material used to make an LED is 1.43 eV. What will be the minimum wavelength ofthe radiation emitted by this LED, in μm?

Answer:

The minimum wavelength of the radiation emitted by the LED can be calculated using the formula:

λ = hc/E

where λ is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and E is the energy of the photon.

In this case, the energy of the photon is equal to the band gap of the semiconducting material, which is 1.43 eV.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

λ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.43 eV * 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV)

λ = 0.86 μm

Therefore, the minimum wavelength of the radiation emitted by the LED is 0.86 μm.

The correct answer is (D) minority carrier concentration much less than majority carrier concentration.

Explanation:

In a forward biased p-n junction, the minority carrier concentration is much less than the majority carrier concentration. This is because the forward biasing of the junction causes the majority carriers to flow across the junction, while the minority carriers are blocked by the potential barrier.

The final temperature of water in the copper cup can be calculated using the principle of conservation of energy.

Let's denote the final temperature of water as T_final.

The heat gained by the water in the cup is:

Q_water = m_water * c_water * (T_final - 4)

The heat lost by the copper cup is:

Q_copper = m_copper * c_copper * (T_final - 4)

The heat gained by the added water is:

Q_added_water = m_added_water * c_water * (90 - T_final)

Since the system is isolated, the total heat gained must be equal to the total heat lost:

Q_water + Q_copper + Q_added_water = 0

Substituting the values, we get:

(80 * 4.18 * (T_final - 4)) + (140 * 0.385 * (T_final - 4)) + (100 * 4.18 * (90 - T_final)) = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

334.4 * T_final - 1337.6 + 53.9 * T_final - 215.6 + 37620 - 418 * T_final = 0

Solving for T_final, we get:

T_final = 37620 / (334.4 + 53.9 - 418)

T_final = 37620 / 373.3

T_final = 100.78 °C

Therefore, the final temperature of water in the copper cup is approximately 100.78 °C.

Thermodynamics,8,G-XEC-2014-17,MCQS-NUM,44,"The energy in eV and the wavelength in μm, respectively, of the photon emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom falls from n = 4 to n = 2 state is  (A) 3.0, 0.413 (B) 2.55, 0.365 (C) 2.75, 0.451 (D) 2.55, 0.487","

The correct answer is: (B) 2.55, 0.365

Explanation:

The energy of the photon emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom falls from n = 4 to n = 2 state can be calculated using the following formula:

E = (13.6 eV) * (1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2)

where n_f is the final energy level (n = 2) and n_i is the initial energy level (n = 4).

Plugging in the values, we get:

E = (13.6 eV) * (1/2^2 - 1/4^2) = 2.55 eV

The wavelength of the photon can be calculated using the following formula:

λ = hc/E

where h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and E is the energy of the photon in Joules.

Converting 2.55 eV to Joules, we get:

E = 2.55 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 4.086 x 10^-19 J

Plugging in the values, we get:

λ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.086 x 10^-19 J) = 4.86 x 10^-7 m = 0.486 μm

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2.55, 0.365.

The correct answer is (B).

Explanation:

The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor is given by:

$$\sigma = nq\mu_n + pq\mu_p$$

where $n$ and $p$ are the electron and hole concentrations, respectively, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $\mu_n$ and $\mu_p$ are the electron and hole mobilities, respectively.

The electron and hole concentrations are given by:

$$n = N_C e^{-(E_C - E_F)/kT}$$

$$p = N_V e^{-(E_F - E_V)/kT}$$

where $N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively, $E_C$ and $E_V$ are the energies of the conduction and valence band edges, respectively, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

The Fermi level in an intrinsic semiconductor is given by:

$$E_F = \frac{E_C + E_V}{2} + \frac{kT}{2} \ln \frac{N_V}{N_C}$$

Substituting this into the expressions for $n$ and $p$, we get:

$$n = N_C e^{-(E_C - E_V)/2kT} e^{-(kT/2) \ln (N_V/N_C)}$$

$$p = N_V e^{-(E_C - E_V)/2kT} e^{(kT/2) \ln (N_V/N_C)}$$

The conductivity is then given by:

$$\sigma = q(N_C \mu_n + N_V \mu_p) e^{-(E_C - E_V)/2kT} e^{-(kT/2) \ln (N_V/N_C)}$$

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

$$\ln \sigma = \ln q + \ln (N_C \mu_n + N_V \mu_p) - \frac{E_C - E_V}{2kT} - \frac{kT}{2} \ln \frac{N_V}{N_C}$$

Differentiating with respect to $1/T$, we get:

$$\frac{d \ln \sigma}{d(1/T)} = \frac{E_C - E_V}{2k} + \frac{kT^2}{2} \ln \frac{N_V}{N_C}$$

Since $E_C - E_V$ is the energy gap $E_g$, we have:

$$\frac{d \ln \sigma}{d(1/T)} = \frac{E_g}{2k} + \frac{kT^2}{2} \ln \frac{N_V}{N_C}$$

The second term on the right-hand side is usually small compared to the first term, so we can neglect it. Therefore, the slope of the graph of $\ln \sigma$ versus $1/T$ is approximately $E_g/2k$.

Since the slope is negative, the correct answer is (B).

The correct answer is (D) at all intensities, as long as the wavelength of the incident radiation is above a threshold value.

Explanation:

In the photoelectric effect, electrons are ejected from a metal surface when it is exposed to electromagnetic radiation of a certain frequency. The energy of the ejected electrons is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident radiation, and is independent of the intensity of the radiation.

The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of the incident radiation required to eject electrons from the metal surface. If the frequency of the incident radiation is below the threshold frequency, no electrons will be ejected, regardless of the intensity of the radiation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) at all intensities, as long as the wavelength of the incident radiation is above a threshold value.

During homogeneous solidification of a liquid metal, the radius of critical nucleus(in nanometer, nm) at a temperature $T_s$ which is below the melting point($T_m$), is ? (round-off to one decimal place).","

The radius of the critical nucleus during homogeneous solidification of a liquid metal can be calculated using the following equation:

r* = -2γ_sl / ΔG_v

where r* is the radius of the critical nucleus, γ_sl is the solid-liquid interfacial energy, and ΔG_v is the change in volume free energy upon transformation from liquid to solid.

Substituting the given values, we get:

r* = -2 * 0.18 * 10^(-2) / (0.18 * 10^(9) * 10^(-3))

r* = -2 * 10^(-3) / 1.8 * 10^(6)

r* = -1.11 * 10^(-9) m

r* = -1.11 nm

Therefore, the radius of the critical nucleus during homogeneous solidification of a liquid metal is -1.11 nm.

The correct answer is (B) smaller for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C.

Explanation:

The critical size of the solid nuclei is inversely proportional to the degree of undercooling. As the degree of undercooling increases, the critical size of the solid nuclei decreases.

In this case, the metal has a melting point of 600 °C. By rapid cooling, liquid metal can be made to solidify either at 500 °C or 400 °C or 300 °C.

The degree of undercooling for solidification at 500 °C is 100 °C, for solidification at 400 °C is 200 °C, and for solidification at 300 °C is 300 °C.

Therefore, the critical size of the solid nuclei is the smallest for solidification at 300 °C, followed by solidification at 400 °C, and the largest for solidification at 500 °C.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) smaller for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C.

The correct answer is (C) Glass has higher entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and lower entropy than the corresponding liquid phase.

Explanation:

Glass is a non-crystalline solid that is formed when a liquid is cooled rapidly enough to prevent the formation of a crystalline structure. At the glass transition temperature, the liquid becomes a glass, and its properties change.

Below the glass transition temperature, the glass has a higher entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase because the glass has a more disordered structure. However, the glass has a lower entropy than the corresponding liquid phase because the liquid has a more disordered structure.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Glass has higher entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and lower entropy than the corresponding liquid phase.

Thermodynamics,31,G-XEC-2015-56-13,NUM,41,What is the thickness (in µm) of a germanium crystal layer that would be required for absorbing 80% of the incident radiation whose wavelength is 1.3 µm? The absorption coefficient (α) of germanium at 1.3 µm is 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$.,"

The thickness of the germanium crystal layer required to absorb 80% of the incident radiation can be calculated using the Beer-Lambert law, which relates the intensity of light transmitted through a material to the thickness of the material and the absorption coefficient.

The Beer-Lambert law is given by:

I = I0 * exp(-α * d)

where:

I is the intensity of the transmitted light
I0 is the intensity of the incident light
α is the absorption coefficient
d is the thickness of the material

To calculate the thickness required to absorb 80% of the incident radiation, we can rearrange the Beer-Lambert law to solve for d:

d = -ln(I/I0) / α

Substituting the given values, we have:

    Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: 0.5 nm to 21.49 nm. It should be noted that the broad size distribution in the initial state would be changed to the monodisperse state as far as the average size of particles grows fr om 0.5 nm to 21.49 nm regardless of the growth rate. Additional simulation was performed with the initial average radii of 1 nm and 2 nm. The final average particle radii reaching the monodisperse state were 41.18 nm and 81.02 nm, respectively. These results can explain the natural evolution of monodisperse distribution of particles with growth. However, the results indicate that the minimum average radius for the monodisperse distribution should be about 20 nm when starting from the average radius of 0.5 nm, which is implicitly assumed to be the critical nucleus size.

The uncertainty in the position of the electron can be calculated using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in the position and momentum of a particle is at least equal to Planck's constant divided by 4π.

The uncertainty in the momentum of the electron can be calculated using the formula for momentum, which is p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron and v is its speed. The uncertainty in the momentum is then Δp = mΔv, where Δv is the uncertainty in the speed.

Substituting the given values into the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we have:

Δx * Δp ≥ h / 4π

Δx * mΔv ≥ h / 4π

Δx ≥ h / (4π * mΔv)

- Universal Gas Constant: 8.314 J.K^-1.mol^-1
- Temperature: 300 °C (573.15 K)

To calculate the number of Schottky defects per mole of KCl at 300 °C under equilibrium condition, we can use the following formula:

N = N_A * exp(-E_a / (RT))

The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is? (round off to 2 decimal places)","

The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K can be calculated using the formula for volume expansion:

$$\Delta V = \beta V_0 \Delta T$$

where $\Delta V$ is the change in volume, $\beta$ is the volume expansion coefficient, $V_0$ is the initial volume, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

The volume expansion coefficient $\beta$ can be calculated from the linear thermal expansion coefficients $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ using the formula:

$$\beta = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\beta = 0.8 \times 10^{-6} + 29 \times 10^{-6} = 29.8 \times 10^{-6} K^{-1}$$

Now, we can calculate the change in volume:

$$\Delta V = 29.8 \times 10^{-6} \times V_0 \times (1100 - 900) = 29.8 \times 10^{-6} \times V_0 \times 200$$

To find the percentage increase in volume, we divide the change in volume by the initial volume and multiply by 100:

$$\text{Percentage increase in volume} = \frac{\Delta V}{V_0} \times 100 = 29.8 \times 10^{-6} \times 200 \times 100 = 0.596\%$$

Therefore, the percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is approximately 0.596%.

The correct answer is (D).

Explanation:

The question is asking about the steps that are in the right direction for depositing a thin metallic film on a $SiO_2$ substrate with an adhesion layer between the metal film and substrate, in a contiguous planar fashion. Island type of growth must be avoided.

Option (A) is incorrect because the interfacial energy between the metallic adhesion layer and the deposited thin film is not the only factor that affects the growth mode. The interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the substrate, as well as the deposition conditions, also play a role.

Option (B) is incorrect because the interfacial energy between the metallic adhesion layer and the $SiO_2$ substrate is not the only factor that affects the growth mode. The interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the deposited thin film, as well as the deposition conditions, also play a role.

Option (C) is incorrect because increasing the substrate temperature and decreasing the deposition rate can lead to island type of growth, which is to be avoided.

Option (D) is correct because using intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing can help to improve the adhesion between the metallic adhesion layer and the $SiO_2$ substrate, as well as the deposited thin film. This can help to avoid island type of growth and promote contiguous planar growth.

Here are some additional details:

- The interfacial energy between the metallic adhesion layer and the $SiO_2$ substrate is an important factor that affects the growth mode. A low interfacial energy can help to promote contiguous planar growth.
- The interfacial energy between the metallic adhesion layer and the deposited thin film is also an important factor that affects the growth mode. A low interfacial energy can help to promote contiguous planar growth.
- The deposition conditions, such as the substrate temperature and the deposition rate, can also affect the growth mode. Increasing the substrate temperature and decreasing the deposition rate can lead to island type of growth, which is to be avoided.
- Using intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing can help to improve the adhesion between the metallic adhesion layer and the $SiO_2$ substrate, as well as the deposited thin film. This can help to avoid island type of growth and promote contiguous planar growth.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

$ln(n_e) = ln(N_A) - {E_g/k_(B)T}$

Rearranging the equation, we have:

$E_g = k_(B)T * (ln(N_A) - ln(n_e))$

Now, we need to find the value of $n_e$. We can use the relation between resistivity ($\rho$), mobility ($\mu$), and carrier concentration ($n$) for a semiconductor:

$\rho = 1 / (e * (n_e * \mu_e + n_h * \mu_h))$

Since the semiconductor is pure, we can assume that the number of electrons ($n_e$) and holes ($n_h$) are equal. Therefore, we have:

$\rho = 1 / (e * n_e * (\mu_e + \mu_h))$

Rearranging the equation, we get:

$n_e = 1 / (e * \rho * (\mu_e + \mu_h))$

Substituting the given values, we have:

$n_e = 1 / (1.60 * 10^(-19) * 3000 * (0.14 + 0.06))$

$n_e = 1.25 * 10^(16) m^(-3)$

Now, we can calculate the band gap ($E_g$) using the equation:

$E_g = k_(B)T * (ln(N_A) - ln(n_e))$

Substituting the values, we get:

$E_g = 8.62 * 10^(-5) * 298 * (ln(6.02 * 10^(23)) - ln(1.25 * 10^(16)))$

$E_g = 0.72 eV$

Therefore, the band gap of the semiconductor is approximately 0.72 eV.

Assuming that the liquid-solid interface is at the melting temperature, the temperature from the interface into the liquid  (A) Decreases (B) Increases (C) Remains constant (D) Increases and then decreases","

The correct answer is (A) Decreases.

Explanation:

During the solidification of a pure metal, dendrites are formed when the temperature from the interface into the liquid decreases. This is because the temperature gradient in the liquid is negative, which causes the interface to become unstable and dendritic protrusions to grow rapidly into the undercooled liquid.

Here are some relevant passages from the given context:

- ""A planar interface becomes unstable. Dendritic protrusions (spikes) grow rapidly into the undercooled liquid, which quickly absorbs their evolved latent heat. Thermal undercooling is thus an essential prerequisite for dendritic growth; this form of growth becomes more and more likely as the degree of thermal undercooling increases.""

- ""When solidification commences at the flat surface of a metallic ingot mould there is usually an inverse temperature gradient in the solid. If the temperature of the liquid is lower than the solid, then small protuberances can grow because latent heat is extracted through the melt, which is at lower temperature. The solidification front becomes unstable.""

- ""For lower gradients or slower rates of growth, the instability leads to a mode of growth called cellular growth; uniformly spaced projections, or cells, form and grow outward in the direction of heat extraction. For steeper gradients or faster growth rates, the mode of growth becomes dendritic. Protuberances form and extend into the melt. Then an instability again occurs at the new solidification fronts and additional protuberances form. Eventually, a tree-like structure called a dendrite forms.""

- ""Dendrite formation in pure metals requires this inverse temperature gradient. Once the normal solidification temperature is attained, growth proceeds by thickening of cells and dendrites that takes place by heat dissipation from the bulk of the liquid.""

- ""Dendritic growth is complicated by the process of coarsening that involves competitive dissolution and growth and leads to thickening of larger dendrite arms at the expense of smaller ones.""

- ""Dendrite multiplication is now recognized as an important source of crystals in castings and ingots.""

- ""In practice, freezing often commences at the plane surface of a mould under more complex and constrained conditions, with crystals growing counter to the general direction of heat flow. The morphology of the interface, as well as the final grain structure of the casting, are then decided by thermal conditions.""

The correct answer is (B) F is zero and U is minimum.

Explanation:

At equilibrium spacing in a crystalline solid, the net inter-atomic force (F) is zero, and the potential energy (U) is at its minimum value. This is because the atoms in the crystal are in a stable configuration, where the attractive and repulsive forces between them are balanced.

The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all the atoms in the crystal. At equilibrium, the potential energy is at its minimum value, which means that the atoms are in their lowest energy state.

The correct answer is (D) 847.5 K.

Explanation:

The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant (k) of a chemical reaction to the temperature (T) and the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction. The equation is given by:

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

where A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

To find the temperature at which the reaction rate is tripled, we can use the following equation:

k2/k1 = e^((Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2))

where k1 and k2 are the initial and final reaction rates, respectively, and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures, respectively.

In this case, we know that k2/k1 = 3, Ea = 8.314 kJ/mol, and T1 = 300 K. We can solve for T2 as follows:

3 = e^((8.314/8.314)(1/300 - 1/T2))

ln(3) = (1/300 - 1/T2)

1/T2 = 1/300 - ln(3)

T2 = 1/(1/300 - ln(3))

T2 = 847.5 K

Therefore, the temperature at which the reaction rate is tripled is 847.5 K.

The correct answer is (C) 0.44.

Explanation:

The given equation for the reduction of FeO with CO gas in co-current flow is:

FeO + CO = Fe + $CO_2$

The standard Gibbs free energy change (∆G°) for this reaction at 1173 K is given as 8120 J.

To determine the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$, we can use the following equation:

$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2) = e^(-∆G°/RT)$

where:

$p_(CO)$ is the partial pressure of CO
$p_(CO_2)$ is the partial pressure of $CO_2$
R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)
T is the temperature in Kelvin (1173 K)

Substituting the values into the equation, we get:

$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2) = e^(-8120/(8.314 * 1173))$

$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2) = 0.44$

Therefore, the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ for the reduction of FeO with CO gas in co-current flow at 1173 K is 0.44.

The activity of Q in a liquid Q-R alloy can be calculated using the following equation:

a_Q = 𝛾_Q * x_Q

where 𝛾_Q is the activity coefficient of Q, and x_Q is the mole fraction of Q in the alloy.

To calculate the activity of Q in an alloy of composition x_R = 0.6, we first need to calculate the mole fraction of Q in the alloy. Since x_R + x_Q = 1, we have:

x_Q = 1 - x_R = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

Next, we can calculate the activity coefficient of Q using the given equation:

ln 𝛾_Q = 0.6 * (x_R)^2 - 0.2 * (x_R)^3

Substituting x_R = 0.6, we get:

ln 𝛾_Q = 0.6 * (0.6)^2 - 0.2 * (0.6)^3 = 0.1872

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

𝛾_Q = e^0.1872 = 1.206

Finally, we can calculate the activity of Q using the equation a_Q = 𝛾_Q * x_Q:

a_Q = 1.206 * 0.4 = 0.4824

Therefore, the activity of Q in an alloy of composition x_R = 0.6 at the given temperature is 0.4824.

The correct answer is (B) ∆S° is negative.

Explanation:

In an Ellingham diagram, the standard free energy change ∆𝐺° for the oxidation reaction of a metal M is plotted as a function of temperature. The slope of this line is positive because the standard entropy change ∆S° for the reaction is negative.

The standard free energy change ∆𝐺° for a reaction is given by:

∆𝐺° = ∆𝐻° - 𝑇∆𝑆°

where ∆𝐻° is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction and ∆𝑆° is the standard entropy change for the reaction.

In the case of the oxidation reaction of a metal M, the standard entropy change ∆𝑆° is negative because the reaction involves the conversion of a solid metal M and a gas $𝑂_2$ to a solid metal oxide $𝑀_(𝑥)𝑂_2$. The entropy of a solid is lower than the entropy of a gas, so the overall entropy change for the reaction is negative.

Since ∆𝑆° is negative, the slope of the line in the Ellingham diagram is positive. This is because the standard free energy change ∆𝐺° is a function of temperature, and the slope of the line is given by:

The configurational entropy due to ideal mixing in a binary A-B system is given by:

∆S_(mix) = -R*(X_A*ln[X_A] + X_B*ln[X_B])

where X_A and X_B are the mole fractions of A and B, respectively.

To find the maximum value of ∆S_(mix), we can differentiate the equation with respect to X_A and set it equal to zero:

d/dx (∆S_(mix)) = -R*(ln[X_A] + 1 - ln[X_B] - 1) = 0

Simplifying, we get:

ln[X_A] = ln[X_B]

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

X_A = X_B

Since X_A + X_B = 1, we can solve for X_A:

Applying Third law of thermodynamics, the value of entropy (in $J.K^(-1)$) of transformation of 368.5 K is ?(answer up to two decimal places)","

The given information is:

- Entropy change associated with heating orthorhombic sulfur from 0K to 368.5 K: 36.86 J.K^(-1)
- Entropy change associated with cooling monoclinic sulfur from 368.5K to 0 K: -37.8 J.K^(-1)
- Pure orthorhombic sulfur transforms to stable monoclinic sulfur above 368.5K.

To apply the Third Law of Thermodynamics, we need to consider the entropy change associated with the transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5 K.

Let's denote the entropy change associated with the transformation as ΔS_trans.

According to the Third Law of Thermodynamics, the entropy change associated with the transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5 K is given by:

ΔS_trans = ΔS_heating + ΔS_cooling

Substituting the given values, we have:

ΔS_trans = 36.86 J.K^(-1) + (-37.8 J.K^(-1))

Simplifying, we get:

ΔS_trans = -0.94 J.K^(-1)

Therefore, the value of entropy (in J.K^(-1)) of transformation of 368.5 K is -0.94 J.K^(-1).

- W-Ni compact is prepared by liquid phase sintering at 1500° C.
- The size of tungsten grains is 40 µm.
- The interfacial tungsten -tungsten and tungsten- nickel energies are 0.52 and 0.30 $J.m^(-2)$ respectively.

The question is:

- The predicted average neck size (in µm) of sintered tungsten grain is:

To answer this question, we need to calculate the average neck size of the sintered tungsten grain. The neck size is the distance between the centers of two adjacent tungsten grains.

The neck size can be calculated using the following formula:

$d = \frac{2\gamma_{W-W}}{r}$

where:

- $d$ is the neck size (in µm).
- $\gamma_{W-W}$ is the interfacial tungsten -tungsten energy (in $J.m^(-2)$).
- $r$ is the radius of the tungsten grain (in µm).

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

$d = \frac{2\times 0.52}{40} = 0.026$ µm

Therefore, the predicted average neck size of the sintered tungsten grain is 0.026 µm.

The correct answer is (D) 4.

Explanation:

The Gibbs phase rule states that the number of degrees of freedom (F) in a system is equal to the number of components (C) minus the number of phases (P) plus 2. In a three-component system, C = 3. At constant pressure, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced by 1, so F = C - P + 1.

To find the maximum number of phases, we can set F = 0 and solve for P:

0 = 3 - P + 1
P = 4

Therefore, the maximum number of phases in a three-component system at constant pressure is 4.

The molar free energy (J $mol^(-1)$) of a liquid solution of a binary A-B alloy as a function of temperature ( T ) and composition (x, the mole fraction of B) is given by: $G^(L)(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x) where $(G_(A))^(0,L)$ and $(G_(B))^(0,L)$ are the molar free energies of pure liquid A and pure liquid B.

The excess molar free energy, $𝐺^(XS,L)$, for an alloy with 𝑥 = 0.5 at 𝑇 = 1000 K can be calculated using the given equation for the molar free energy of a liquid solution of a binary A-B alloy.

The equation for the molar free energy of a liquid solution of a binary A-B alloy is:

$G^(L)(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x)

where $(G_(A))^(0,L)$ and $(G_(B))^(0,L)$ are the molar free energies of pure liquid A and pure liquid B, respectively.

To calculate the excess molar free energy, $𝐺^(XS,L)$, we need to subtract the molar free energy of the ideal solution from the molar free energy of the real solution. The molar free energy of the ideal solution is given by:

$G^(ideal)(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)]

Therefore, the excess molar free energy is:

$𝐺^(XS,L)$ = $G^(L)(T,x)$ - $G^(ideal)(T,x)$

Substituting the values for $G^(L)(T,x)$ and $G^(ideal)(T,x)$ into the equation for $𝐺^(XS,L)$, we get:

$𝐺^(XS,L)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x) - (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ - x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ - RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$𝐺^(XS,L)$ = 4000x(1-x)

Substituting the values for x and T, we get:

$𝐺^(XS,L)$ = 4000(0.5)(1-0.5)

$𝐺^(XS,L)$ = 1000 J $mol^(-1)$

Therefore, the excess molar free energy for an alloy with 𝑥 = 0.5 at 𝑇 = 1000 K is 1000 J $mol^(-1)$.

The correct answer is (A) 1000 J $mol^(-1)$.

Explanation:

The energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation of a spherical solid from the liquid is given by the Gibbs free energy change, which is a function of the interfacial energy between the solid and liquid phases.

The partial pressure of zinc(in torr, rounded off two decimal places) in equlibrium with liquid lead containing 0.03 mole % zinc at 900K is?","

The partial pressure of zinc in equilibrium with liquid lead containing 0.03 mole % zinc at 900K can be calculated using Henry's law.

According to Henry's law, the partial pressure of a gas in a solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the solution.

The mole fraction of zinc in the solution is 0.03/100 = 0.0003.

The partial pressure of zinc in the solution can be calculated as:

P_Zn = γ_Zn * x_Zn * p_(Zn)°

where P_Zn is the partial pressure of zinc, γ_Zn is the Henry's law coefficient for zinc, x_Zn is the mole fraction of zinc in the solution, and p_(Zn)° is the vapour pressure of pure zinc at 900K.

Substituting the given values, we get:

P_Zn = 8.55 * 0.0003 * 0.027 atm

P_Zn = 0.0006555 atm

Converting this to torr, we get:

P_Zn = 0.0006555 atm * 760 torr/atm

P_Zn = 0.498 torr

Therefore, the partial pressure of zinc in equilibrium with liquid lead containing 0.03 mole % zinc at 900K is 0.498 torr.

The correct answer is (D) 16 hours.

Explanation:

The time required for the center of a sphere to reach a certain temperature is inversely proportional to the thermal diffusivity of the material. Since the thermal diffusivity of sphere Y is 1/4th of that of sphere X, the time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K will be 4 times that of sphere X, which is 4 hours.

(B) Both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a]. (C) Both [a] and [r] are false.  (D) [a] is true but [r] is false. ","

The correct answer is (B) Both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a].

Explanation:

Assertion [a] is true. Low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often have additions of strong carbide-forming elements. These elements, such as chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium, form carbides that help to strengthen the steel and improve its creep resistance.

Reason [r] is also true. During creep deformation, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix, lose coherency. This means that the particles become less well-aligned with the surrounding matrix, which can lead to a decrease in the strength of the material.

However, reason [r] is not the correct reason for assertion [a]. The addition of strong carbide-forming elements to low alloy steels does not directly affect the coherency of the particles during creep deformation. Instead, these elements help to strengthen the steel and improve its creep resistance by forming carbides that act as obstacles to dislocation movement.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a].

The correct answer is (D) If $ΔH_(mix)$ < 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$.

Explanation:

For a dilute solution of B in A, the activity of B ($a_B$) is related to its mole fraction ($X_B$) and the mixing enthalpy ($ΔH_(mix)$) as follows:

$a_B = γ_B X_B$

where $γ_B$ is the activity coefficient of B.

In a dilute solution, the activity coefficient of B is related to the mixing enthalpy as follows:

$γ_B = exp(-ΔH_(mix)/RT)$

where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the temperature.

If $ΔH_(mix)$ < 0, then $γ_B$ < 1, which means that $a_B$ < $X_B$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) If $ΔH_(mix)$ < 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$.

The correct answer is (B).

Explanation:

The given reaction is:

M(s) + CO2(g) = MO(s) + CO(g)

To determine the number of degrees of freedom, we need to use the Gibbs phase rule. The Gibbs phase rule states that the number of degrees of freedom (F) is given by:

F = C - P + 2

where C is the number of components, P is the number of phases, and 2 is a constant.

In this case, we have 4 components (M, CO2, MO, and CO) and 2 phases (solid and gas). Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom is:

F = 4 - 2 + 2 = 4

However, we also need to consider the number of independent reactions. In this case, we have 1 independent reaction (the given reaction). Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced by 1:

F = 4 - 1 = 3

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).

The correct answer is: (D) $ΔH_(mix)^(solid)$ = 0 and $ΔH_(mix)^(liquid)$ << 0

Explanation:

The given binary phase diagram of A-B shows a eutectic point, which is a point where the liquid phase of the mixture solidifies into two solid phases. This type of phase diagram is typically observed when the enthalpy of mixing of the liquid phase is much less than zero ($ΔH_(mix)^(liquid)$ << 0), indicating a strong negative deviation from ideal behavior.

In contrast, the enthalpy of mixing of the solid phase is zero ($ΔH_(mix)^(solid)$ = 0), indicating that the solid phase behaves ideally. This means that the solid phase is a simple mixture of the two components A and B, without any significant interaction between them.

The weight gain (mg $cm^2$) after a duration of 1600s is?(round off to nearest integer). ,"

The given information is:

Weight gain is proportional to the square root of time.
Nickel undergoes isothermal oxidation at 800K for a duration of 400s, resulting in a weight gain of 2mg $cm^2$.

To find the weight gain after a duration of 1600s, we can use the proportionality relationship:

Weight gain ∝ √time

Let's denote the weight gain after 400s as $W_1$ and the weight gain after 1600s as $W_2$. We can set up a proportion:

$W_1$ / √400 = $W_2$ / √1600

Substituting the given values, we have:

2 / √400 = $W_2$ / √1600

Solving for $W_2$, we get:

$W_2$ = (2 / √400) × √1600

$W_2$ = 2 × √4

$W_2$ = 4 mg $cm^2$

Therefore, the weight gain after a duration of 1600s is 4mg $cm^2$.

Answer: 4mg $cm^2$

The correct answer is (C).

The emissive power of an ideal black body peaks at a wavelength λ which is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature. This is known as Wien's displacement law.

The other options are incorrect:

(A) Among all radiation emitted by an ideal black body at room temperature, the most intense radiation falls in the infrared spectrum, not the visible light spectrum.

(B) The total emissive power of an ideal black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature, not the square.

(D) The radiant energy emitted by an ideal black body is greater than that emitted by the non-black body at all temperatures above 0 K. This is because the emissivity of a non-black body is always less than 1, while the emissivity of a black body is 1.

The correct answer is A.

Explanation:

The critical value of the Gibbs energy of nucleation at equilibrium temperature is zero. This is because at equilibrium, the Gibbs energy of the system is at a minimum, and any change in the system will result in an increase in the Gibbs energy. Therefore, the critical value of the Gibbs energy of nucleation at equilibrium temperature is zero.

Thermodynamics,93,G-META-14-53,NUM,48,The specific heat ($C_p$) of pure iron expressed in J/(mol.K) as a function of temperature T (in K) is given as: $C_p$ = 17.49 + 24.77 * $10^(-3)*T$. What is the change in the enthalpy of pure iron (in J/mol) when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C?,"

The change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C can be calculated using the following equation:

$$\Delta H = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} C_p dT$$

where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the initial and final temperatures, respectively.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\Delta H = \int_{298}^{973} (17.49 + 24.77 \times 10^{-3}T) dT$$

$$\Delta H = 17.49(973 - 298) + 24.77 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{1}{2}(973^2 - 298^2)$$

$$\Delta H = 11847.75 + 11847.75$$

$$\Delta H = 23695.5 \text{ J/mol}$$

Therefore, the change in enthalpy of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C is 23695.5 J/mol.

The standard Gibbs free energy change for the change of standard state from pure liquid to 1 wt.% for Si dissolved in liquid Fe at 1873 K can be calculated using the following equation:

$$\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln \gamma_{Si}^\circ$$

where $\Delta G^\circ$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $\gamma_{Si}^\circ$ is the activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution in Fe.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\Delta G^\circ = -(8.314 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kJ/mol K}) \times (1873 \text{ K}) \times \ln(10^{-3})$$

The initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by radiation and convection can be calculated using the following equation:

Q = Q_rad + Q_conv

where Q_rad is the rate of heat loss by radiation and Q_conv is the rate of heat loss by convection.

Q_rad = εσA(T^4 - T_amb^4)

where ε is the emissivity of the steel, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area of the slab, T is the temperature of the slab, and T_amb is the ambient temperature.

Q_conv = hA(T - T_amb)

where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient and A is the surface area of the slab.

Substituting the given values into the equations, we get:

Q_rad = 0.8 * 5.7 * 10^(-8) * (1 * 1) * (1298^4 - 298^4) = 10.5 kW

Q_conv = 4.6 * (1 * 1) * (1298 - 298) = 4.6 kW

The given information is:

Gas constant R = 8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$

Reaction: 4Ag(s, pure) + $O_2$(g) ⟶ $2Ag_(2)O$(s, pure)

Standard enthalpy change, ∆𝐻° = − 61080 J

Standard entropy change, ∆𝑆° = − 132.22 J $K^(−1)$

Temperature range: 298 K to 500 K

Partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm

To determine the temperature above which $Ag_(2)O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm, we need to find the temperature at which the Gibbs free energy change (∆𝐺°) for the reaction becomes positive.

The Gibbs free energy change is given by:

∆𝐺° = ∆𝐻° − 𝑇∆𝑆°

where 𝑇 is the temperature in Kelvin.

We can rearrange the equation to solve for 𝑇:

𝑇 = (∆𝐻° − ∆𝐺°) / ∆𝑆°

Substituting the given values, we get:

𝑇 = (−61080 J − ∆𝐺°) / (−132.22 J $K^(−1)$)

To find the temperature at which ∆𝐺° becomes positive, we set ∆𝐺° = 0:

𝑇 = (−61080 J − 0) / (−132.22 J $K^(−1)$)

𝑇 ≈ 462 K

Therefore, the temperature above which $Ag_(2)O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm is approximately 462 K.

The critical radius (in nm, rounded off to one decimal place) of nickel nucleus during solidification at 1673 K is ","

The critical radius of a nucleus during solidification can be calculated using the following equation:

r* = 2γ/ΔG_v

where γ is the liquid-solid interfacial energy, and ΔG_v is the change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume.

To calculate ΔG_v, we can use the following equation:

ΔG_v = ΔH_f * ΔT / T_m

where ΔH_f is the enthalpy of fusion, ΔT is the undercooling (T_m - T), and T_m is the equilibrium melting temperature.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

ΔG_v = (2.65 × $10^9$ 𝐽.$𝑚^(−3)$) * (1728 K - 1673 K) / 1728 K

ΔG_v = 1.13 × $10^8$ 𝐽.$𝑚^(−3)$

Now, we can calculate the critical radius:

r* = 2 * (0.5 𝐽. $𝑚^(−2)$) / (1.13 × $10^8$ 𝐽.$𝑚^(−3)$)

r* = 9.09 × $10^(−10)$ 𝑚

Converting to nanometers, we get:

r* = 0.91 nm

Therefore, the critical radius of nickel nucleus during solidification at 1673 K is 0.9 nm.

What is the equilibrium ($p_(CO)$/$p_(CO_2)$) ratio for the given reaction at 1873 K? (round off to 2 decimal places). Mo(s) + $O_2$(g) ⇔ $MoO_2$(s),"
The given information is:

$Δ_(f)G°_(1873)$ = -262300 J
$a_(MoO_(2))$ (s) = 0.5
$Δ_(r)G°_(1873)$ = -120860 J
R = 8.314 J.$K^(-1).mol^(-1)$

The equilibrium reaction is:

CO(g) + 0.5$O_2$(g) ⇔ $CO_2$(g)

To find the equilibrium ($p_(CO)$/$p_(CO_2)$) ratio, we can use the following equation:

$K_(eq) = (p_(CO_2))/(p_(CO) * (p_(O_2))^(0.5))$

where $K_(eq)$ is the equilibrium constant, $p_(CO_2)$ is the partial pressure of $CO_2$, $p_(CO)$ is the partial pressure of CO, and $p_(O_2)$ is the partial pressure of $O_2$.

To find $K_(eq)$, we can use the following equation:

$Δ_(r)G° = -RT ln K_(eq)$

where $Δ_(r)G°$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$-120860 J = -(8.314 J.$K^(-1).mol^(-1)) * (1873 K) * ln K_(eq)$

Solving for $K_(eq)$, we get:

$K_(eq) = 1.00$

Now, we can use the equation for the equilibrium ($p_(CO)$/$p_(CO_2)$) ratio to find the value:

$1.00 = (p_(CO_2))/(p_(CO) * (p_(O_2))^(0.5))$

Rearranging the equation, we get:

$p_(CO) * (p_(O_2))^(0.5) = p_(CO_2)$

Dividing both sides by $p_(CO_2)$, we get:

$p_(CO) * (p_(O_2))^(0.5) / p_(CO_2) = 1$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$p_(CO) / p_(CO_2) = 1 / (p_(O_2))^(0.5)$

Therefore, the equilibrium ($p_(CO)$/$p_(CO_2)$) ratio is $1 / (p_(O_2))^(0.5)$.

Assuming regular solution behavior, the activity of Au in the melt is:

To calculate the activity of Au in the melt, we can use the following equation:

where:

$a_{Au}$ is the activity of Au in the melt

$\Delta H_{Au}$ is the partial molar enthalpy of Au in the melt

The Dulong-Petit law states that the molar heat capacity of a monoatomic solid is approximately 3R, where R is the gas constant. Therefore, the molar heat capacity of the given solid at 500K is approximately 3R = 3 * 8.314 J/K/mol = 24.942 J/K/mol.

The correct answer is: C) Cation and anion vacancy

Explanation:

A Schottky defect in an ionic crystal is a stochiometric defect that involves the absence of both a cation and an anion from their respective lattice sites. This creates a pair of vacancies, one for the cation and one for the anion. The overall charge of the crystal remains neutral, as the number of cations and anions is still equal.

The other options are incorrect:

A) Cation vacancy: A cation vacancy is a type of point defect where a cation is missing from its lattice site. This creates a net positive charge in the crystal.

B) Anion vacancy: An anion vacancy is a type of point defect where an anion is missing from its lattice site. This creates a net negative charge in the crystal.

D) Cation and anion interstitial: A cation and anion interstitial is a type of point defect where an ion is located in an interstitial site, which is a space between the lattice sites. This creates a net charge in the crystal, depending on the type of ion that is located in the interstitial site.

Therefore, the correct answer is: C) Cation and anion vacancy.

The correct answer is (B) 33.05°.

Explanation:

To find the first diffraction peak position (2θ) for Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 1.54 Å for chromium with the bcc structure and atomic diameter of 2.494 Å, we can use Bragg's law:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where:

n is the order of the diffraction peak (we want the first peak, so n = 1)
λ is the wavelength of the radiation (1.54 Å)
d is the interplanar spacing (we need to calculate this for the bcc structure)
θ is the diffraction angle (we want to find 2θ)

For the bcc structure, the interplanar spacing for the (100) planes is given by:

d = a / 2

where a is the lattice parameter.

For a bcc structure, the lattice parameter is related to the atomic diameter (D) by:

a = D√3

Substituting the given values, we get:

a = 2.494 Å / √3 = 1.442 Å

d = 1.442 Å / 2 = 0.721 Å

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the diffraction angle:

1.54 Å = 2(0.721 Å) sin(θ)

sin(θ) = 1.54 Å / (2(0.721 Å)) = 1.07

θ = sin-1(1.07) = 85.5°

The first diffraction peak position (2θ) is:

2θ = 2(85.5°) = 171°

However, since the diffraction angle is usually measured in degrees, we need to convert this to degrees:

2θ = 171° = 33.05°

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 33.05°.

The planar density of the (100) plane in an fcc crystal is the number of atoms per unit area in the plane. To calculate this, we need to know the atomic radius of the element, R, and the lattice constant of the fcc crystal, a.

The lattice constant of an fcc crystal is related to the atomic radius by the equation:

a = 2R√2

The area of the (100) plane in an fcc crystal is given by:

A = a^2

The number of atoms in the (100) plane is given by:

N = 4

Therefore, the planar density of the (100) plane in an fcc crystal is:

ρ = N/A = 4/(a^2) = 4/(2R√2)^2 = 1/(2R^2)

So, the correct answer is (B) 0.25/$R^2$.

The correct answer is (B) One Zn vacancy and one Zn interstitial in ZnO.

Explanation:

A Frenkel defect is a type of point defect in a crystal lattice where an atom or ion is displaced from its normal lattice position to an interstitial site, leaving behind a vacancy. In the case of ZnO, a Frenkel defect would involve a Zn atom or ion being displaced from its normal lattice position to an interstitial site, leaving behind a vacancy. This would result in one Zn vacancy and one Zn interstitial in the crystal lattice.

Option (A) is incorrect because it involves two different types of ions (Cl and Na) and does not involve a displacement of an atom or ion to an interstitial site.

Option (C) is incorrect because it involves a substitutional defect, where a K atom replaces a Na atom in the lattice, rather than a Frenkel defect.

Option (D) is incorrect because it is a general statement and does not provide a specific example of a Frenkel defect.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) One Zn vacancy and one Zn interstitial in ZnO.

The correct answer is (B) (i) and (iii).

Explanation:

(i) Polymers that are less coiled are more crystalline than those that are more coiled:

This statement is true. Polymers that are less coiled have a more ordered structure, which allows for more efficient packing and higher crystallinity.

(ii) Branched polymers are more crystalline than the linear ones:

This statement is false. Branched polymers have a more disordered structure, which makes it more difficult for them to pack efficiently and form crystals.

(iii) Polymers with inter-chain interactions have higher glass transition temperature than those without inter-chain interactions:

This statement is true. Inter-chain interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions, increase the strength of the polymer and make it more resistant to deformation. This results in a higher glass transition temperature.

(iv) Polymers with inter-chain interactions are more crystalline than those without inter-chain interactions:

This statement is false. Inter-chain interactions can actually hinder the formation of crystals, as they can interfere with the packing of the polymer chains.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) (i) and (iii).

Explanation:

A triatomic molecule has 3N degrees of freedom, where N is the number of atoms. In this case, N = 3. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom is 3 x 3 = 9.

Out of these 9 degrees of freedom, 3 are translational (motion in the x, y, and z directions), and 3 are rotational (rotation around the x, y, and z axes). This leaves 3 degrees of freedom for vibrational motion.

Therefore, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for a non-linear triatomic molecule is 3.

The correct answer is (D) the formation of a Na+1 and Cl‾ vacancy pair.

Explanation:

When a Na+1 ion is substituted by a Ca2+ ion in NaCl, the charge balance is disturbed. To maintain charge neutrality, a Cl‾ vacancy is created. Additionally, to maintain the stoichiometry of the crystal, a Na+1 vacancy is also created.

Therefore, the substitution of a Na+1 ion by a Ca2+ ion in NaCl would most probably lead to the formation of a Na+1 and Cl‾ vacancy pair.

If one of the repeat units is ethylene, the other one is  (A) $−CH_2−CH(CH_3)−$ (B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$ (C) $−CF_2−CF_2−$ (D) $−CH_2−CH(C_6H_5)−$","

The given information is:

Atomic weight of H = 1
Atomic weight of C = 12
Atomic weight of F = 19
Atomic weight of Cl = 35.5
Number-averaged molecular weight of the copolymer = $10^5$ g/mol
Degree of polymerization of the copolymer = 2210

To determine the other repeat unit, we need to calculate the molecular weight of the ethylene repeat unit and compare it with the molecular weight of the copolymer.

Molecular weight of ethylene repeat unit = 2 x atomic weight of C + 4 x atomic weight of H = 2 x 12 + 4 x 1 = 28 g/mol

Molecular weight of the copolymer = number-averaged molecular weight x degree of polymerization = $10^5$ g/mol x 2210 = $2.21 x 10^8$ g/mol

Now, we can calculate the molecular weight of the other repeat unit by subtracting the molecular weight of the ethylene repeat unit from the molecular weight of the copolymer.

Molecular weight of the other repeat unit = molecular weight of the copolymer - molecular weight of the ethylene repeat unit = $2.21 x 10^8$ g/mol - 28 g/mol = $2.21 x 10^8$ g/mol

To determine the other repeat unit, we need to consider the options given in the question.

Option A: $−CH_2−CH(CH_3)−$

Molecular weight of this repeat unit = 2 x atomic weight of C + 6 x atomic weight of H + atomic weight of C = 2 x 12 + 6 x 1 + 12 = 36 g/mol

This is not the correct option as the molecular weight of this repeat unit is not equal to the molecular weight of the other repeat unit.

Option B: $−CH_2−CHCl−$

Molecular weight of this repeat unit = 2 x atomic weight of C + 4 x atomic weight of H + atomic weight of Cl = 2 x 12 + 4 x 1 + 35.5 = 63.5 g/mol

This is not the correct option as the molecular weight of this repeat unit is not equal to the molecular weight of the other repeat unit.

Option C: $−CF_2−CF_2−$

Molecular weight of this repeat unit = 2 x atomic weight of C + 4 x atomic weight of F = 2 x 12 + 4 x 19 = 100 g/mol

This is not the correct option as the molecular weight of this repeat unit is not equal to the molecular weight of the other repeat unit.

Option D: $−CH_2−CH(C_6H_5)−$

Molecular weight of this repeat unit = 2 x atomic weight of C + 4 x atomic weight of H + atomic weight of C + 6 x atomic weight of H + 5 x atomic weight of C = 2 x 12 + 4 x 1 + 12 + 6 x 1 + 5 x 12 = 104 g/mol

This is the correct option as the molecular weight of this repeat unit is equal to the molecular weight of the other repeat unit.

Therefore, the other repeat unit is $−CH_2−CH(C_6H_5)−$.

The correct answer is (A) $E^(1/2)$.

Explanation:

The density of states, D(E), in a three-dimensional solid varies with energy(E) as $E^(1/2)$. This is because the number of states available for electrons to occupy increases with energy, and the density of states is proportional to the number of states available.

In a three-dimensional solid, the energy of an electron is given by the equation:

E = (h^2/2m)(k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2)

where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and k_x, k_y, and k_z are the components of the electron's wave vector.

The number of states available for electrons to occupy is proportional to the volume of k-space that is available. In a three-dimensional solid, the volume of k-space is proportional to $E^(3/2)$. Therefore, the density of states is proportional to $E^(1/2)$.

Here is a list of the correct answer:

Answer: (A) (111) [110]

Explanation:

In face-centered cubic (FCC) metals, the most favored slip system is (111) [110]. This means that the slip plane is the (111) plane, and the slip direction is the [110] direction.

The slip plane is the plane along which the dislocations move, and the slip direction is the direction in which the dislocations move. The slip system is the combination of the slip plane and the slip direction.

In FCC metals, the (111) plane is the most densely packed plane, and the [110] direction is the most densely packed direction. Therefore, the (111) [110] slip system is the most favored slip system in FCC metals.

Here are some additional details about the (111) [110] slip system in FCC metals:

Atomic structure,27,G-XEC-2021-13,MCQS,30,X-ray diffraction peak broadening enables the estimation of  (A) crystallite size of the material (B) microstrain in the material (C) precise lattice parameter (D) residual macrostress acting on the material,"

The correct answer is: (A) crystallite size of the material

Explanation:

X-ray diffraction peak broadening is a phenomenon that occurs when the diffraction peaks in an X-ray diffraction pattern are broader than expected. This broadening can be caused by a variety of factors, including the size of the crystallites in the material, the presence of microstrain, and the presence of residual macrostress.

The size of the crystallites in the material is one of the most common causes of X-ray diffraction peak broadening. When the crystallites are small, the diffraction peaks are broader than expected because the X-rays are scattered by a larger number of crystallites, which leads to a greater degree of interference. This effect is known as the Scherrer effect, and it can be used to estimate the size of the crystallites in the material.

Microstrain is another factor that can cause X-ray diffraction peak broadening. Microstrain is a type of strain that occurs on a very small scale, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, including the presence of defects in the material, the presence of impurities, and the presence of residual stress. When microstrain is present, the diffraction peaks are broader than expected because the X-rays are scattered by a larger number of crystallites, which leads to a greater degree of interference.

Residual macrostress is a type of stress that is present in the material after it has been processed or fabricated. This type of stress can be caused by a variety of factors, including the presence of defects in the material, the presence of impurities, and the presence of residual stress. When residual macrostress is present, the diffraction peaks are broader than expected because the X-rays are scattered by a larger number of crystallites, which leads to a greater degree of interference.

In summary, X-ray diffraction peak broadening can be caused by a variety of factors, including the size of the crystallites in the material, the presence of microstrain, and the presence of residual macrostress. The size of the crystallites in the material is one of the most common causes of X-ray diffraction peak broadening, and it can be used to estimate the size of the crystallites in the material.

The given information is:

- X-rays of unknown wavelength are diffracted by an FCC metal with a lattice parameter of 0.352nm.
- The measured '2θ' angle for the {200} peak is 61.08°.

To calculate the wavelength of the X-ray used, we can use the Bragg's law, which relates the wavelength of the X-ray to the lattice spacing and the diffraction angle.

Bragg's law: nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where:

- n is the order of diffraction (usually 1 for first-order diffraction)
- λ is the wavelength of the X-ray
- d is the lattice spacing
- θ is the diffraction angle

For the {200} peak in an FCC metal, the lattice spacing is given by:

d = a / √2

where a is the lattice parameter.

Substituting the given values into the Bragg's law equation:

1 * λ = 2 * (0.352nm / √2) * sin(61.08° / 2)

Atomic structure,37,G-XEC-2018-20,NUM,35,X -ray diffraction pattern is obtained from FCC polycrystalline aluminium (lattice parameter = 0.405 nm) using Cr-Kα radiation of wavelength 0.229 nm. The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the pattern is ,"

The correct answer is 10.

Explanation:

The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern of FCC polycrystalline aluminium using Cr-Kα radiation of wavelength 0.229 nm is 10.

This can be calculated using the Bragg's law, which states that the diffraction angle θ is related to the wavelength λ and the interplanar spacing d as follows:

nλ = 2d sin θ

where n is an integer representing the order of the diffraction peak.

For FCC polycrystalline aluminium, the interplanar spacing d can be calculated using the lattice parameter a as follows:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where (hkl) are the Miller indices of the crystal plane.

For the first-order diffraction peak (n=1), the interplanar spacing d is 0.405 nm, and the corresponding diffraction angle θ is 22.9°.

For the second-order diffraction peak (n=2), the interplanar spacing d is 0.2025 nm, and the corresponding diffraction angle θ is 45.8°.

Similarly, for the third-order diffraction peak (n=3), the interplanar spacing d is 0.135 nm, and the corresponding diffraction angle θ is 68.7°.

The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern is 10, which corresponds to the tenth-order diffraction peak (n=10) with an interplanar spacing d of 0.0405 nm and a diffraction angle θ of 157.4°.

The correct answer is (B) 76.99°.

Explanation:

For an FCC structure, the interplanar spacing (d) for the (hkl) planes is given by:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

For the fourth reflection, h = k = l = 4.

Therefore, d = 3.5 / √(4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2) = 0.875 Å

Using Bragg's law, 2d sin(θ) = nλ, where n is the order of reflection (in this case, n = 4), we can calculate the Bragg angle (2θ):

2θ = 2 sin^-1(nλ / 2d)

Substituting the values, we get:

2θ = 2 sin^-1(4 * 1.54056 / 2 * 0.875)

The ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface for a FCC metal is 0.87.

Explanation:

The surface energy of a crystal surface is proportional to the number of broken bonds per unit area. For a FCC metal, the {111} surface has 3 broken bonds per unit area, while the {100} surface has 4 broken bonds per unit area. Therefore, the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface is 3/4 = 0.75.

However, this is only an approximation, as it assumes that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy.

Atomic weight of C: 12.0
Avogadro's number: 6.023 × 10^23
Lattice parameter of Fe-10 atom % C austenite (fcc): 4 Å

To calculate the density of austenite, we need to determine the mass of the unit cell and the volume of the unit cell.

The unit cell of fcc (face-centered cubic) structure contains 4 atoms. In this case, we have Fe-10 atom % C austenite, which means that 10% of the atoms are carbon and 90% are iron.

Mass of the unit cell:

The mass of the unit cell is the sum of the masses of the individual atoms in the unit cell.

Mass of Fe atoms: 4 × 0.9 × 55.8 = 199.8 g
Mass of C atoms: 4 × 0.1 × 12.0 = 4.8 g
Total mass of the unit cell: 199.8 + 4.8 = 204.6 g

Volume of the unit cell:

The volume of the unit cell is the cube of the lattice parameter.

Volume of the unit cell: (4 Å)^3 = 64 Å^3

Density of austenite:

Density is the mass per unit volume.

Density of austenite: 204.6 g / (64 Å^3) = 3.197 g/Å^3

Density in g/cm^3: 3.197 g/Å^3 × (10^-10 m/Å)^3 × (10^2 m/cm)^3 = 3.197 g/cm^3

The correct answer is (B) d/n.

Explanation:

The inter-planar spacing of the planes {h k l} is given by the formula:

d = 1 / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)^(1/2)

For the planes {nh nk nl}, the inter-planar spacing is given by:

d' = 1 / (n^2 h^2 + n^2 k^2 + n^2 l^2)^(1/2)

Simplifying, we get:

d' = 1 / (n (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)^(1/2))

d' = 1 / n * 1 / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)^(1/2)

d' = 1 / n * d

d' = d / n

Therefore, the inter-planar spacing of the planes {nh nk nl} is d / n.

The correct answer is (A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1].

Explanation:

A unit dislocation splits into two partial dislocations when the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation is not a lattice vector. In this case, the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation is (a/2)[1 -1 0], which is not a lattice vector. Therefore, it splits into two partial dislocations with Burgers vectors (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1].

The sum of the Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations must be equal to the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation. In this case, (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] = (a/2)[1 -1 0].

Therefore, the correct combination of the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations for a given unit dislocation having Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0] is (A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1].

The correct answer is (B) 0.74.

Explanation:

The packing density of a crystal structure is the fraction of the total volume occupied by the atoms. The packing density of a (100) plane in a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure is 0.74.

The [110] direction is a diagonal direction in the FCC crystal structure, and it has the maximum linear density. This means that the [110] direction has the highest number of atoms per unit length.

The correct answer is (C) 1.41.

Explanation:

For an FCC metal, the first two peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern correspond to the (111) and (200) planes. The interplanar spacing for the (111) plane is given by:

d111 = a / sqrt(3)

where a is the lattice parameter.

The interplanar spacing for the (200) plane is given by:

d200 = a / 2

The ratio of the interplanar spacing for the first two peaks is:

d111 / d200 = (a / sqrt(3)) / (a / 2) = 2 / sqrt(3) = 1.15

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1.41.

The correct answer is (C) 2.2 * $10^(-9)$.

The energy of an edge dislocation can be calculated using the following formula:

E = Gb^2 / 4π(1-v)

where G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector, and v is Poisson's ratio.

For α-Fe, G = 70 GPa, b = 0.25 nm, and v = 0.3.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

E = (70 * $10^9$ N/m^2) * (0.25 * $10^(-9)$ m)^2 / 4π(1-0.3)

E = 2.2 * $10^(-9)$ J/m

The atomic radius of aluminium is 1.431 Å. The interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium, in Å, is?

Answer:

The interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium can be calculated using the following formula:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where d is the interplanar spacing, a is the lattice constant, and h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the plane.

For aluminium, the lattice constant is 4.049 Å. Therefore, the interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium is:

d = 4.049 Å / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)

d = 4.049 Å / √(3)

d = 2.34 Å

Therefore, the interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium is 2.34 Å.

The correct answer is (B) Tetragonal.

Explanation:

In a conventional unit cell of a crystal, the relationship between the lattice parameters (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) and the angles (𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾) determines the crystal system to which it belongs.

In this case, we have 𝑎 = 𝑏 ≠ 𝑐 and 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 𝛾 = 90°. This means that two of the lattice parameters are equal (𝑎 and 𝑏), and the third one (𝑐) is different. Additionally, all the angles are 90°, indicating that the unit cell is orthogonal.

Based on these conditions, the crystal system that matches this description is the Tetragonal system.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Tetragonal.

The radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void of a FCC metal with a lattice parameter of 0.401 nm can be calculated as follows:

The tetrahedral void in a FCC metal is surrounded by four atoms, and the distance between the center of the void and the center of each atom is equal to the radius of the atom. Therefore, the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void is half the distance between the center of the void and the center of each atom.

The distance between the center of the void and the center of each atom can be calculated using the lattice parameter and the geometry of the FCC unit cell. In a FCC unit cell, the distance between the center of the void and the center of each atom is equal to the distance between the center of the unit cell and the center of each atom, which is equal to the lattice parameter divided by 2.

Therefore, the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void is equal to the lattice parameter divided by 4.

In this case, the lattice parameter is 0.401 nm, so the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void is 0.401 nm / 4 = 0.10025 nm.

The correct answer is 0.154.

The lattice parameter of the FCC crystal is 0.3615 nm.

The Bragg angle (θ) for the reflection from (111) planes is 21.68°.

The wavelength of X-rays (λ) can be calculated using the Bragg equation:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where n is the order of reflection (usually 1), d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the Bragg angle.

For the (111) planes in an FCC crystal, the interplanar spacing (d) is given by:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter, and h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the plane.

For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1.

Therefore, d = 0.3615 nm / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = 0.2080 nm.

Substituting the values into the Bragg equation:

1 * λ = 2 * 0.2080 nm * sin(21.68°)

λ = 0.154 nm

Therefore, the wavelength of X-rays is 0.154 nm.

The correct answer is: (C) (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] → (1/2)[1 1 0]

Explanation:

The given dislocation reactions are:

(A) (1/2)[0 -1 1] → (1/6)[1 -2 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]
(B) (1/2)[1 -1 0] + (1/2)[1 -1 0] → [1 -1 0]
(C) (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] → (1/2)[1 1 0]
(D) (1/2)[-1 0 1] → (1/6)[-2 1 1 ] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]

In a FCC crystal, dislocation reactions are governed by the Frank-Read mechanism, which involves the movement of dislocations along slip planes. The slip planes in a FCC crystal are the {111} planes, and the slip directions are the <110> directions.

To determine whether a dislocation reaction is feasible, we need to check if the Burgers vectors of the dislocations involved in the reaction are compatible with the slip planes and slip directions of the FCC crystal.

Let's analyze each reaction:

(A) (1/2)[0 -1 1] → (1/6)[1 -2 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]

The Burgers vector of the dislocation on the left-hand side is (1/2)[0 -1 1], which is not a <110> direction. Therefore, this reaction is not feasible in a FCC crystal.

(B) (1/2)[1 -1 0] + (1/2)[1 -1 0] → [1 -1 0]

The Burgers vectors of the dislocations on the left-hand side are (1/2)[1 -1 0] and (1/2)[1 -1 0], which are both <110> directions. The Burgers vector of the dislocation on the right-hand side is [1 -1 0], which is also a <110> direction. Therefore, this reaction is feasible in a FCC crystal.

(C) (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] → (1/2)[1 1 0]

The Burgers vector of the dislocation on the left-hand side is (1/6)[1 1 -2], which is not a <110> direction. Therefore, this reaction is not feasible in a FCC crystal.

(D) (1/2)[-1 0 1] → (1/6)[-2 1 1 ] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]

The Burgers vector of the dislocation on the left-hand side is (1/2)[-1 0 1], which is a <110> direction. The Burgers vectors of the dislocations on the right-hand side are (1/6)[-2 1 1 ] and (1/6)[-1 -1 2], which are also <110> directions. Therefore, this reaction is feasible in a FCC crystal.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: (C) (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] → (1/2)[1 1 0]

This reaction is not feasible in a FCC crystal because the Burgers vector of the dislocation on the left-hand side is not a <110> direction.

(A) Both [a] and [r] are true and [r] is the correct reason for [a] (B) Both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a] (C) Both [a] and [r] are false (D) [a] is true but [r] is false,"

The assertion is true. The rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution of B in A is controlled by the diffusivity of B. This is because the rate of diffusion of B atoms in the A lattice is the rate-limiting step in the homogenization process.

The reason is false. Atomic migration can occur along dislocations and grain boundaries. In fact, these defects can act as fast diffusion paths, allowing atoms to move more quickly than they would in a perfect crystal lattice.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).

The grain size (X) of annealed specimens follows a symmetric distribution with a mean (µ) of 5µm and a standard deviation (σ) of 0.5 µm. The percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is expected to be:

P(5 ≤ X ≤ 6) = P(X ≤ 6) - P(X ≤ 5)

P(X ≤ 5) = P(X ≤ µ) = 0.5

Atomic structure,88,G-META-14-31,MCQS,54,Dissociation of a dislocation into two partials in an FCC metal is given by the following equation. (a/2)[1 -1 0] → (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] . On which plane do these two partial dislocaitons lie?  (A) (-1 1 1) (B) (1 1 1) (C) (1 -1 1) (D) (1 1 -1),"

The correct answer is (B) (1 1 1).

Explanation:

The given equation represents the dissociation of a dislocation into two partial dislocations in an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) metal. The equation is as follows:

(a/2)[1 -1 0] → (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1]

In this equation, (a/2)[1 -1 0] represents the Burgers vector of the original dislocation, and (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1] represent the Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations.

To determine the plane on which these two partial dislocations lie, we need to consider the slip planes in an FCC crystal. In an FCC crystal, the slip planes are the {1 1 1} planes, which include the (1 1 1), (-1 1 1), (1 -1 1), and (1 1 -1) planes.

The Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations, (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1], are both parallel to the (1 1 1) plane. Therefore, the two partial dislocations lie on the (1 1 1) plane.

So, the correct answer is (B) (1 1 1).

The correct answer is (A).

Explanation:

Refractory BCC metals like W and Mo are less ductile than FCC metals like Ni and Pt at room temperature because BCC metals have fewer independent slip systems than FCC metals.

The number of independent slip systems in a crystal structure determines the ductility of the material. FCC metals have more independent slip systems than BCC metals, which allows them to deform more easily and exhibit greater ductility.

Therefore, the assertion is true and the reason is the correct explanation for the assertion.

The number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure can be calculated using the following formula:

Number of atoms per unit area = 2 / (a^2)

where a is the lattice constant of the FCC crystal structure.

To calculate the lattice constant, we can use the formula:

a = 2 * r * sqrt(2)

where r is the atomic radius of the element.

Substituting the given values, we get:

a = 2 * 0.175 nm * sqrt(2) = 0.485 nm

Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb is:

Number of atoms per unit area = 2 / (0.485 nm)^2 = 8.41 atoms/nm^2

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

Number of atoms per unit area = 8 atoms/nm^2

So, the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb is 8 atoms/nm^2.

(A) 0.185 (B) 0.262 (C) 0.320 (D) 0.370","

The correct answer is (B) 0.262.

Explanation:

The lattice parameter of a crystal structure can be calculated using the Bragg's law, which relates the wavelength of the X-ray used, the Bragg angle, and the lattice spacing.

The Bragg's law is given by:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where:

n is the order of the reflection (usually 1)
λ is the wavelength of the X-ray used
d is the lattice spacing
θ is the Bragg angle

For the given problem, we have:

λ = 0.1543 nm
θ = 24.65°
n = 1

Substituting these values into the Bragg's law, we get:

0.1543 nm = 2d sin(24.65°)

Solving for d, we get:

d = 0.1543 nm / (2 sin(24.65°))

d = 0.262 nm

Therefore, the lattice parameter of the metal with a FCC crystal structure is 0.262 nm.

The given information is:

- R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$
- The vacancy concentration in a crystal doubles upon increasing the temperature from 27°C to 127°C.

To find the enthalpy of vacancy formation, we can use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the concentration of vacancies to the temperature and the enthalpy of vacancy formation.

The Boltzmann distribution is given by:

$n = N \exp(-E_f/kT)$

where:

- $n$ is the number of vacancies
- $N$ is the total number of lattice sites
- $E_f$ is the enthalpy of vacancy formation
- $k$ is the Boltzmann constant
- $T$ is the temperature

We can rearrange this equation to solve for $E_f$:

$E_f = -kT \ln(n/N)$

We are given that the vacancy concentration doubles upon increasing the temperature from 27°C to 127°C. This means that the ratio of the number of vacancies at the higher temperature to the number of vacancies at the lower temperature is 2.

Let's call the number of vacancies at the lower temperature $n_1$ and the number of vacancies at the higher temperature $n_2$. We can then write:

$n_2/n_1 = 2$

We can substitute this into the equation for $E_f$:

$E_f = -kT \ln(n_2/N) - (-kT \ln(n_1/N))$

$E_f = -kT \ln(2n_1/N) + kT \ln(n_1/N)$

$E_f = kT \ln(2)$

We can now substitute in the values for $k$ and $T$:

$E_f = (8.314 J/mol K) (127°C + 273.15 K) \ln(2)$

$E_f = 10.5 kJ/mol$

So the enthalpy of vacancy formation is 10.5 kJ/mol.

The correct answer is (B) 14.93 $cm^2$.

Explanation:

The elastic strain in the steel bar is given by:

$$\epsilon_{steel} = \frac{\sigma_{steel}}{E_{steel}} = \frac{20 \times 10^3}{200 \times 10^9 \times 8 \times 10^{-4}} = 1.25 \times 10^{-3}$$

The elastic strain in the aluminium bar is given by:

$$\epsilon_{Al} = \frac{\sigma_{Al}}{E_{Al}} = \frac{20 \times 10^3}{70 \times 10^9 \times A_{Al}} = \frac{2.86 \times 10^{-4}}{A_{Al}}$$

Since the elastic strain in the aluminium bar is the same as the steel bar, we can equate the two strains:

$$\epsilon_{Al} = \epsilon_{steel}$$

$$\frac{2.86 \times 10^{-4}}{A_{Al}} = 1.25 \times 10^{-3}$$

Solving for $A_{Al}$, we get:

$$A_{Al} = \frac{2.86 \times 10^{-4}}{1.25 \times 10^{-3}} = 0.2286 \times 10^{-1} m^2$$

Converting to $cm^2$, we get:

$$A_{Al} = 0.2286 \times 10^{-1} m^2 \times \frac{10^4 cm^2}{1 m^2} = 22.86 cm^2$$

Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the aluminium bar is 22.86 $cm^2$.

The Young’s modulus of a unidirectional SiC fiber reinforced Ti matrix composite is 185 GPa. If the Young’s moduli of Ti and SiC are 110 and 360 GPa respectively, the volume fraction of fibers in the composite is

Answer:

The volume fraction of fibers in the composite can be calculated using the rule of mixtures for Young's modulus. The rule of mixtures states that the Young's modulus of a composite is a weighted average of the Young's moduli of its constituents, with the weighting factors being the volume fractions of the constituents.

Let V_f be the volume fraction of fibers in the composite, and V_m be the volume fraction of the matrix. Then, the rule of mixtures for Young's modulus can be written as:

E_c = E_f * V_f + E_m * V_m

where E_c is the Young's modulus of the composite, E_f is the Young's modulus of the fibers, and E_m is the Young's modulus of the matrix.

Since the volume fractions must add up to 1, we have:

V_f + V_m = 1

Substituting this into the rule of mixtures equation, we get:

E_c = E_f * V_f + E_m * (1 - V_f)

Rearranging this equation to solve for V_f, we get:

V_f = (E_c - E_m) / (E_f - E_m)

Substituting the given values, we get:

V_f = (185 - 110) / (360 - 110)

V_f = 0.25

Therefore, the volume fraction of fibers in the composite is 0.25, or 25%.

The modulus of elasticity for this composite in the direction of fibre alignment in GPa is 51.9 GPa.

Explanation:

The relaxation time constant for this material is 27.7 days.

Explanation:

The relaxation time constant is the time it takes for the stress to decrease to 1/e (approximately 36.8%) of its initial value. In this case, the stress decreases from 10 MPa to 5 MPa, which is 50% of its initial value. Therefore, the relaxation time constant is:

It is noticed that the alloy does not exhibit any strain hardening and fails at a total strain of 0.108. The mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material in MJ/$m^3$ is,"

The answer is 49.29 MJ/$m^3$.

Explanation:

The mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material in MJ/$m^3$ is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the strain energy density:

strain energy density = 0.5 * Young's modulus * (strain)^2

strain energy density = 0.5 * 110 GPa * (0.108)^2

strain energy density = 0.63504 GPa

2. Convert the strain energy density to MJ/$m^3$:

strain energy density in MJ/$m^3$ = strain energy density in GPa * 10^6

strain energy density in MJ/$m^3$ = 0.63504 GPa * 10^6

strain energy density in MJ/$m^3$ = 635.04 MJ/$m^3$

3. Calculate the mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material:

mechanical energy = strain energy density * volume

mechanical energy = 635.04 MJ/$m^3$ * 1 $m^3$

mechanical energy = 635.04 MJ

4. Convert the mechanical energy to MJ:

mechanical energy in MJ = mechanical energy in J / 10^6

mechanical energy in MJ = 635.04 MJ / 10^6

mechanical energy in MJ = 0.63504 MJ

5. Round the answer to two decimal places:

mechanical energy in MJ = 0.64 MJ

Therefore, the mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material in MJ/$m^3$ is 0.64 MJ/$m^3$.

The stress required to change the polarization from 640 to 645 C m $m^(-3)$ in a piezoelectric material with a Young's modulus of 72 GPa can be calculated using the following formula:

$$\Delta P = \frac{d_{33} \Delta \sigma}{E}$$

where:

- $\Delta P$ is the change in polarization (in C m $m^(-3)$)
- $d_{33}$ is the piezoelectric strain coefficient (in m V $m^(-1)$)
- $\Delta \sigma$ is the change in stress (in MPa)
- $E$ is the Young's modulus (in GPa)

To solve for $\Delta \sigma$, we can rearrange the formula as follows:

$$\Delta \sigma = \frac{\Delta P E}{d_{33}}$$

Substituting the given values, we have:

$$\Delta \sigma = \frac{(645 - 640) \times 72}{d_{33}}$$

To find the value of $d_{33}$, we can use the following relationship:

$$d_{33} = \frac{Q_{33}}{E}$$

where $Q_{33}$ is the piezoelectric charge coefficient (in C m $m^(-2)$).

Assuming a typical value of $Q_{33}$ for a piezoelectric material, we can calculate $d_{33}$ as:

$$d_{33} = \frac{Q_{33}}{E} = \frac{10^{-12}}{72 \times 10^9} = 1.39 \times 10^{-21} \text{ m V $m^(-1)$}$$

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation for $\Delta \sigma$:

$$\Delta \sigma = \frac{(645 - 640) \times 72}{1.39 \times 10^{-21}} = 3.24 \times 10^{23} \text{ MPa}$$

Therefore, the stress required to change the polarization from 640 to 645 C m $m^(-3)$ in a piezoelectric material with a Young's modulus of 72 GPa is approximately $3.24 \times 10^{23}$ MPa.

The correct answer is: (D) 1/$E_C$ = [f/$E_m$] + (1-f)/$E_f$

Explanation:

The iso-stress condition implies that the stress in the matrix and fibers is the same. Therefore, the strain in the matrix and fibers will be different. The total strain in the composite will be the sum of the strains in the matrix and fibers, weighted by their respective volume fractions.

Using the iso-stress condition and the definition of Young's modulus, we can derive the expression for the composite modulus as follows:

$E_C$ = (stress in composite) / (strain in composite)

$E_C$ = (stress in matrix) / (strain in composite)

$E_C$ = (stress in fibers) / (strain in composite)

$E_C$ = (stress in composite) / [(strain in matrix) + (strain in fibers)]

$E_C$ = (stress in composite) / [(stress in composite) / $E_m$ + (stress in composite) / $E_f$]

$E_C$ = 1 / [(1 / $E_m$) + (1 / $E_f$)]

$E_C$ = 1 / [(1-f) / $E_m$ + f / $E_f$]

Therefore, the correct answer is: (D) 1/$E_C$ = [f/$E_m$] + (1-f)/$E_f$

The correct answer is (D) 1050 MPa.

The flow stress (σ) of an alloy varies with strain rate (ε) as σ = 100* $(ε)^(0.1)$ MPa.

When the alloy is hot extruded from 10 cm diameter to 5 cm diameter at a speed of 2 cm/s, the strain rate can be calculated as:

ε = (2 cm/s) / (5 cm) = 0.4 s^-1

Therefore, the flow stress during hot extrusion is 105 MPa.

The correct answer is:

(C) 165 MPa

Explanation:

The Hall-Petch equation is used to calculate the yield strength of a material as a function of its grain size. The equation is given by:

$$\sigma_y = \sigma_0 + kd^{-1/2}$$

where $\sigma_y$ is the yield strength, $\sigma_0$ is the lattice frictional stress, $k$ is the Hall-Petch constant, and $d$ is the grain size.

In this case, we are given the lattice frictional stress $\sigma_0 = 100$ MN/$m^2$ and the Hall-Petch constant $k = 0.10$ MN/$m^{1.5}$. We are also given the grain size in ASTM No. 6, which corresponds to a grain size of approximately 100 $\mu$m.

Substituting these values into the Hall-Petch equation, we get:

$$\sigma_y = 100 + 0.10 \times (100 \times 10^{-6})^{-1/2}$$

$$\sigma_y = 100 + 0.10 \times 1000$$

$$\sigma_y = 100 + 100$$

$$\sigma_y = 200$$ MN/$m^2$

Converting this to MPa, we get:

$$\sigma_y = 200 \times 10^6$$ Pa

$$\sigma_y = 200$ MPa

Therefore, the yield strength of the material is approximately 200 MPa.

Mechanical,28,G-META-13-33,MCQS-NUM,49,The yield strength of a polycrystalline metal increases from 100 MPa to 145 MPa on decreasing the grain size from 64 µm to 25 µm. The yield strength of this metal (in MPa) having a grain size of 36 µm is  (A) 110 (B) 125 (C) 140 (D) 165,"

The given information is:

- Yield strength of the metal increases from 100 MPa to 145 MPa on decreasing the grain size from 64 µm to 25 µm.
- The yield strength of the metal having a grain size of 36 µm is to be determined.

To solve this problem, we can use the Hall-Petch equation, which relates the yield strength of a material to its grain size. The equation is:

σ_y = σ_0 + k * d^(-1/2)

where:

- σ_y is the yield strength of the material
- σ_0 is a constant that depends on the material
- k is a constant that depends on the material
- d is the grain size

We can use the given information to determine the values of σ_0 and k. We have two data points:

- When d = 64 µm, σ_y = 100 MPa
- When d = 25 µm, σ_y = 145 MPa

We can substitute these values into the Hall-Petch equation to get two equations:

100 = σ_0 + k * 64^(-1/2)
145 = σ_0 + k * 25^(-1/2)

We can solve these equations to get:

σ_0 = 90.6 MPa
k = 1.45 MPa * µm^(1/2)

Now we can use these values to determine the yield strength of the metal having a grain size of 36 µm. We can substitute d = 36 µm into the Hall-Petch equation to get:

σ_y = 90.6 + 1.45 * 36^(-1/2)
σ_y = 110.3 MPa

Therefore, the yield strength of the metal having a grain size of 36 µm is 110.3 MPa.

The correct answer is (A) 110.

Here are the steps I took to solve this problem:

1. I used the Hall-Petch equation to relate the yield strength of a material to its grain size.
2. I used the given information to determine the values of σ_0 and k.
3. I used the values of σ_0 and k to determine the yield strength of the metal having a grain size of 36 µm.

Here is the code I used to solve this problem:

python
Copy code
# Define the Hall-Petch equation
def hall_petch(d, sigma_0, k):
    return sigma_0 + k * d**(-1/2)

# Define the data points

d2 = 25
sigma_y2 = 145

# Solve for sigma_0 and k

(B) The driving force for grain growth is the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material. (C) Higher the temperature, the faster is the grain growth. (D) Impurity atoms segregated at grain boundaries can retard grain growth","

The correct answer is (A) As the average grain size increases, the grain boundary energy per unit area decreases.

Explanation:

Grain growth is a process in which the average grain size of a material increases over time. The driving force for grain growth is the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material. As the average grain size increases, the grain boundary energy per unit volume decreases, but the grain boundary energy per unit area remains constant.

Higher the temperature, the faster is the grain growth, as the diffusion of atoms across the grain boundaries is faster at higher temperatures. Impurity atoms segregated at grain boundaries can retard grain growth by pinning the grain boundaries and preventing their movement.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is (A) As the average grain size increases, the grain boundary energy per unit area decreases.

The correct answer is (C).

The true strain is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final gauge length to the initial gauge length.

Let's denote the initial gauge length as L0 and the final gauge length as Lf.

The true strain is given as:

True Strain = ln(Lf / L0)

Substituting the given values, we have:

0.405 = ln(Lf / L0)

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

e^0.405 = Lf / L0

Rearranging the equation, we have:

Lf = L0 * e^0.405

Since the change in gauge length is 5 mm, we can calculate the initial gauge length as:

L0 = 5 mm / 0.405

Substituting this value into the equation for Lf, we get:

Lf = (5 mm / 0.405) * e^0.405

Simplifying the expression, we obtain:

Lf = 15.002 mm

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the final gauge length of the specimen is approximately 15 mm.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 15 mm.

The densities of glass fibre and epoxy are $2.58 g/cm^3$ and 1.14 $g/cm^3$, respectively.","

The elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction can be calculated using the rule of mixtures. The rule of mixtures states that the elastic modulus of the composite is a weighted average of the elastic moduli of the constituent materials, with the weighting factors being the volume fractions of the constituents.

The volume fraction of the glass fibres in the composite can be calculated as:

$V_f = \frac{w_f / \rho_f}{w_f / \rho_f + w_m / \rho_m}$

where $w_f$ and $w_m$ are the weight fractions of the glass fibres and the epoxy matrix, respectively, and $\rho_f$ and $\rho_m$ are the densities of the glass fibres and the epoxy matrix, respectively.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$V_f = \frac{0.6 / 2.58}{0.6 / 2.58 + 0.4 / 1.14} = 0.67$

The elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction can then be calculated as:

$E_c = E_f V_f + E_m (1 - V_f)$

where $E_f$ and $E_m$ are the elastic moduli of the glass fibres and the epoxy matrix, respectively.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$E_c = 72.5 \times 0.67 + 2.4 \times (1 - 0.67) = 49.2 GPa$

Therefore, the elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction is 49.2 GPa.

The stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass is 200 MPa in an alloy when the interprecipitate spacing is 500 nm. In the same alloy, if the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm, the stress required (in MPa) is?

Answer: 500

Explanation:

The stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass is given by the Orowan equation:

σ = Gb/λ

where σ is the stress required, G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector, and λ is the inter-precipitate spacing.

In the given problem, the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass is 200 MPa when the inter-precipitate spacing is 500 nm. To find the stress required when the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm, we can use the Orowan equation and solve for σ:

σ = Gb/λ

σ = (200 MPa)(500 nm)/(200 nm)

σ = 500 MPa

Therefore, the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass when the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm is 500 MPa.

The correct answer is: (A) Small grain size

Explanation:

Creep resistance is the ability of a material to resist deformation under constant stress at high temperatures. The factors that affect creep resistance include grain size, dispersoid size, stacking fault energy, and melting point.

Small grain size increases creep resistance because it reduces the number of grain boundaries, which are the weak points in the material. Fine dispersoid size also increases creep resistance by providing obstacles to dislocation movement. High stacking fault energy decreases creep resistance because it allows for easier dislocation movement. High melting point increases creep resistance because it increases the strength of the material.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Small grain size.

The correct answer is (C) 30.1.

Explanation:

The elastic modulus of a composite material along the transverse direction can be calculated using the rule of mixtures, which is given by:

In this case, we have:

V_f = 0.4
V_m = 1 - V_f = 0.6
E_f = 70 GPa
E_m = 3.5 GPa

Pick the correct answer based on the information provided above: Note: The glass fibre contains a population of flaws of different lengths.  (A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture (B) The fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture (D) The fibre will undergo buckling","

The correct answer is (A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture.

Explanation:

The given information is:

Glass fibre diameter: 5 micron (5 x 10^-6 m)
Tensile stress: 20 MPa (20 x 10^6 Pa)
Surface energy: 0.3 $Jm^(-2)$
Elastic modulus: 70 GPa (70 x 10^9 Pa)

To determine whether the fibre will undergo brittle fracture, we need to compare the applied stress to the theoretical strength of the material. The theoretical strength of a material is the maximum stress it can withstand before breaking.

The theoretical strength of a material can be calculated using the Griffith equation:

$$\sigma_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma}{d}}$$

where:

$\sigma_f$ is the theoretical strength (in Pa)
$E$ is the elastic modulus (in Pa)
$\gamma$ is the surface energy (in J/m^2)
$d$ is the diameter of the fibre (in m)

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

$$\sigma_f = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 70 \times 10^9 \times 0.3}{5 \times 10^{-6}}} = 1.2 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}$$

Since the applied stress (20 MPa) is less than the theoretical strength (1.2 GPa), the fibre will not undergo brittle fracture.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture.

To calculate the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement, we use the following equation:

$𝑓_𝑓 = 𝑉_𝑓 𝐸_𝑓 / 𝐸_𝑐$

Substituting the values, we get:

$𝑓_𝑓 = 0.25 × 250 / 65.75 = 0.93$

Therefore, the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement is 0.93, or 93%.

The correct answer is (A) larger grain size and lower temperature.

Explanation:

Nabarro-Herring creep is favored over Coble creep when the grain size is larger and the temperature is lower. This is because Nabarro-Herring creep is a bulk diffusion process, while Coble creep is a grain boundary diffusion process. Bulk diffusion is more efficient at lower temperatures and larger grain sizes, while grain boundary diffusion is more efficient at higher temperatures and smaller grain sizes.

The correct answer is: (B) High strain-rate sensitivity

Explanation:

Superplasticity is a phenomenon in which a material can undergo large amounts of plastic deformation without fracturing. One of the requirements for a material to exhibit superplasticity is a high strain-rate sensitivity. This means that the material's flow stress (the stress required to cause plastic deformation) is highly dependent on the strain rate (the rate at which the material is deformed).

In other words, a material with high strain-rate sensitivity will exhibit a significant increase in flow stress as the strain rate increases. This is important for superplasticity because it allows the material to resist necking (localized deformation) and maintain a uniform deformation throughout the material.

The other options are not directly related to superplasticity:

(A) Coarse-grained microstructure: Superplasticity is typically associated with fine-grained microstructures, as the small grain size allows for easier grain boundary sliding and diffusion, which are important mechanisms for superplastic deformation.

(C) Low strain-hardening exponent: The strain-hardening exponent is a measure of how the material's flow stress changes with increasing strain. While a low strain-hardening exponent may be beneficial for some applications, it is not a requirement for superplasticity.

(D) High modulus of elasticity: The modulus of elasticity is a measure of a material's stiffness. While a high modulus of elasticity may be desirable for certain applications, it is not a requirement for superplasticity.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) High strain-rate sensitivity.

The sequence of precipitation during aging of Al -4 wt.% Cu alloy is:

1. GP zone: The first stage of precipitation is the formation of Guinier-Preston (GP) zones. These are small clusters of copper atoms that form in the aluminum matrix.

2. θ`: The second stage of precipitation is the formation of θ` (theta prime) precipitates. These are small, coherent precipitates that form in the aluminum matrix.

3. θ``: The third stage of precipitation is the formation of θ`` (theta double prime) precipitates. These are larger, incoherent precipitates that form in the aluminum matrix.

The correct answer is (C) GP zone  → θ`  → θ``  → θ.

Here are some additional details about the sequence of precipitation during aging of Al -4 wt.% Cu alloy:

The correct answer is: (A) The minimum creep rate is obtained in the primary stage (stage I)

Explanation:

The primary stage (stage I) of creep deformation is characterized by a decreasing creep rate, which is the opposite of the minimum creep rate. The minimum creep rate is typically observed in the secondary stage (stage II) of creep deformation, where the creep rate is relatively constant.

The other options are all true statements about creep deformation:

(B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size: This is because smaller grain sizes provide more grain boundaries for dislocations to move through, which can lead to increased creep deformation.

(C) Coble creep occurs via grain boundary diffusion: Coble creep is a type of creep deformation that occurs via grain boundary diffusion, where atoms diffuse along grain boundaries to accommodate the applied stress.

(D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion: Nabarro-Herring creep is a type of creep deformation that occurs via lattice diffusion, where atoms diffuse through the lattice to accommodate the applied stress.

The correct answer is (C) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = σ.

Explanation:

Necking instability occurs when the true stress-strain curve reaches a maximum point, which is the point where the slope of the curve is zero. This means that the rate of change of true stress with respect to true strain is zero, or 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = 0.

However, the question is asking about the condition for necking instability in a material that undergoes strain hardening. In this case, the true stress-strain curve does not reach a maximum point, but instead continues to increase with increasing strain. The condition for necking instability in this case is when the slope of the true stress-strain curve is equal to the true stress, or 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = σ.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = σ.

The correct answer is (A) 8.32 N.

Explanation:

The force exerted on the steel ball is given by the equation:

F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2)

where:

- f is the friction factor, which is given as 0.2
- π is the mathematical constant pi, which is approximately 3.14
- $R^(2)$ is the square of the radius of the steel ball, which is not given in the question
- $ρ_(Al)$ is the density of the liquid Al, which is given as 2360 kg/$m^(3)$
- $v^2$ is the square of the velocity of the liquid Al, which is not given in the question

To solve for the force, we need to know the radius of the steel ball and the velocity of the liquid Al.

Let's assume that the radius of the steel ball is 1 cm (0.01 m) and the velocity of the liquid Al is 1 m/s.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

F = 0.2 π (0.01 m)^(2) (2360 kg/$m^(3)$ (1 m/s)^(2) /2)

F = 0.2 π (0.0001 m^(2)) (2360 kg/$m^(3)$ (1 m^(2)/s^(2)) /2)

F = 0.2 π (0.0001 m^(2)) (1180 kg m^(2)/s^(2))

F = 0.2 π (0.0001 m^(2)) (1180 N)

F = 0.0002 π (1180 N)

F = 0.74 N

Therefore, the force exerted on the steel ball is 0.74 N.

The force exerted on the steel ball is given by the equation:

F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2)

- π is the mathematical constant pi, which is approximately 3.14
- $R^(2)$ is the square of the radius of the steel ball, which is not given in the question
- $ρ_(Al)$ is the density of the liquid Al, which is given as 2360 kg/$m^(3)$
- $v^2$ is the square of the velocity of the liquid Al, which is not given in the question

To solve for the force, we need to know the radius of the steel ball and the velocity of the liquid Al.

Let's assume that the radius of the steel ball is 1 cm (0.01 m) and the velocity of the liquid Al is 1 m/s.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

F = 0.2 π (0.01 m)^(2) (2360 kg/$m^(3)$ (1 m/s)^(2) /2)

F = 0.2 π (0.0001 m^(2)) (2360 kg/$m^(3)$ (1 m^(2)/s^(2)) /2)

F = 0.2 π (0.0001 m^(2)) (1180 kg m^(2)/s^(2))

F = 0.2 π (0.0001 m^(2)) (1180 N)

F = 0.0002 π (1180 N)

F = 0.74 N

Therefore, the force exerted on the steel ball is 0.74 N.

The correct answer is: (C) 609 MPa

Explanation:

The strain hardening behavior of an annealed rod during cold rolling is given by the equation σ = 700 $(ε)^0.2$ MPa, where σ is the flow stress at strain ε.

To find the flow stress after 50% reduction in area of the annealed rod on cold rolling, we need to calculate the true strain ε.

The true strain ε is related to the reduction in area by the equation:

ε = ln(A0/A1)

where A0 is the initial area and A1 is the final area after reduction.

In this case, the reduction in area is 50%, so A1 = 0.5A0.

Substituting this into the equation for true strain, we get:

ε = ln(A0/0.5A0) = ln(2) = 0.693

Now, we can substitute this value of ε into the equation for flow stress to find the flow stress after 50% reduction in area:

σ = 700 $(0.693)^0.2$ MPa = 609 MPa

Therefore, the flow stress after 50% reduction in area of the annealed rod on cold rolling is approximately 609 MPa.

The correct answer is (C) 327.

Here's the explanation:

The theoretical fracture strength of a brittle material can be estimated using the Griffith equation:

where:

σ_f is the theoretical fracture strength (in MPa)
E is Young's modulus (in GPa)
γ is the surface energy (in J/$m^2$)

The maximum possible reduction in hot rolling is given by the formula:

maximum reduction = 4Rsin^2(f/2)

where R is the roll radius and f is the coefficient of friction.

In this case, R = 720/2 = 360 mm and f = 0.5.

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction is:

maximum reduction = 4 * 360 * sin^2(0.5/2)

                      = 4 * 360 * sin^2(0.25)

(A) a is true but r is false (B) a is false but r is true (C) both a and r are true, and r is the reason for a (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a","

The correct answer is (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a.

Explanation:

The assertion (a) is true because the peak aging time for an Al-4 wt.% Cu alloy is indeed indicated by a maximum in the hardness. This is because the hardness of the alloy is directly related to the volume fraction of the θ precipitates, which are responsible for the hardening of the alloy.

The reason (r) is also true because the maximum volume fraction of the θ precipitates is formed at the peak aging time. This is because the θ precipitates are formed by a diffusion-controlled process, and the rate of diffusion is highest at the peak aging time.

However, the reason (r) is not the reason for the assertion (a). The reason for the assertion (a) is that the hardness of the alloy is directly related to the volume fraction of the θ precipitates. The reason (r) is simply a statement of fact about the θ precipitates.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a.

stressed surface of the glass undergoes a structural relaxation and the values of the near

are at or near the surface, this stress relaxation leads to a loss in strength. We observethat the strength for samples treated at 500 8C are significantly lower than those treated

The answer is 10.39 MPa.

Explanation:

The critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) is the minimum shear stress required to initiate slip in a crystal. In this case, the tensile stress is applied along the [100] direction in a FCC metal crystal, and the slip plane is (111).

To calculate the tensile stress required for initiating slip, we need to use the Schmid's law, which states that the resolved shear stress on a slip plane is proportional to the applied tensile stress. The proportionality constant is called the Schmid factor, which depends on the orientation of the slip plane and the slip direction.

For the (111) slip plane in a FCC crystal, the Schmid factor is 0.408. Therefore, the resolved shear stress on the slip plane is:

Resolved shear stress = Schmid factor * Applied tensile stress

To initiate slip, the resolved shear stress must be equal to the CRSS. Therefore, the applied tensile stress required for initiating slip is:

Applied tensile stress = CRSS / Schmid factor

Substituting the values, we get:

Applied tensile stress = 6 MPa / 0.408 = 14.7 MPa

Therefore, the tensile stress required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane in a FCC metal crystal with a CRSS of 6 MPa is 14.7 MPa.

The maximum possible reduction in a single pass for a plate of thickness h = 120 mm, cold rolled in a mill with a roll diameter of 200 mm and a coefficient of friction μ = 0.1, can be calculated using the following formula:

Δh = 2R(1 - cos(α))

where Δh is the maximum possible reduction, R is the roll diameter, and α is the angle of contact between the roll and the plate.

The angle of contact α can be calculated using the following formula:

α = arccos(1 - 2μ)

Substituting the given values, we get:

α = arccos(1 - 2*0.1) = 0.6435011087932844

Δh = 2*200*(1 - cos(0.6435011087932844)) = 10.000000000000002

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction in a single pass is 10.0 mm.

The correct answer is: (D) (-1 -1 1)[101]

Explanation:

To determine the slip system that will be activated first, we need to calculate the Schmid factor for each slip system. The Schmid factor is a measure of the resolved shear stress on a slip system, and the slip system with the highest Schmid factor will be activated first.

The Schmid factor is given by:

Schmid factor = cos(phi) * cos(lambda)

where phi is the angle between the slip plane normal and the loading axis, and lambda is the angle between the slip direction and the loading axis.

For the given slip systems, we can calculate the Schmid factor as follows:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]:

phi = cos^-1(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.26 degrees

lambda = cos^-1(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.26 degrees

Schmid factor = cos(35.26) * cos(35.26) = 0.58

(B) (-1 -1 1)[011]:

phi = cos^-1(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.26 degrees

lambda = cos^-1(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.26 degrees

Schmid factor = cos(35.26) * cos(35.26) = 0.58

(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]:

phi = cos^-1(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.26 degrees

lambda = cos^-1(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.26 degrees

Schmid factor = cos(35.26) * cos(35.26) = 0.58

(D) (-1 -1 1)[101]:

phi = cos^-1(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.26 degrees

lambda = cos^-1(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.26 degrees

Schmid factor = cos(35.26) * cos(35.26) = 0.58

Therefore, all four slip systems have the same Schmid factor, and any of them can be activated first.

(D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation","

The correct answer is (B).

Explanation:

A point defect can interact with both the hydrostatic and shear stress fields of a dislocation, but it is not necessarily spherically symmetric. The interaction energy between a point defect and a dislocation is given by the product of the stress field of the dislocation and the strain field of the point defect. The strain field of a point defect is not necessarily spherically symmetric, and it can depend on the type of defect and the crystal structure. Therefore, statement (B) is false.

The other statements are true:

(A) An oversized solute atom would preferentially migrate below the slip plane of an edge dislocation because the stress field of the dislocation is compressive above the slip plane and tensile below the slip plane.

(C) A point defect can locally modify the elastic modulus and thereby can change the interaction energy. This is because the presence of a point defect can change the local elastic properties of the material, which can affect the interaction energy between the point defect and the dislocation.

(D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation because the stress field of the dislocation is compressive in the region around the dislocation core.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).

","

The flow behavior of the Al alloy is given by the equation:

𝜎 = 350 $𝜖^(0.3)$ MPa

where 𝜎 is the flow stress and 𝜖 is the true strain.

The ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is given by the integral of the flow stress over the true strain:

W = ∫𝜎 d𝜖

Substituting the flow behavior equation, we get:

W = ∫350 $𝜖^(0.3)$ d𝜖

To find the limits of integration, we need to calculate the true strain for the given extrusion process. The true strain is given by:

𝜖 = ln(A0/A)

where A0 is the initial cross-sectional area and A is the final cross-sectional area.

For a cylindrical specimen, the cross-sectional area is given by:

A = πr^2

where r is the radius of the specimen.

Therefore, the true strain for the given extrusion process is:

𝜖 = ln((π(15)^2)/(π(10)^2)) = ln(2.25) = 0.81

Substituting the limits of integration, we get:

W = ∫350 $𝜖^(0.3)$ d𝜖 = 350 ∫0.81 $𝜖^(0.3)$ d𝜖 = 350 (0.81^(1.3) - 0) = 210.5

Therefore, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is 210.5 mega joules.

In the vulcanization of 50 g of natural rubber, 10 g of sulfur is added. Assuming the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is","

The given information is:

Atomic weight of Sulfur (S) = 32 amu
Molecular weight of a mer of natural rubber = 68 amu
Weight of natural rubber = 50 g
Weight of sulfur added = 10 g

To calculate the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected, we need to determine the number of moles of sulfur and the number of moles of natural rubber.

Number of moles of sulfur = (Weight of sulfur) / (Atomic weight of sulfur)
                             = 10 g / 32 amu
                             = 0.3125 moles

Number of moles of natural rubber = (Weight of natural rubber) / (Molecular weight of a mer of natural rubber)
                                   = 50 g / 68 amu
                                   = 0.7353 moles

Assuming the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the maximum number of cross-linked sites that could be connected is equal to the number of moles of sulfur.

Maximum number of cross-linked sites = 0.3125 moles

To calculate the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites, we divide the maximum number of cross-linked sites by the total number of moles of natural rubber and multiply by 100.

(A) Increase in the gap between solidus and liquidus lines (B) Increase in the solubility of impurities in solid as compared to that in liquid phase (C) Agitation of melt (D) Low cooling rate of melt,"

The correct answer is (B) Increase in the solubility of impurities in solid as compared to that in liquid phase.

Explanation:

In zone refining, the impurities are separated from the melt by taking advantage of the difference in solubility of impurities in the solid and liquid phases. The impurities are more soluble in the liquid phase than in the solid phase. Therefore, when the melt is cooled, the impurities are rejected by the solidifying crystal and are concentrated in the remaining liquid. This process is repeated several times to achieve a high degree of purification.

Increasing the gap between the solidus and liquidus lines, agitating the melt, and decreasing the cooling rate of the melt all favor the separation of impurities in zone refining.

The correct answer is (B) Both statement-1 and Statement-2 are TRUE.

Explanation:

Statement-1: Sintering in vacuum leads to improved densification as compared to sintering under ambient (at atmospheric pressure) condition.

This statement is TRUE. Sintering in vacuum leads to improved densification because the absence of air or other gases in the vacuum environment allows for better diffusion of atoms and molecules, which leads to a more compact and dense material.

Statement-2: Closed pores formed during sintering inhibit full densification.

This statement is also TRUE. Closed pores formed during sintering can trap gases and prevent the material from fully densifying. This can lead to a less dense and weaker material.

Therefore, both statement-1 and Statement-2 are TRUE.

Let P(n) denote the probability that there will be no accident over a period of ‘n’ months. Assume that the events of individual months are independent of each other. The smallest integer value of ‘n’ such that P(n) ≤ ½ is? (round off to the nearest integer) ","

The given information states that the probability of an accident occurring in a given month is 1/100, and we are interested in finding the smallest integer value of 'n' such that the probability of no accident over a period of 'n' months is less than or equal to 1/2.

Let's denote the probability of an accident occurring in a given month as 'p'. Then, the probability of no accident in a given month is 1 - p.

Since the events of individual months are independent, the probability of no accident over a period of 'n' months is given by:

P(n) = (1 - p)^n

Substituting the value of p as 1/100, we have:

P(n) = (1 - 1/100)^n

Now, we want to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ 1/2. We can solve this by trial and error or by using a calculator.

Let's try different values of 'n' and see when P(n) becomes less than or equal to 1/2:

P(1) = (1 - 1/100)^1 = 0.99
P(2) = (1 - 1/100)^2 = 0.9801
P(3) = (1 - 1/100)^3 = 0.970299
P(4) = (1 - 1/100)^4 = 0.96059601
P(5) = (1 - 1/100)^5 = 0.9509800999
P(6) = (1 - 1/100)^6 = 0.941453999901
P(7) = (1 - 1/100)^7 = 0.93201689990001
P(8) = (1 - 1/100)^8 = 0.9226678999000001
P(9) = (1 - 1/100)^9 = 0.9134060999000001
P(10) = (1 - 1/100)^10 = 0.9042305999000001

We can see that P(10) is the smallest integer value of 'n' for which P(n) ≤ 1/2.

Therefore, the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ 1/2 is 10.

The given information is:

Theoretical density of the ceramic: 6.76 g/cm^3
Sintered density of the ceramic: 6.60 g/cm^3
Volume percent porosity of the green compact: 18%
Side of the sintered cube: 2 cm

To find the required side of the cubic green compact, we need to calculate the volume of the sintered cube and the volume of the green compact.

Volume of the sintered cube:

V_sintered = (side)^3
V_sintered = (2 cm)^3
V_sintered = 8 cm^3

Volume of the green compact:

V_green = (side)^3

To find the side of the green compact, we need to calculate the volume of the green compact. We can use the given information about the volume percent porosity to find the volume of the green compact.

Volume percent porosity = (volume of pores / total volume) * 100

18% = (volume of pores / total volume) * 100

0.18 = (volume of pores / total volume)

volume of pores = 0.18 * total volume

volume of pores = 0.18 * V_green

V_green = (volume of pores) / 0.18

V_green = (0.18 * V_green) / 0.18

V_green = V_green

Therefore, the volume of the green compact is equal to the volume of the sintered cube.

V_green = V_sintered

V_green = 8 cm^3

Side of the green compact:

side = (V_green)^(1/3)

side = (8 cm^3)^(1/3)

side = 2 cm

Therefore, the required side of the cubic green compact is 2 cm.

Answer: 2 cm

The correct answer is (D) Radiation, conduction, and convection.

Explanation:

When hot metal is poured into a sand mold, heat loss occurs through radiation, conduction, and convection.

Radiation: The hot metal emits thermal radiation, which is absorbed by the surrounding environment, including the sand mold.

Conduction: Heat is transferred from the hot metal to the sand mold through direct contact, which is a form of conduction.

Convection: The hot metal also loses heat through convection, as the surrounding air is heated and rises, carrying away some of the heat.

Therefore, all three modes of heat transfer are involved in the cooling of the hot metal in a sand mold.

The correct answer is (C) After casting solidifies.

Explanation:

In the context of sand casting, a riser is a reservoir of molten metal that is designed to solidify after the casting. The purpose of the riser is to provide additional metal to the casting as it solidifies, compensating for the shrinkage that occurs during the solidification process.

The riser is typically located at the top of the casting and is connected to the casting through a gate or runner. As the casting solidifies, the riser remains liquid and continues to feed molten metal into the casting, preventing the formation of voids or shrinkage defects.

The riser is designed to solidify after the casting to ensure that there is sufficient metal available to compensate for the shrinkage that occurs during solidification. If the riser solidifies before the casting, it will not be able to provide the necessary metal to the casting, resulting in defects.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) After casting solidifies.

The given equation for the sulphide capacity ($C_S$) of the liquid slag is:

log $C_S$ = 3.44* [$X_(CaO)$ + 0.1*$X_(MgO)$ - 0.8*$X_(Al_2O_3)$ - $X_(SiO_2)$] - (9894/T) + 2.05

where $X$ represents the mole fraction of the respective components, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

To calculate the value of $C_S$ at 1900 K, we need to substitute the given values into the equation:

$X_(CaO)$ = 55/100 = 0.55
$X_(MgO)$ = 10/100 = 0.1
$X_(Al_2O_3)$ = 15/100 = 0.15
$X_(SiO_2)$ = 20/100 = 0.2
$T$ = 1900 K

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

log $C_S$ = 3.44* [0.55 + 0.1*0.1 - 0.8*0.15 - 0.2] - (9894/1900) + 2.05
log $C_S$ = 3.44* [0.55 + 0.01 - 0.12 - 0.2] - 5.207368 + 2.05
log $C_S$ = 3.44* [0.24] - 5.207368 + 2.05
log $C_S$ = 0.8256 - 5.207368 + 2.05
log $C_S$ = -2.328768

Taking the antilog of both sides, we get:

$C_S$ = 10^(-2.328768)
$C_S$ = 0.0047

Therefore, the value of $C_S$ at 1900 K is approximately 0.0047.

The correct answer is (B) 0.009.

The correct answer is (B) suppresses the solution-loss reaction.

Explanation:

High top pressure in a blast furnace operation suppresses the solution-loss reaction. The solution-loss reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs in the blast furnace, where iron oxide reacts with carbon monoxide to form iron and carbon dioxide. This reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. However, high top pressure in the blast furnace can suppress this reaction by reducing the partial pressure of carbon monoxide, which is a reactant in the solution-loss reaction. This can lead to a decrease in the rate of the reaction and a decrease in the amount of iron produced.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) suppresses the solution-loss reaction.

Phospho- rus is present in most cast irons as a low melting point phosphide eutectic which improves the fluidity of the iron by lengthening the solidification period; this favours the decomposition of cementite. Grey cast iron is used for a wide variety of applications because of its good strength/cost ratio. It is easily cast into intri- cate shapes and has good machinability, since the chips break off easily at the graphite flakes. It also has a high damping capacity and hence is used for lathe and other machine frames where vibrations need to be damped out. The limited strength and ductility of grey cast iron may be improved by small additions of the car- bide formers (Cr, Mo) which reduce the flake size and refine the pearlite.

(A) a is true but r is false (B) a is false but r is true (C) both a and r are true, and r is the reason for a (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a","

The correct answer is (A) a is true but r is false.

Explanation:

The assertion is true. Hydrometallurgical processes are commonly used for the extraction of metal values from their sulphide concentrates. One such process is leaching with oxygen under high pressure. This process is known as pressure oxidation or autoclave leaching.

However, the reason provided is false. The presence of oxygen under high pressure does not cause roasting of sulphides. Roasting is a thermal process that involves heating the sulphide concentrate in the presence of air or oxygen to convert the sulphides into oxides. This process is typically carried out at temperatures above 500°C.

In pressure oxidation, the sulphide concentrate is leached with oxygen under high pressure and temperature. The oxygen reacts with the sulphides to form sulphuric acid and metal oxides. The metal oxides are then leached with acid to extract the metal values.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) a is true but r is false.

The solidified thickness after 4 minutes can be calculated using Chvorinov's rule, which states that the solidification time is proportional to the square of the thickness of the solidified layer.

Let's denote the solidified thickness after 2 minutes as x1 and the solidified thickness after 4 minutes as x2.

According to Chvorinov's rule, we have:

t1 / t2 = (x1 / x2)^2

Substituting the given values, we get:

2 / 4 = (3 / x2)^2

Solving for x2, we get:

x2 = 3 * sqrt(4 / 2)

x2 = 3 * sqrt(2)

x2 ≈ 4.24 cm

Therefore, the solidified thickness after 4 minutes is approximately 4.24 cm.

Again, slag is removed and melt (at about 1650 /C01700
/C14C) tapped into a
ladle; the furnace is typically tilted for this purpose. After the furnace istapped, a new charge is added and the process repeated, without cool downof the furnace. The BOF is very efficient, converting pig iron to steel in ashort time (e.g., B40 min for 250 ton charge). A challenge in BOF steel
making is control of the quantity of dissolved oxygen in the melt. When thecarbon content of the melt drops, the oxygen that is added begins to dissolve
more readily into the melt. Ultimately, this oxygen needs to be removed in a
subsequent production step, as described below.

The correct answer is (D) Calendaring.

Explanation:

Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is poured into a mold, allowed to solidify, and then removed to create a desired shape. The process involves several operations, including gating, fettling, and stack molding. However, calendaring is not associated with casting.

Calendaring is a process used in the manufacturing of paper, plastic, and rubber products. It involves passing a material through a series of rollers to create a smooth, uniform thickness. This process is not used in casting, as it is not necessary to create a smooth surface on the final product.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Calendaring.

The average mould flux can be calculated by integrating the mould heat flux equation over the length of the mould and dividing by the length of the mould.

The mould heat flux equation is:

q_m(z) = [2.67 - 0.33(z/U_c)^0.5] * 10^6

The length of the mould is L_m = 0.8 m.

The casting speed is U_c = 0.2 m/s.

The average mould flux can be calculated as:

q_m_avg = (1/L_m) * int(q_m(z), z=0..L_m)

q_m_avg = (1/0.8) * int([2.67 - 0.33(z/0.2)^0.5] * 10^6, z=0..0.8)

The slag produced during refining contains 40 wt.% CaO and 22 wt.% FeO. Neglecting material losses, the yield of Fe (in %) is?","

The yield of Fe in the BOF steelmaking process can be calculated as follows:

Let's assume that the initial mass of hot metal is 100 metric ton (100,000 kg) and the mass of lime used is 5 metric ton (5,000 kg).

The mass of Fe in the hot metal can be calculated as:

Fe mass = 100,000 kg * 0.932 = 93,200 kg

The mass of CaO in the lime can be calculated as:

CaO mass = 5,000 kg * 0.9 = 4,500 kg

The mass of FeO in the slag can be calculated as:

FeO mass = 100,000 kg * 0.22 = 22,000 kg

The mass of CaO in the slag can be calculated as:

CaO mass = 100,000 kg * 0.4 = 40,000 kg

The mass of Fe in the slag can be calculated as:

Fe mass = 22,000 kg * 0.78 = 17,160 kg

The mass of Fe in the final product can be calculated as:

Fe mass = 93,200 kg - 17,160 kg = 76,040 kg

The yield of Fe can be calculated as:

Yield = (76,040 kg / 93,200 kg) * 100% = 81.58%

So, the yield of Fe in the BOF steelmaking process is 81.58%.

The correct answer is (A) make the surface of the mineral hydrophobic.

Explanation:

In froth flotation, the primary purpose of adding collectors is to make the surface of the mineral hydrophobic. This is because the hydrophobic surface of the mineral will attach to the air bubbles, which will then rise to the surface and form a froth. The froth can then be skimmed off, leaving the desired mineral behind.

The other options are incorrect because:

(B) make the surface of the mineral hydrophilic: This is not the primary purpose of adding collectors in froth flotation.

(C) stabilize the froth: This is not the primary purpose of adding collectors in froth flotation.

(A) The lower atomic weight element is leached (B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached (C) The more electronegative element is leached (D) The element with lower density is leached,"

The correct answer is (B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached.

Explanation:

Selective leaching, also known as dealloying, is a process in which one element of a binary alloy is preferentially removed, leaving behind a porous structure of the other element. The element that is leached out is typically the one with higher diffusivity, as it is more mobile and can more easily diffuse through the alloy.

The atomic weight, electronegativity, and density of the elements do not directly affect the selective leaching process. Instead, it is the diffusivity of the elements that determines which one will be leached out.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached.

Material manufacturing,59,G-META-21-10,MCQS,41,Which one of the following is the correct decreasing sequence of Quenching Power for quenchants used in heat treatment of steels?  (A) Oil> Water> Brine> Air (B) Brine> Oil> Water> Air (C) Brine> Water> Oil> Air (D) Water> Brine> Oil> Air,"

The correct answer is (C) Brine> Water> Oil> Air.

Explanation:

Quenching power refers to the ability of a quenchant to rapidly cool a hot metal, such as steel, during heat treatment. The quenching power of a quenchant is determined by its ability to remove heat from the metal and its ability to prevent distortion or cracking of the metal during cooling.

The quenching power of a quenchant is typically measured by its cooling rate, which is the rate at which the temperature of the metal decreases during quenching. The cooling rate is affected by several factors, including the temperature of the quenchant, the thermal conductivity of the quenchant, and the agitation of the quenchant.

The quenching power of a quenchant is also affected by the type of metal being quenched. For example, steels with higher carbon content require more rapid cooling to achieve the desired hardness and strength, while steels with lower carbon content can be quenched more slowly.

The quenching power of a quenchant can be ranked in the following order, from highest to lowest:

1. Brine: Brine is a solution of salt and water that is commonly used as a quenchant in heat treatment. Brine has a high thermal conductivity and a high cooling rate, making it an effective quenchant for steels with high carbon content.

2. Water: Water is a common quenchant that is used for a wide range of metals. Water has a lower thermal conductivity and a slower cooling rate than brine, but it is still an effective quenchant for many steels.

3. Oil: Oil is a common quenchant that is used for a wide range of metals. Oil has a lower thermal conductivity and a slower cooling rate than water, but it is still an effective quenchant for many steels.

4. Air: Air is a common quenchant that is used for a wide range of metals. Air has a very low thermal conductivity and a very slow cooling rate, making it an ineffective quenchant for most steels.

Therefore, the correct decreasing sequence of Quenching Power for quenchants used in heat treatment of steels is (C) Brine> Water> Oil> Air.

The weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal respectively, are: (Assume that the gangue materials of the ore and ash content of coke form slag while $Fe_(2)O_3$ in the ore is consumed in making hot metal)  (A) 1705 kg, 431 kg (B) 2131kg, 546 kg (C) 1705kg, 331kg (D) 1500kg, 431kg","

The given information is:

Atomic weight:
- Oxygen (O): 16
- Carbon (C): 12
- Nitrogen (N): 14
- Iron (Fe): 56

Compositions are in weight percent (wt.%).

1 ton = 1000 kg

Blast furnace details:
- Hematite ore ($Fe_2O_3$): 80%
- Gangue materials: 20%
- Coke used: 600 kg per ton of hot metal
- Coke composition: 85% C, 15% ash
- Hot metal composition: 95.5% Fe, 4.5% C

To calculate the weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal, we need to consider the following:

1. The gangue materials in the ore and the ash content of coke form slag.
2. $Fe_2O_3$ in the ore is consumed in making hot metal.

Let's calculate the weight of iron ore used per ton of hot metal:

- Weight of hot metal: 1000 kg
- Weight of iron in hot metal: 95.5% of 1000 kg = 955 kg
- Weight of $Fe_2O_3$ required to produce 955 kg of iron:
  - Molecular weight of $Fe_2O_3$: 2 * 56 + 3 * 16 = 160
  - Weight of $Fe_2O_3$ required: (955 kg / 2) * (160 / 56) = 1403.57 kg

Since the ore contains 80% $Fe_2O_3$, the weight of iron ore used per ton of hot metal is:

Weight of iron ore used = 1403.57 kg / 0.8 = 1754.46 kg

Now, let's calculate the weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal:

- Weight of gangue materials in the ore: 20% of 1754.46 kg = 350.89 kg
- Weight of ash in coke: 15% of 600 kg = 90 kg

Total weight of slag produced = 350.89 kg + 90 kg = 440.89 kg

Therefore, the weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal are:

- Weight of iron ore used: 1754.46 kg
- Weight of slag produced: 440.89 kg

The closest option to these values is (A) 1705 kg, 431 kg.

Material manufacturing,65,G-META-22-19,MCQS,28,Which one of the following elements has the slowest removal rate from hot metal in basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking?  (A) Carbon (B) Sulfur (C) Silicon (D) Phosphorus ,"

The correct answer is: (D) Phosphorus

Here's the explanation:

Phosphorus has the slowest removal rate from hot metal in basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking. This is because phosphorus has a high affinity for oxygen and forms a stable oxide (P2O5) that is difficult to remove from the hot metal. Carbon, sulfur, and silicon are more easily removed from the hot metal because they form less stable oxides.

Here are some relevant passages from the given context:

""The selective oxidation of phosphorus from molten iron, an important reaction in steelmaking, demonstrates the effect of changing the activities. It is apparent from Figure 11.1 that the selective oxidation of phosphorus is not possible when the metal and metal oxide are in their standard states because the line for phosphorus lies above that of iron at the temperatures at which the reaction would be performed (~1600 °C).

When this value is substituted in Equation 11.6 it has the effect of rotating line (a) to position (b) so that it now lies well below line (x) for pure Fe/pure FeO. This means that the phosphorus can now be oxidised selectively from the iron. A complication is that FeO also dissolves in the slag.

2. High partial pressure of oxygen: The presence of oxygen is necessary for the oxidation of the metal sulphide to occur. A high partial pressure of oxygen promotes the oxidation reaction and favors the formation of the metal oxide.

3. Use of excess air: The use of excess air in the roasting process provides a sufficient supply of oxygen to promote the oxidation reaction.

4. High partial pressure of $SO_3$: The presence of $SO_3$ in the roasting process can promote the formation of sulphates. However, it is not a necessary condition for sulphate formation.

The correct answer is (D) Lower temperature.

Explanation:

In the BOF steelmaking process, the removal of phosphorus is achieved by oxidizing it to form P2O5, which is then absorbed by the slag. The effectiveness of phosphorus removal depends on several factors, including the FeO level in the slag, the basicity of the slag, and the temperature.

Higher FeO level in the slag is desirable for effective phosphorus removal because it increases the activity of P2O5 in the slag, making it more effective at absorbing phosphorus.

Higher basicity of the slag is also desirable because it increases the activity of P2O5 in the slag, making it more effective at absorbing phosphorus.

Higher temperature is desirable for effective phosphorus removal because it increases the rate of the oxidation reaction, making it more effective at removing phosphorus.

Lower temperature, on the other hand, is not desirable for effective phosphorus removal because it decreases the rate of the oxidation reaction, making it less effective at removing phosphorus.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Lower temperature.

During the roasting of a sulfide ore of a metal M, the possible solid phases are M, MS, MO and $MSO_4$. Assuming that both $SO_2$ and $O_2$ are always present in the roaster, the solid phases that can co-exist at thermodynamic equilibrium are M, $MSO_4$.

This is because the roasting process involves the oxidation of the sulfide ore to form the metal oxide and sulfur dioxide gas. The metal oxide can then react with the sulfur dioxide gas to form the metal sulfate. Therefore, the solid phases that can co-exist at thermodynamic equilibrium are M, $MSO_4$.

Material manufacturing,75,G-META-16-53,MCQS-NUM,42,"[The mould constant is 2 s/$mm^2$.] For casting a cylindrical aluminum bloom having a length of 1000 mm and diameter of 750 mm, the approximate solidification time (in minutes) estimated using Chvorinov’s rule is   (A) 45 (B) 316 (C) 440 (D) 620 ","

The correct answer is (C) 440.

Explanation:

Chvorinov's rule is a formula used to estimate the solidification time of a casting based on its volume and surface area. The formula is given by:

t = B * (V/A)^2

where:

t is the solidification time in minutes
B is the mould constant in minutes per square millimeter
V is the volume of the casting in cubic millimeters
A is the surface area of the casting in square millimeters

For the given cylindrical aluminum bloom, the volume and surface area can be calculated as:

V = π * (diameter/2)^2 * length = π * (750/2)^2 * 1000 = 44178647.4 mm^3
A = 2 * π * (diameter/2) * length + 2 * π * (diameter/2)^2 = 2 * π * (750/2) * 1000 + 2 * π * (750/2)^2 = 2356194.4 mm^2

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

t = 2 * (44178647.4/2356194.4)^2 = 440.1 minutes

Therefore, the approximate solidification time for the given cylindrical aluminum bloom is 440 minutes.

Given that c* = 0.04 wt.% and c( t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, the concentration of carbon in steel (in wt.%) at t= 1 min is? (answer up to three decimal places)","

The given equation is:

dC/dt = -(c-c*)

where c and c* are the instantaneous and equilibrium concentration of carbon in steel respectively, in units of wt.%.

Given that c* = 0.04 wt.% and c( t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, we can solve for c( t = 1 min) as follows:

dC/dt = -(c-c*)

dC = -(c-c*) dt

Integrating both sides:

∫dC = -∫(c-c*) dt

C = -(c-c*) t + C0

Substituting the given values:

c( t = 1 min) = -(0.4 - 0.04) (1 min) + 0.4

c( t = 1 min) = 0.36 wt.%

Therefore, the concentration of carbon in steel at t= 1 min is 0.36 wt.%.

The maximum possible reduction during cold rolling of a 250 mm thick slab of a nickel alloy using a roll of diameter 450 mm with an angle of bite of 10° is 10.61 mm.

The maximum possible reduction during cold rolling can be calculated using the following formula:

Maximum possible reduction = (2R * sin(α/2))^2 / (2R - h)

where:

R is the roll radius (225 mm)
α is the angle of bite (10°)
h is the initial thickness of the slab (250 mm)

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:

Maximum possible reduction = (2 * 225 * sin(10/2))^2 / (2 * 225 - 250)

= 10.61 mm

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction during cold rolling of a 250 mm thick slab of a nickel alloy using a roll of diameter 450 mm with an angle of bite of 10° is 10.61 mm.

Given the equilibrium sulphur partition ratio between slag and steel, [(wt.%S)in slag]/[(wt.%S) in steel] is 50. 1000kg of liquid steel containing 0.03 wt.% S needs to be desulphurized using a slag to bring the sulphur content down to 0.015 wt.%. The quantity(in kg) of slag needed is?(round off to the nearest integer). ","

The given information is:

Thermodynamic equilibrium: The system is in thermodynamic equilibrium.
No sulphur in the slag prior to desulphurization treatment: The initial sulphur content in the slag is zero.
Equilibrium sulphur partition ratio: The equilibrium sulphur partition ratio between slag and steel is 50.
Initial steel weight: 1000 kg.
Initial sulphur content in steel: 0.03 wt.%.
Desired sulphur content in steel after desulphurization: 0.015 wt.%.

To calculate the quantity of slag needed for desulphurization, we can use the equilibrium sulphur partition ratio and the mass balance equation.

Let's assume the weight of the slag needed for desulphurization is x kg.

The mass balance equation for sulphur can be written as:

(Initial sulphur content in steel) * (Initial steel weight) = (Desired sulphur content in steel) * (Final steel weight) + (Sulphur content in slag) * (Slag weight)

Substituting the given values, we get:

(0.03 wt.%) * (1000 kg) = (0.015 wt.%) * (1000 kg + x kg) + (Sulphur content in slag) * (x kg)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 kg = 15 kg + (Sulphur content in slag) * (x kg)

Since the equilibrium sulphur partition ratio is 50, we can write:

(Sulphur content in slag) = (Sulphur content in steel) / 50

Substituting this in the previous equation, we get:

30 kg = 15 kg + (0.015 wt.%) * (x kg) / 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 1000 kg

Therefore, the quantity of slag needed for desulphurization is 1000 kg.

Answer: 1000 kg

Material manufacturing,87,G-META-21-41,NUM,44,"Liquid iron is cast into a spherical sand mold (6cm radius) and a cubical sand mold (12cm edge length). If solidification time is 60 minutes in the spherical casting, the time(in minutes) required to solidify in the cubical casting is?(round off to nearest integer)","

The solidification time for the cubical casting can be calculated using the Chvorinov's rule, which states that the solidification time is proportional to the square of the volume-to-surface area ratio of the casting.

For the spherical casting, the volume-to-surface area ratio is:

V/A = (4/3) * pi * r^3 / (4 * pi * r^2) = r/3 = 6/3 = 2 cm

For the cubical casting, the volume-to-surface area ratio is:

V/A = a^3 / (6 * a^2) = a/6 = 12/6 = 2 cm

Since the volume-to-surface area ratio is the same for both castings, the solidification time will also be the same. Therefore, the time required to solidify in the cubical casting is also 60 minutes.

Answer: 60 minutes

the deformation. The nominal strain diﬀers ( ε1+ε2̸=ε12) while the true strain is
identical ( ϕ1+ϕ2=ϕ12) for both deformation sequences
The diﬀerence between true and nominal strain can be explained using the
example of two identical specimens, deformed in diﬀerent steps as shown in
ﬁgure 3.1.
The ﬁrst specimen is lengthened from its initial length l0to a length l1=
1.5l0(i. e., ∆l= 0.5l0), corresponding to a nominal strain of
ε1=∆l
l0=0.5l0
l0= 0.5
and a true strain of
ϕ1= ln1.5l0
l0= 0.405.
During further deformation, it is lengthened again by ∆l= 0.5l0to a total
length of l2= 2l0. This deformation is described by the following strains:
ε2=∆l
1.5l0=0.5l0
1.5l0= 0.333,

If the sulfur content in the steel is reduced from 0.015 mass% to 0.0025 mass%, the desulfurizing index is? (round off to the nearest integer).","

The desulfurizing index is a measure of the effectiveness of a desulfurization process in removing sulfur from a material, such as molten steel. It is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the amount of sulfur removed from the material relative to the initial sulfur content.

To calculate the desulfurizing index for the given scenario, we need to know the initial sulfur content in the molten steel and the final sulfur content after the desulfurization process.

Let's assume that the initial sulfur content in the molten steel is 0.015 mass% and the final sulfur content after the desulfurization process is 0.0025 mass%.

The desulfurizing index can be calculated as follows:

Desulfurizing Index = (Initial Sulfur Content - Final Sulfur Content) / Initial Sulfur Content * 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Desulfurizing Index = (0.015 - 0.0025) / 0.015 * 100

Desulfurizing Index = 83.33%

Therefore, the desulfurizing index for the given scenario is approximately 83.33%.

The correct answer is (B) 0.30.

Explanation:

To determine the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, we need to calculate the number of moles of each monomer in the copolymer.

Let's assume that the copolymer has a molecular weight of 10520 g/mol and a degree of polymerization of 160.

The molecular weight of vinyl chloride is 62.5 g/mol, and the molecular weight of vinyl acetate is 86.09 g/mol.

The number of moles of vinyl chloride in the copolymer is:

n(vinyl chloride) = (10520 g/mol) / (62.5 g/mol) = 168 moles

The number of moles of vinyl acetate in the copolymer is:

n(vinyl acetate) = (10520 g/mol) / (86.09 g/mol) = 122 moles

The total number of moles in the copolymer is:

n(total) = n(vinyl chloride) + n(vinyl acetate) = 168 + 122 = 290 moles

The mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer is:

x(vinyl chloride) = n(vinyl chloride) / n(total) = 168 / 290 = 0.58

Therefore, the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer is 0.58.

The correct answer is (B) 0.30.

The correct answer is (B) longitudinal.

Explanation:

In carbon fiber reinforced resin composites, the orientation of the fibers plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical properties of the composite material. When the fibers are aligned in the direction of the applied load, the composite exhibits its maximum Young's modulus. This is because the fibers are able to carry the majority of the load, resulting in a higher stiffness and resistance to deformation.

Therefore, for a given fiber volume content, the longitudinal orientation of the fibers will give the maximum value of Young's modulus in carbon fiber reinforced resin composites.

The correct answer is (C) of the presence of chlorine atom in the structure.

Explanation:

Neoprene is a synthetic rubber that is known for its resistance to heat, oil, and chemicals. It is made by polymerizing chloroprene, which is a type of synthetic rubber. The presence of chlorine atoms in the structure of neoprene makes it non-inflammable.

The chlorine atoms in the structure of neoprene act as a flame retardant, which means that they help to prevent the material from catching fire. This is because the chlorine atoms help to break down the chemical bonds in the material, which prevents the material from burning.

The highly cross-linked structure of neoprene also helps to make it non-inflammable. The cross-links in the structure of neoprene help to make the material more stable and less likely to burn.

The linear chain structure of neoprene does not have a significant impact on its inflammability.

The absence of chlorine atoms in the structure of neoprene would make it more likely to burn.

Here are some additional details about the inflammability of neoprene:

Neoprene is a synthetic rubber that is made by polymerizing chloroprene.

Chloroprene is a type of synthetic rubber that is made by reacting chlorine with butadiene.

The chlorine atoms in the structure of neoprene act as a flame retardant, which means that they help to prevent the material from catching fire.

The cross-links in the structure of neoprene help to make the material more stable and less likely to burn.

The linear chain structure of neoprene does not have a significant impact on its inflammability.

The absence of chlorine atoms in the structure of neoprene would make it more likely to burn.

If the theoretical density of SiC is 3.22 g $cm^(-3)$ and that of $Al_2O_3$ is 3.95 g $cm^(-3)$, estimate the porosity (%) of the composite, assuming that the linear rule of mixtures is valid in this case.","

The given information is:

- Volume fraction of SiC whiskers: 30%
- Bulk density of the composite: 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$
- Theoretical density of SiC: 3.22 g $cm^(-3)$
- Theoretical density of $Al_2O_3$: 3.95 g $cm^(-3)$

The linear rule of mixtures states that the density of a composite material is the weighted average of the densities of its constituents. In this case, the density of the composite can be calculated as:

$$\rho_{composite} = V_{SiC} \times \rho_{SiC} + V_{Al_2O_3} \times \rho_{Al_2O_3}$$

where $V_{SiC}$ and $V_{Al_2O_3}$ are the volume fractions of SiC and $Al_2O_3$, respectively, and $\rho_{SiC}$ and $\rho_{Al_2O_3}$ are the densities of SiC and $Al_2O_3$, respectively.

Since the volume fraction of SiC is 30%, the volume fraction of $Al_2O_3$ is 70%. Therefore, the density of the composite can be calculated as:

$$\rho_{composite} = 0.3 \times 3.22 + 0.7 \times 3.95 = 3.72 \text{ g } cm^(-3)$$

The porosity of the composite can be calculated as the difference between the theoretical density and the measured bulk density, divided by the theoretical density:

$$\text{Porosity} = \frac{\rho_{theoretical} - \rho_{bulk}}{\rho_{theoretical}} \times 100\%$$

In this case, the theoretical density of the composite is 3.72 g $cm^(-3)$, and the measured bulk density is 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$. Therefore, the porosity of the composite is:

$$\text{Porosity} = \frac{3.72 - 3.65}{3.72} \times 100\% = 1.9\%$$

So, the porosity of the composite is approximately 1.9%.

Material Applications,17,G-XEC-2017-2,MCQS,22,Which processing technique is best suited for manufacturing decorative PVC floor tiles?  (A) Blow molding (B) Filament winding(C) Rotational molding (D) Calendering,"

The correct answer is (D) Calendering.

Explanation:

Calendering is a manufacturing process that involves passing a material, such as PVC, through a series of rollers to create a thin, flat sheet. This process is commonly used to produce decorative PVC floor tiles, as it allows for precise control over the thickness and surface texture of the material.

Blow molding is a process used to create hollow plastic parts, such as bottles and containers, by inflating a heated plastic tube into a mold. This process is not suitable for manufacturing decorative PVC floor tiles.

Filament winding is a process used to create composite materials by winding fibers around a mandrel. This process is not suitable for manufacturing decorative PVC floor tiles.

Rotational molding is a process used to create hollow plastic parts by heating a mold filled with plastic powder and rotating it to distribute the material evenly. This process is not suitable for manufacturing decorative PVC floor tiles.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Calendering.

The correct answer is (A) Evolution of hydrogen.

Explanation:

When a zinc metal rod is immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid, a chemical reaction occurs between the zinc and the acid. The reaction produces hydrogen gas, which is released as bubbles. The chemical equation for this reaction is:

Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)

In this reaction, the zinc metal (Zn) reacts with the hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and hydrogen gas (H2). The hydrogen gas is released as bubbles, which is the evolution of hydrogen.

17.2 CEMENTATION
Cementation is the reduction of an ion in solution using a metal that has a more negative electrode potential. As is well-known, when a piece of iron is dipped into a copper sulfate solution the iron becomes plated with a deposit of copper metal. The process is electrochemical in nature (see Figure 17.1): Cathode reductio nreaction: Cu (aq) 2e Cu(s); V2+() . += =−E00337 Anode oxidatio nreaction: Fe(s)F ea qe V2+() ;.

17.3 CORROSION
Corrosion is an electrochemical process and can occur in a number of ways. Galvanic corrosion can occur when two different metals in contact are immersed in a common electrolyte. The more active metal (the anode) corrodes at a faster rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate compared with their rates of corrosion if separated. For this reason, zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures (for example, galvanised steel). Concentration cell corrosion can occur when

(A) Component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from Y (B) Component made from alloy Y can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from X (C) Both can tolerate same flaw size (D) None of the above","

The correct answer is (A).

Explanation:

The fracture toughness, $K_(IC)$, is a measure of a material's resistance to crack propagation under Mode I loading. A higher $K_(IC)$ value indicates that the material can withstand a higher stress intensity factor before fracture occurs.

In this case, since alloy X has a higher $K_(IC)$ value than alloy Y, it means that alloy X can tolerate a higher stress intensity factor before fracture. Therefore, if the components are subjected to the same stress during operation, the component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to the component made from alloy Y.

The flaw size is directly related to the stress intensity factor. A larger flaw size leads to a higher stress intensity factor, and a higher stress intensity factor increases the likelihood of fracture. Since alloy X has a higher $K_(IC)$ value, it can withstand a higher stress intensity factor, which means it can tolerate a larger flaw size.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A). The component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to the component made from alloy Y.

The mesh number of a sieve is the number of openings per inch. To find the mesh number, we need to convert the aperture size from µm to inches.

1 inch = 25.4 mm = 25400 µm

Mesh number = (1 inch / aperture size in µm) * 1000

Mesh number = (25400 / 74) * 1000

Mesh number = 343.24

If the overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B and the composition of β is 90 mol% B, the composition(in mol% B) of α is ? (round off to the nearest integer). ","

The equilibrium microstructure of an alloy A-B consists of two phases α and β in the molar proportion 2:1. If the overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B and the composition of β is 90 mol% B, the composition(in mol% B) of α is ? (round off to the nearest integer).

Answer:

To determine the composition of phase α, we can use the lever rule, which states that the molar proportion of the two phases is inversely proportional to the distance between their compositions on the phase diagram.

Let's denote the composition of phase α as xα and the composition of phase β as xβ. We know that xβ = 90 mol% B.

Using the lever rule, we can write:

2 / (1 + 2) = (xβ - 70) / (xβ - xα)

Solving for xα, we get:

xα = 2xβ - 3xβ + 140

Substituting xβ = 90, we get:

xα = 2(90) - 3(90) + 140

xα = 180 - 270 + 140

xα = 50 mol% B

Therefore, the composition of phase α is 50 mol% B.

Phase transition,0,G-XEC-2012-17,MCQS-NUM,71,"A plain 0.45 wt.% carbon steel is cooled slowly from 900°C to just below the eutectoid temperature (723°C) so that the following reaction occurs: γ (0.8 wt.% C) ↔ α (0.02 wt.% C) + $Fe_3C$ (6.67 wt.% C). During cooling from 900°C to 723°C, the proeutectoid α forms from γ. Find the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel.   (A) 44.9% (B) 66.1% (C) 55.1% (D) 34.9% ","

The correct answer is (C) 55.1%.

Explanation:

The volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel can be calculated using the lever rule. The lever rule states that the volume % of a phase is proportional to the distance between the composition of the phase and the overall composition of the alloy.

In this case, the overall composition of the alloy is 0.45 wt.% C, and the composition of the proeutectoid α is 0.02 wt.% C. The distance between these two compositions is 0.43 wt.% C.

The distance between the composition of the proeutectoid α and the composition of the eutectoid γ is 0.78 wt.% C.

Therefore, the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel is:

Volume % of proeutectoid α = (0.43 / 0.78) x 100% = 55.1%

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the calculation:

1. Determine the overall composition of the alloy. In this case, the overall composition of the alloy is 0.45 wt.% C.

2. Determine the composition of the proeutectoid α. In this case, the composition of the proeutectoid α is 0.02 wt.% C.

3. Determine the distance between the composition of the proeutectoid α and the overall composition of the alloy. In this case, the distance is 0.43 wt.% C.

4. Determine the distance between the composition of the proeutectoid α and the composition of the eutectoid γ. In this case, the distance is 0.78 wt.% C.

5. Calculate the volume % of proeutectoid α using the lever rule. In this case, the volume % of proeutectoid α is (0.43 / 0.78) x 100% = 55.1%.

Here is a table that summarizes the calculation:

| Phase | Composition (wt.% C) | Distance from overall composition (wt.% C) | Volume % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proeutectoid α | 0.02 | 0.43 | 55.1% |
| Eutectoid γ | 0.8 | 0.78 | 44.9% |

Explanation:

An isomorphous phase diagram is a type of binary alloy system in which the two end components have similar crystal structures and can form a continuous series of solid solutions. The following rules need to be satisfied for obtaining an isomorphous phase diagram:

1. The atomic size difference between the end components should be less than 15%. This is because a large size difference can lead to lattice distortion and strain, which can affect the stability of the solid solution.

2. Both the end components should have the same crystal structure. This is because a difference in crystal structure can lead to the formation of intermetallic compounds or other phases, which can disrupt the continuity of the solid solution.

3. The valency of the end components should be the same. This is because a difference in valency can lead to the formation of ionic or covalent bonds, which can affect the stability of the solid solution.

4. The end components should have similar electronegativities. This is because a large difference in electronegativity can lead to the formation of intermetallic compounds or other phases, which can disrupt the continuity of the solid solution.

Explanation:

The backscattered electron (BSE) signal in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) is sensitive to the atomic number (Z) of the elements in the sample. The higher the atomic number, the more electrons are backscattered.

In this case, the α-phase contains ~97 wt% Pb, which has an atomic number of 82, while the β-phase contains ~99 wt% Sn, which has an atomic number of 50. Since Pb has a higher atomic number than Sn, the α-phase will backscatter more electrons than the β-phase.

The correct answer is (C) Gibbs energy of the system should be minimum and $(𝜇_𝐴)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_A)^𝛽$ , $(𝜇_B)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_B)^𝛽$

Explanation:

In a two-component system at constant temperature and pressure, the condition for the α and β phases to be in equilibrium is that the Gibbs energy of the system should be minimum. This is because the Gibbs energy is a thermodynamic potential that describes the energy of a system at constant temperature and pressure.

The chemical potential of a component in a phase is defined as the partial derivative of the Gibbs energy with respect to the number of moles of that component, holding the temperature, pressure, and number of moles of other components constant. Therefore, the condition for the α and β phases to be in equilibrium is that the chemical potential of each component in the α phase should be equal to the chemical potential of the same component in the β phase.

In other words, the condition for the α and β phases to be in equilibrium is that the chemical potential of component A in the α phase should be equal to the chemical potential of component A in the β phase, and the chemical potential of component B in the α phase should be equal to the chemical potential of component B in the β phase.

The correct answer is (A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases.

Explanation:

During a diffusional transformation, the rate of transformation is influenced by both the thermodynamic driving force and the mobility of atoms in the α matrix. The thermodynamic driving force increases with increasing undercooling, while the mobility of atoms decreases due to the reduced temperature.

Initially, the rate of transformation increases with increasing undercooling because the increased driving force outweighs the decreased mobility.

- Molar volume of α phase: 7.377 $cm^3$
- Molar volume of β phase: 7.317 $cm^3$
- Transformation temperature: 773 K
- Transformation pressure: 1 atm
- Transformation temperature at 723 K: 723 K

To calculate the pressure required for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

$$\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{\Delta H}{T \Delta V}$$

where:

- $dP$ is the change in pressure
- $dT$ is the change in temperature
- $\Delta H$ is the enthalpy of transformation
- $T$ is the temperature
- $\Delta V$ is the change in molar volume

We can rearrange the equation to solve for $dP$:

$$dP = \frac{\Delta H}{T \Delta V} dT$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$dP = \frac{912 \text{ J/mol}}{(773 \text{ K})(7.317 \text{ cm}^3/\text{mol} - 7.377 \text{ cm}^3/\text{mol})} (723 \text{ K} - 773 \text{ K})$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$dP = -1.01325 \times 10^5 \text{ Pa}$$

Converting the pressure to atmospheres, we get:

$$dP = -1.01325 \text{ atm}$$

Therefore, the pressure required for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is -1.01325 atm.

The negative sign indicates that the pressure must be decreased to achieve the transformation at the lower temperature.

During heating, Ti undergoes allotropic transformation from hcp to bcc at 882 °C. The percent volume change accompanying this transformation is (round off to 1 decimal place) ","

The atomic weight of titanium (Ti) is 47.9 g/mol.

The lattice parameter of body-centered cubic (bcc) Ti is 0.332 nm.

The density of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Ti is 4.51 g/cm^3.

Avogadro's number is 6.023 x 10^23.

During heating, Ti undergoes allotropic transformation from hcp to bcc at 882 °C.

The percent volume change accompanying this transformation is (round off to 1 decimal place)

To calculate the percent volume change, we need to know the volume of the hcp and bcc structures.

The volume of the hcp structure can be calculated using the following formula:

V_hcp = (a^2 * c * sqrt(3) / 2) * N_A

Where:

a is the lattice parameter of the hcp structure (0.332 nm)

c is the lattice parameter of the hcp structure (0.521 nm)

N_A is Avogadro's number (6.023 x 10^23)

The volume of the bcc structure can be calculated using the following formula:

V_bcc = (a^3 / 2) * N_A

Where:

a is the lattice parameter of the bcc structure (0.332 nm)

N_A is Avogadro's number (6.023 x 10^23)

The percent volume change can then be calculated using the following formula:

% Volume Change = (V_bcc - V_hcp) / V_hcp * 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

V_hcp = (0.332^2 * 0.521 * sqrt(3) / 2) * 6.023 x 10^23 = 1.09 x 10^23 nm^3

V_bcc = (0.332^3 / 2) * 6.023 x 10^23 = 1.09 x 10^23 nm^3

% Volume Change = (1.09 x 10^23 - 1.09 x 10^23) / 1.09 x 10^23 * 100 = 0%

Therefore, the percent volume change accompanying the allotropic transformation from hcp to bcc in Ti is 0%.

1. Martensite: The quenched end of the specimen cools rapidly, resulting in the formation of martensite, a hard and brittle microstructure.
2. Martensite and Pearlite: As the distance from the quenched end increases, the cooling rate decreases, leading to the formation of a mixture of martensite and pearlite.
3. Fine Pearlite: Further away from the quenched end, the cooling rate is slower, allowing for the formation of fine pearlite, a softer and more ductile microstructure.

The correct answer is: (C) M′O

Explanation:

In the Ellingham diagram for oxides, the C-CO line represents the standard free energy change for the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon monoxide. The M-MO and M′-M′O lines represent the standard free energy changes for the reactions of metals M and M′ with oxygen to form their respective oxides MO and M′O.

The intersection of the C-CO line with the M-MO line at temperature $T_1$ indicates that at this temperature, the standard free energy change for the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon monoxide is equal to the standard free energy change for the reaction of metal M with oxygen to form its oxide MO. This means that at temperature $T_1$, carbon can reduce MO to M.

Similarly, the intersection of the C-CO line with the M′-M′O line at a higher temperature $T_2$ indicates that at this temperature, the standard free energy change for the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon monoxide is equal to the standard free energy change for the reaction of metal M′ with oxygen to form its oxide M′O. This means that at temperature $T_2$, carbon can reduce M′O to M′.

where a_FCC is the lattice parameter of the FCC phase.

The volume change in % is:

%_change = (V_FCC - V_BCC) / V_BCC * 100

Substituting the values for a_BCC and a_FCC, we get:

%_change = (0.363^3 - 0.293^3) / 0.293^3 * 100

%_change = 36.7%

If liquid copper is cooled to 1353 K, magnitude of the driving force($J.mol^(-1)$) for liquid to transform to solid is?(round off to one decimal places)","

The driving force for the liquid to transform to solid is the difference in chemical potential between the liquid and solid phases. The chemical potential of a phase is given by:

$$\mu = \mu^0 + RT \ln a$$

where $\mu^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $a$ is the activity of the phase.

For a pure substance, the activity is equal to the mole fraction, which is 1 for both the liquid and solid phases. Therefore, the chemical potential of the liquid and solid phases is:

$$\mu_{liquid} = \mu^0_{liquid} + RT \ln 1 = \mu^0_{liquid}$$

$$\mu_{solid} = \mu^0_{solid} + RT \ln 1 = \mu^0_{solid}$$

The difference in chemical potential between the liquid and solid phases is:

$$\Delta \mu = \mu_{liquid} - \mu_{solid} = \mu^0_{liquid} - \mu^0_{solid}$$

The standard chemical potential of a phase is related to the Gibbs free energy of the phase by:

$$\mu^0 = G^0 / n$$

where $G^0$ is the standard Gibbs free energy and $n$ is the number of moles.

The standard Gibbs free energy of a phase is related to the enthalpy and entropy of the phase by:

$$G^0 = H^0 - TS^0$$

where $H^0$ is the standard enthalpy and $S^0$ is the standard entropy.

The standard enthalpy of a phase is equal to the enthalpy of formation of the phase, which is 0 for a pure substance. Therefore, the standard Gibbs free energy of the liquid and solid phases is:

$$G^0_{liquid} = - TS^0_{liquid}$$

$$G^0_{solid} = - TS^0_{solid}$$

The difference in standard Gibbs free energy between the liquid and solid phases is:

$$\Delta G^0 = G^0_{liquid} - G^0_{solid} = - T(S^0_{liquid} - S^0_{solid})$$

The difference in entropy between the liquid and solid phases is:

$$\Delta S^0 = S^0_{liquid} - S^0_{solid} = \frac{\Delta H_{fusion}}{T_{fusion}}$$

where $\Delta H_{fusion}$ is the enthalpy of fusion and $T_{fusion}$ is the melting temperature.

Therefore, the difference in standard Gibbs free energy between the liquid and solid phases is:

$$\Delta G^0 = - T \frac{\Delta H_{fusion}}{T_{fusion}}$$

The driving force for the liquid to transform to solid is the difference in chemical potential between the liquid and solid phases, which is:

$$\Delta \mu = \mu^0_{liquid} - \mu^0_{solid} = \frac{\Delta G^0}{n} = - \frac{T \Delta H_{fusion}}{n T_{fusion}}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\Delta \mu = - \frac{(1353 K) (13000 J/mol)}{(1 mol) (1356 K)} = -12999 J/mol$$

Therefore, the magnitude of the driving force for liquid to transform to solid is 12999 J/mol.

The free energy change for the liquid to solid transformation at 1058K can be calculated using the following equation:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔG is the free energy change, ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change.

We are given that the melting point of Cu is 1358K and its enthalpy of melting is 13400 J $mol^(-1)$. We can use this information to calculate the entropy change for the liquid to solid transformation at 1358K:

ΔS = ΔH / T

ΔS = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$ / 1358K

ΔS = 9.87 J $mol^(-1)$ K^(-1)

Now we can use this value of ΔS to calculate the free energy change for the liquid to solid transformation at 1058K:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

ΔG = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$ - (1058K)(9.87 J $mol^(-1)$ K^(-1))

ΔG = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$ - 10450 J $mol^(-1)$

ΔG = 2900 J $mol^(-1)$

Therefore, the free energy change for the liquid to solid transformation at 1058K is 2900 J $mol^(-1)$.

The correct answer is: (B) 1.60 * $10^(–1)$ S/m

Explanation:

The conductivity of a semiconductor is given by the formula:

σ = n * e * μ

where:

σ is the conductivity in S/m
n is the electron concentration in m^-3
e is the charge of an electron in C
μ is the mobility of the electrons in m^2/V*s

The mobility of the electrons can be calculated using the formula:

μ = v / E

where:

v is the drift velocity in m/s
E is the electric field in V/m

In this case, we have:

n = 5 * $10^18$/m^3
v = 100 m/s
E = 500 V/m

Therefore, the mobility of the electrons is:

μ = 100 m/s / 500 V/m = 0.2 m^2/V*s

The conductivity of the semiconductor is:

σ = 5 * $10^18$/m^3 * 1.6 * $10^(–19)$ C * 0.2 m^2/V*s = 1.60 * $10^(–1)$ S/m

Electrical,1,G-XEC-2015-57-14,NUM,37,"A 1 kg sacrificial anode of Mg (atomic weight: 24.31 amu) is attached to the base of a ship. If the anode lasts for 60 days, what is the average corrosion current (in Amperes) during that period?","

The given information is:

- Mass of the sacrificial anode: 1 kg
- Atomic weight of Mg: 24.31 amu
- Duration of the anode's life: 60 days

To calculate the average corrosion current, we need to use Faraday's law of electrolysis. The formula for Faraday's law is:

I = (m * n * F) / (t * M)

where:

- I is the average corrosion current (in Amperes)
- m is the mass of the anode (in grams)
- n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule of the anode material (in this case, Mg)
- F is Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)
- t is the time (in seconds)
- M is the molar mass of the anode material (in grams/mol)

To calculate the number of electrons transferred per molecule of Mg, we need to look at the chemical reaction that occurs during the corrosion process. The reaction for the corrosion of Mg is:

Mg -> Mg2+ + 2e-

This means that two electrons are transferred per molecule of Mg.

To calculate the molar mass of Mg, we need to convert the atomic weight from amu to grams/mol. The conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.660539040 x 10-24 grams. Therefore, the molar mass of Mg is:

M = 24.31 amu * (1.660539040 x 10-24 grams/amu) = 4.038 x 10-23 grams/mol

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:

I = (1000 grams * 2 * 96,485 C/mol) / (60 days * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour * 4.038 x 10-23 grams/mol)

I = 1.04 x 10-14 Amperes

Therefore, the average corrosion current during the 60-day period is 1.04 x 10-14 Amperes.

Hall effect measurement shows electron mobility to be 3.2 * $10^(-3)m^(2)V^(-1)s^(-1)$. Electrical resistivity of copper is 1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm. The average number of free electrons per atom in copper is ?,"

The average number of free electrons per atom in copper can be calculated using the given information.

First, we need to calculate the number of atoms per unit volume of copper. Since copper is an FCC metal, the number of atoms per unit cell is 4. The volume of the unit cell is given by:

V = a^3

where a is the lattice parameter.

Therefore, the number of atoms per unit volume is:

n = 4 / V

Next, we can calculate the number of free electrons per unit volume using the electron mobility and electrical resistivity. The electron mobility is given by:

μ = eτ / m

where e is the charge of an electron, τ is the mean free time between collisions, and m is the mass of an electron.

The electrical resistivity is given by:

ρ = m / (ne^2τ)

where n is the number of free electrons per unit volume.

Solving for n, we get:

n = 1 / (ρeμ)

Now, we can calculate the average number of free electrons per atom by dividing the number of free electrons per unit volume by the number of atoms per unit volume:

N = n / n

Substituting the given values, we get:

N = (1 / (1.7*10^(-8) * 1.6*10^(-19) * 3.2*10^(-3))) / (4 / (3.62*10^(-10))^3)

N = 0.99

Therefore, the average number of free electrons per atom in copper is approximately 1.

The correct answer is (C) 24.

Explanation:

The given anodic reaction is:

𝑀𝑔 ⟶ $𝑀𝑔^(+2)$ + $2𝑒^(-)$

This reaction involves the oxidation of Mg to $𝑀𝑔^(+2)$ and the release of 2 electrons.

The amount of Mg dissolved into the solution can be calculated using Faraday's laws of electrolysis.

According to Faraday's laws, the amount of substance (in moles) that is produced or consumed during an electrochemical reaction is directly proportional to the amount of charge (in Coulombs) that is passed through the reaction.

The proportionality constant is the Faraday constant, which is equal to 96500 C/mole of electrons.

In this case, the amount of charge passed through the reaction is 48250 Coulombs.

Therefore, the amount of Mg dissolved into the solution can be calculated as follows:

Amount of Mg (in moles) = (48250 Coulombs) / (96500 C/mole of electrons) = 0.5 moles

To convert the amount of Mg from moles to grams, we can use the atomic weight of Mg, which is 24 g/mole.

Amount of Mg (in grams) = (0.5 moles) x (24 g/mole) = 12 g

Therefore, the amount of Mg dissolved into the solution is 12 g.

The correct answer is (C) 24.

The correct answer is (C) electronic polarizability.

Here's the explanation:

At ultraviolet frequencies, the dielectric constant of a material is mainly due to electronic polarizability. This is because the frequency of ultraviolet light is high enough to cause the electrons in the material to oscillate, which leads to electronic polarization.

Ionic polarizability is not significant at ultraviolet frequencies because the ions in the material are too heavy to oscillate at such high frequencies. Dipolar polarizability is also not significant at ultraviolet frequencies because the dipoles in the material are not able to align with the rapidly changing electric field. Interfacial polarizability is not significant at ultraviolet frequencies because the interfaces between different materials in the material are not able to respond to the rapidly changing electric field.

C is the capacitance in farads (F)
ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.854 x 10^-12 F/m)
εr is the relative permittivity or dielectric constant of the material (2000 for $BaTiO_3$)
A is the area of the electrodes in square meters (0.2 x 10^-4 m^2)

(A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure (B) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure (C) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure (D) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and pressure,"

The correct answer is (A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure.

Explanation:

In an intrinsic semiconductor, the electrical conductivity is primarily determined by the number of charge carriers (electrons and holes) available for conduction. As the temperature increases, more electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band, leading to an increase in the number of charge carriers and, consequently, an increase in electrical conductivity.

Similarly, when the pressure is increased, the band gap between the valence band and the conduction band decreases, making it easier for electrons to be excited to the conduction band. This also results in an increase in the number of charge carriers and, therefore, an increase in electrical conductivity.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure.

The hydrogen electrode is a standard used to measure redox potentials. It is a reference electrode that is used to measure the potential of other electrodes. The hydrogen electrode is a half-cell that consists of a platinum electrode immersed in a solution of hydrogen ions. The potential of the hydrogen electrode is defined as zero volts.

The hydrogen electrode is used to measure the potential of other electrodes because it is a stable and reproducible reference. The potential of the hydrogen electrode is not affected by the concentration of the hydrogen ions in the solution.

The correct answer is (A) Sn undergoes oxidation.

Explanation:

The given electrochemical reaction is:

Sn + $2H^(+)$ = $Sn^(2+)$ + $H_2$

In this reaction, Sn is the reactant and $Sn^(2+)$ is the product. The standard reduction potential for $Sn^(2+)$ + $2*e^(-1)$ → Sn is -0.136 V versus SHE. This means that Sn is more likely to undergo oxidation than reduction.

The solution has $Sn^(2+)$ concentration $10^(-2)$M and pH 5 at 298 K. The pH of the solution is 5, which means that the concentration of $H^(+)$ is $10^(-5)$M.

Since the concentration of $H^(+)$ is much lower than the concentration of $Sn^(2+)$, the reaction is more likely to proceed in the direction of oxidation of Sn.

- Electron mobility: $mu_e = 0.75 m^2V^(-1)s^(-1)$
- Hole mobility: $mu_h = 0.06 m^2V^(-1)s^(-1)$

To find the intrinsic carrier concentration, we can use the formula for electrical conductivity:

where:

- $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration (per $m^3$)
- $e$ is the elementary charge ($1.602 \times 10^(-19) C$)

σ is the electrical conductivity in (Ω.m)^(-1)
n is the charge carrier concentration in m^(-3)
q is the charge of an electron in C
μ is the mobility of the charge carriers in m^2.V^(-1).s^(-1)

The correct answer is (A) 1.36 mV.

Explanation:

The voltage required to electrolytically refine impure copper to pure copper can be calculated using the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (RT/nF) ln(a)

where:

E is the voltage required
E° is the standard electrode potential
R is the gas constant
T is the temperature in Kelvin
n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction
F is Faraday's constant
a is the activity of the impure copper

For the electrolytic refining of copper, the reaction is:

Therefore, n = 2.

The standard electrode potential for the reaction is 0.34 V.

Substituting the given values into the Nernst equation, we get:

E = 0.34 - (8.314 * 300 / (2 * 96500)) ln(0.9)

E = 0.34 - 0.00136

E = 0.33864 V

Converting this to millivolts, we get:

E = 0.33864 * 1000

The limiting current density is the maximum current density that can be achieved during an electrochemical process, such as electrodeposition. It is determined by the rate of mass transfer of the reactant to the electrode surface.

In this case, the reactant is $CuSO_4$, and the mass transfer coefficient is given as $10^(−4)𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$. The concentration of $CuSO_4$ in the solution is $0.5 * 10^(−3) 𝑚𝑜𝑙.$𝑐𝑚^(−3)$.

To calculate the limiting current density, we can use the following equation:

$𝐼_{𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡}=𝑛𝐹𝐴𝑘_𝑚𝑡𝐶$

where:

$𝐼_{𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡}$ is the limiting current density (in 𝑚𝐴. $𝑐𝑚^(−2)$)

$𝑛$ is the number of electrons transferred per molecule of reactant (in this case, $CuSO_4$)

$𝐹$ is the Faraday constant (96500 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑏 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡)

$𝑘_𝑚𝑡$ is the mass transfer coefficient (in $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$)

$𝐶$ is the concentration of the reactant (in 𝑚𝑜𝑙.$𝑐𝑚^(−3)$)

In this case, $𝑛 = 2$ (since $CuSO_4$ is reduced to $Cu$ and $SO_4^(2−)$), and $𝐴$ is not given, so we cannot calculate the limiting current density.

Atomic weight of copper = 63
100 metric tons of copper concentrate containing 21 wt.% Cu
Processing time = 6 months with 25 working days per month and 8 working hours per day
10 cells arranged in series

To calculate the minimum current rating (Ampere per month per cell), we need to determine the amount of copper that needs to be deposited and the time required for the process.

Amount of copper to be deposited:

100 metric tons of copper concentrate = 100,000 kg
21 wt.% Cu in the concentrate = 21,000 kg of Cu

Electrolysis of copper:

The electrolysis of copper involves the following half-reaction at the cathode:

Cu2+ + 2e- → Cu

According to Faraday's laws of electrolysis, the amount of substance deposited or dissolved is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell.

The quantity of electricity (Q) is given by:

Q = I × t

where:

I is the current (in amperes)
t is the time (in seconds)

The amount of copper to be deposited (m) is given by:

m = (Q / F) × M

where:

F is the Faraday constant (96500 Coulomb per gram equivalent)
M is the molar mass of copper (63 g/mol)

Substituting the values, we get:

m = (Q / 96500) × 63

To calculate the minimum current rating, we need to determine the minimum time required for the process.

Time required for the process:

Processing time = 6 months with 25 working days per month and 8 working hours per day

Total working hours = 6 months × 25 days/month × 8 hours/day = 1200 hours

Minimum current rating:

The minimum current rating (I) is the minimum current required to deposit the desired amount of copper within the given time.

I = (m × F) / (M × t)

Substituting the values, we get:

I = (21,000 × 96500) / (63 × 1200)

I = 26,800 Ampere per month per cell

Therefore, the minimum current rating (Ampere per month per cell) is 26,800.

The given information is:

Faraday constant (F) = 96490 C $mol^(-1)$

Gas constant (R) = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$

In electrolytic refining of Ni, the anode is Cu-10 atom % Ni and the cathode is pure Ni. Assuming the Cu-Ni solution to be ideal, we need to find the ABSOLUTE value of the minimum voltage (in mV) required for refining.

To calculate the minimum voltage required for refining, we can use the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (RT/nF) ln(Q)

where:

E is the cell potential (in volts)
E° is the standard cell potential (in volts)
R is the gas constant (in J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$)
T is the temperature (in Kelvin)
n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction
F is the Faraday constant (in C $mol^(-1)$)
Q is the reaction quotient

For the given reaction, the standard cell potential (E°) is 0.0007 V at 298 K. We can assume that the standard cell potential remains the same at 300 K.

The reaction quotient (Q) can be calculated as:

Q = (a_Ni^2+) / (a_Cu^2+)

where:

a_Ni^2+ is the activity of Ni^2+ ions in the solution
a_Cu^2+ is the activity of Cu^2+ ions in the solution

Since the Cu-Ni solution is assumed to be ideal, the activities of the ions can be replaced by their concentrations. Therefore, we can write:

Q = ([Ni^2+]) / ([Cu^2+])

where:

[Ni^2+] is the concentration of Ni^2+ ions in the solution
[Cu^2+] is the concentration of Cu^2+ ions in the solution

The concentration of Ni^2+ ions in the solution is 0.10 mol/L, and the concentration of Cu^2+ ions in the solution is 0.90 mol/L.

Substituting the values into the Nernst equation, we get:

E = 0.0007 V - (8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$ * 300 K / (2 * 96490 C $mol^(-1)$)) * ln((0.10 mol/L) / (0.90 mol/L))

E = 0.0007 V - 0.000012 V

E = 0.000688 V

The ABSOLUTE value of the minimum voltage required for refining is 0.000688 V, which is equivalent to 0.688 mV.

Therefore, the ABSOLUTE value of the minimum voltage (in mV) required for refining is 0.688 mV.

E° = E°_(Zn^(+2)/Zn) - E°_(Fe^(+2)/Fe) = -0.76 V - (-0.44 V) = -0.32 V

The reaction quotient (Q) is given by:

Q = [Zn^(+2)] / [Fe^(+2)]

Substituting the given values into the Nernst equation, we get:

-0.5 V = -0.32 V - (8.314 J.mol^(-1).K^(-1) * 298 K / (2 * 96500 C.mol^(-1))) ln ([Zn^(+2)] / [Fe^(+2)])

Solving for the ratio of the concentrations, we get:

[Zn^(+2)] / [Fe^(+2)] = 10^(6)

Therefore, the ratio of the concentration of $[Fe^(+2)]$ to $[Zn^(+2)]$ ions in the cell is of the order of $10^(6)$.

The given information is:

Faraday's constant (F) = 96500 C $mol^(-1)$

Standard reduction potential of Ni^(+2)/Ni ($E°_(Ni^(+2)/Ni)$) = -0.25 V

Temperature (T) = 298 K

To calculate the standard chemical potential of Ni^(+2) ($µ°_(Ni^(+2))$), we can use the Nernst equation:

$E = E° - (RT)/(nF) ln Q$

where:

E is the cell potential
E° is the standard cell potential
R is the gas constant (8.314 J $mol^(-1)$ K^(-1))
T is the temperature (298 K)
n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction
F is Faraday's constant (96500 C $mol^(-1)$)
Q is the reaction quotient

In this case, we are interested in the standard chemical potential of Ni^(+2), which is related to the standard reduction potential of Ni^(+2)/Ni. We can rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for $µ°_(Ni^(+2))$:

$µ°_(Ni^(+2)) = -nFE°_(Ni^(+2)/Ni)$

Substituting the given values:

$µ°_(Ni^(+2)) = -2 \times 96500 \times (-0.25) = 48250 J mol^(-1)$

At 25°C, iron corrodes in a dearated acid of pH 3 with a corrosion current density of 4 µA $cm^(-2)$. The corrosion potential (V) is?(round off to 2 decimal places). ","

The given information is:

- $β_c$ = 0.1 V per decade of current density
- Exchange current density of hydrogen on iron surface = $10^(-9)$ A $cm^(-2)$
- R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$
- F = 96500 C $mol^(-1)$
- At 25°C, iron corrodes in a dearated acid of pH 3 with a corrosion current density of 4 µA $cm^(-2)$

To find the corrosion potential (V) at 25°C, we can use the Nernst equation:

$$E = E^0 - \frac{RT}{nF}ln\frac{[Ox]}{[Red]}$$

where:

- $E$ is the corrosion potential (V)
- $E^0$ is the standard potential (V)
- $R$ is the gas constant (J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$)
- $T$ is the temperature (K)
- $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction
- $F$ is the Faraday constant (C $mol^(-1)$)
- $[Ox]$ is the concentration of the oxidized species
- $[Red]$ is the concentration of the reduced species

In this case, we have:

- $E^0$ = 0 V (standard potential of the standard hydrogen electrode)
- $R$ = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$
- $T$ = 25°C = 298 K
- $n$ = 2 (number of electrons transferred in the reaction)
- $F$ = 96500 C $mol^(-1)$
- $[Ox]$ = 4 µA $cm^(-2)$ (corrosion current density)
- $[Red]$ = 1 (concentration of the reduced species is assumed to be 1)

Substituting these values into the Nernst equation, we get:

$$E = 0 - \frac{8.314 \times 298}{2 \times 96500}ln\frac{4 \times 10^(-6)}{1}$$

$$E = -0.05915 V$$

Therefore, the corrosion potential (V) at 25°C is -0.05915 V.

Slip casting is a ceramic forming process that involves pouring a slurry of ceramic particles and water into a porous mold. The water is absorbed by the mold, leaving behind a solid ceramic part. This process is commonly used to produce ceramic parts.

Zone refining is a process used to purify metals by passing a molten zone through a solid metal rod. The impurities in the metal are concentrated in the molten zone, which is then removed, leaving behind a purified metal. This process is commonly used to produce single crystals of metals.

Sputtering is a process used to deposit thin films of materials onto a substrate. In this process, a target material is bombarded with high-energy ions, which causes atoms from the target to be ejected and deposited onto the substrate. This process is commonly used to produce thin films of metals, ceramics, and other materials.

The answer is (B) Increasing carbon content.

Explanation:

Increasing the carbon content expands the y-loop and in the medium-carbon range Cr contents with good stainless qualities (~15-18%) can be quench-hardened for cutlery purposes where martensite is required to give a hard, sharp cutting edge. The combination of both Cr and Ni (i.e. 18/8) produces the metastable austenitic stainless steel which is used in chemical plant construction, kitchenware and surgical instruments because of its ductility, toughness and cold-working properties.

Therefore, increasing carbon content can avoid weld decay of austenitic stainless steels.

The correct answer is (B) Both [a] and [r] are true and [r] is not the correct reason for [a].

Explanation:

The assertion is true because the elastic modulus of a material is a property that is independent of the microstructure. It is determined by the interatomic forces and is not affected by the grain size or other microstructural features. Therefore, the elastic modulus in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of a pure metal weld is the same as that in the base metal.

The reason is also true because the coarse grained microstructure in the HAZ results in lower hardness. This is because the larger grain size leads to a reduction in the number of grain boundaries, which are the primary source of resistance to dislocation motion. As a result, the material becomes softer and less resistant to deformation.

However, the reason is not the correct reason for the assertion. The elastic modulus is not affected by the hardness of the material, as it is a property that is independent of the microstructure. Therefore, the reason is not the correct reason for the assertion.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Both [a] and [r] are true and [r] is not the correct reason for [a].

The density of the as-pressed aluminium compact is 1755 kg.$m^(-3)$. If the height of the as-pressed compact is 12 mm, the fill height (in mm) required is?","

The given information is:

Apparent density of aluminum powder: 810 kg/m^3

Compaction pressure: 600 MPa

Density of the as-pressed aluminum compact: 1755 kg/m^3

Height of the as-pressed compact: 12 mm

To find the fill height required, we need to calculate the volume of the as-pressed compact and the volume of the aluminum powder.

Volume of the as-pressed compact:

V = πr^2h

where r is the radius of the compact and h is the height of the compact.

Assuming the compact is cylindrical, we can calculate the radius as:

r = √(A/π)

where A is the cross-sectional area of the compact.

A = πr^2

Therefore, r = √(A/π) = √(12/π) = 1.904 mm

Now, we can calculate the volume of the as-pressed compact:

V = πr^2h = π(1.904)^2(12) = 135.7 mm^3

Volume of the aluminum powder:

V = m/ρ

where m is the mass of the aluminum powder and ρ is the apparent density of the aluminum powder.

m = ρV = (810 kg/m^3)(135.7 mm^3) = 0.110 kg

Therefore, the volume of the aluminum powder is 0.110 kg.

Now, we can calculate the fill height required:

Fill height = V/A = 0.110 kg/(π(1.904)^2) = 0.093 mm

Therefore, the fill height required is 0.093 mm.

Answer: 0.093 mm

The correct answer is (B) Electro Slag Welding.

Explanation:

Electro Slag Welding (ESW) is a welding process that is not suitable for joining thin metal sheets. It is typically used for welding thick sections of metal, such as plates or forgings, and is not suitable for thin metal sheets due to the high heat input and the risk of melting through the material.

The other options, Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), Electron Beam Welding (EBW), and Laser Beam Welding (LBW), are all suitable for joining thin metal sheets. GMAW is a versatile welding process that can be used for a wide range of materials and thicknesses, including thin metal sheets. EBW and LBW are both high-energy welding processes that are well-suited for joining thin metal sheets due to their precise control of heat input and the ability to produce high-quality welds with minimal distortion.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Electro Slag Welding.

A continous fillet weld is made using a 3000 W welding machine. At a travel speed of 6 mm $s^(-1)$, the cross-sectional area(in $mm^2$) of the weld is?(round off to nearest integer)","

The given information is:

Unit energy required to melt the metal: 6 J $mm^(-3)$
Heat transfer factor: 0.6
Melting factor: 0.5
Welding machine power: 3000 W
Travel speed: 6 mm $s^(-1)$

To calculate the cross-sectional area of the weld, we need to determine the energy required to melt the metal. The energy required is the product of the unit energy required to melt the metal and the volume of the weld.

The volume of the weld can be calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area and the length of the weld. Since the travel speed is given, we can calculate the length of the weld as the product of the travel speed and the time taken to complete the weld.

Let's assume that the time taken to complete the weld is 1 second.

The volume of the weld can be calculated as:

Volume = Cross-sectional area * Length

Volume = Cross-sectional area * (Travel speed * Time)

Volume = Cross-sectional area * (6 mm $s^(-1)$ * 1 s)

Volume = 6 mm^2 * Cross-sectional area

The energy required to melt the metal can be calculated as:

Energy = Unit energy required to melt the metal * Volume

Energy = 6 J $mm^(-3)$ * 6 mm^2 * Cross-sectional area

Energy = 36 J * Cross-sectional area

The power of the welding machine is given as 3000 W. We can convert this to Joules per second by multiplying by the time taken to complete the weld.

Power = 3000 W * 1 s

Power = 3000 J

The energy required to melt the metal must be equal to the power of the welding machine.

Energy = Power

36 J * Cross-sectional area = 3000 J

Cross-sectional area = 3000 J / 36 J

Cross-sectional area = 83.33 $mm^2$

Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the weld is approximately 83 $mm^2$.

The diffusion coefficient of copper atoms in aluminium is found to be 1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ at T=400K and 5.75 x $10^(-19)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ at T=500K. Find the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$

Answer:

The diffusion coefficient of copper atoms in aluminium is given by the Arrhenius equation:

D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)

where D0 is the pre-exponential factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

To find the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$, we can use the given values of the diffusion coefficient at 400K and 500K to solve for D0 and Q.

At T=400K:

1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ = D0 exp(-Q/(8.314 J/mol K * 400K))

At T=500K:

5.75 x $10^(-19)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ = D0 exp(-Q/(8.314 J/mol K * 500K))

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

D0 = 1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1)$

Q = 1.38 x $10^5$ J/mol

Now, we can use these values to find the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$:

$10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ = 1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ exp(-1.38 x $10^5$ J/mol / (8.314 J/mol K * T))

Solving for T, we get:

T = 623.15 K

Therefore, the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient of copper atoms in aluminium is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ is 623.15 K.

- Diffusion coefficient of copper in aluminium at 500 °C: 6*$10^(-13)m^(2)s^(-1)$
- Time required to achieve a certain concentration of copper at a given depth at 400 °C: 100 hours

To find the time required to achieve the same concentration of copper at the same depth at 500 °C, we can use the following equation:

$$\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \frac{D_2}{D_1}$$

where:

- $t_1$ is the time required at 400 °C (100 hours)
- $t_2$ is the time required at 500 °C (unknown)
- $D_1$ is the diffusion coefficient at 400 °C ($5*10^(-14)m^(2)s^(-1)$)
- $D_2$ is the diffusion coefficient at 500 °C ($6*10^(-13)m^(2)s^(-1)$)

Substituting the values, we get:

$$\frac{100}{t_2} = \frac{6*10^(-13)}{5*10^(-14)}$$

Solving for $t_2$, we get:

$$t_2 = \frac{100 * 5*10^(-14)}{6*10^(-13)} = 8.33 \text{ hours}$$

To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation for diffusion, which relates the diffusion coefficient to the activation energy and temperature:

D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)

where D is the diffusion coefficient, D0 is the pre-exponential factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for Q:

Q = -R * T * ln(D/D0)

We can then substitute in the given values for D and T, and use the gas constant R = 8.314 J/mol*K. We can also assume that D0 is a constant, so we can ignore it for now.

Q = -8.314 * (500 + 273.15) * ln(1.9 * $10^(-13)$ / 5.8*10^(-13))

Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer)","

The standard reduction potential of nickel is -0.25 V, which means that nickel is a reducing agent and will tend to donate electrons to other species in solution.

The pH of the solution is 4, which means that the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) is 10^(-4) M.

The partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel can be calculated using the Nernst equation:

E = E0 - (RT/nF) ln(Q)

where E is the cell potential, E0 is the standard reduction potential, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is Faraday's constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

In this case, the reaction is:

Ni(s) + 2H+ (aq) -> Ni2+ (aq) + H2 (g)

The reaction quotient, Q, is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants, raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. In this case, the reaction quotient is:

Q = [Ni2+] / [H+]^2

Substituting the given values into the Nernst equation, we get:

E = -0.25 V - (8.314 J K-1 mol-1 * 298 K / (2 * 96500 C mol-1)) * ln([0.06 M] / [10^-4 M]^2)

E = -0.25 V - 0.0295 V

E = -0.2795 V

The partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel can be calculated using the Nernst equation for the hydrogen electrode:

E = E0 - (RT/nF) ln(P_H2 / [H+]^2)

where E is the cell potential, E0 is the standard reduction potential of the hydrogen electrode (0 V), R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2), F is Faraday's constant, P_H2 is the partial pressure of hydrogen, and [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions.

Substituting the given values into the Nernst equation, we get:

P_H2 = 10^-4 M * exp((-0.2795 V * 2 * 96500 C mol-1) / (8.314 J K-1 mol-1 * 298 K))

A plain carbon steel sample containing 0.1 wt% carbon is undergoing carburization at 1100 ° C in a carbon rich surroundings with fixed carbon content of 1.0 wt% all the time. The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer). ,"

The given information is:

Diffusivity of carbon in iron at 1100 °C: 6.0* $10^(-11)m^(2).s^(-1)
Carbon concentration in the surroundings: 1.0 wt%
Carbon concentration at a depth of 5mm: 0.46 wt%

To calculate the carburization time, we can use the following equation:

C(x, t) = C_s - (C_s - C_0) * erf(x / (2 * sqrt(D * t)))

where:

C(x, t) is the carbon concentration at a depth x and time t
C_s is the carbon concentration in the surroundings
C_0 is the initial carbon concentration in the steel sample
D is the diffusivity of carbon in iron
t is the carburization time

Substituting the given values, we have:

0.46 = 1.0 - (1.0 - 0.1) * erf(5 / (2 * sqrt(6.0* $10^(-11) * t)))

Solving for t, we get:

t = 1.04 * $10^(10) seconds

Converting to hours, we have:

t = 2.89 * $10^(6) hours

Therefore, the carburization time necessary to achieve a carbon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is approximately 2.89 * $10^(6) hours.

Answer: 2.89 * $10^(6) hours

Transport phenomena,9,G-XEC-2022-18,NUM,77,"Diffusivity of A in the solid is given by: $D_A$ = $(D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_(B)T})$. $(D_A)°$: Diffusivity coefficient, $E_a$: Activation energy = 0.3 eV, $k_B$:  Boltzmann’s constant = 8.62*$10^(-5)$eV/K, 𝑇: Absolute temperature. It is known that component A diffuses into a solid to a depth of 10 μm in 1 hour at 300 K. Treat diffusion in one dimension. The time(in seconds) taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K is? (Round off to 1 decimal). ","

The time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K can be calculated using the given equation for diffusivity.

Let's denote the time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K as $t_{600}$.

We can use the given equation for diffusivity to calculate the diffusivity of A at 600 K, $D_{A,600}$:

$D_{A,600} = (D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_(B)T})$

Substituting the values for $E_a$, $k_B$, and $T$ (600 K) into the equation, we get:

$D_{A,600} = (D_A)°*exp(-{0.3 eV/8.62*10^(-5)eV/K*600 K})$

$D_{A,600} = (D_A)°*exp(-{0.3 eV/4.572*10^(-2)eV})$

$D_{A,600} = (D_A)°*exp(-6.56)$

$D_{A,600} = (D_A)°*0.0014$

Now, we can use the equation for the depth of diffusion, $x$, to calculate the time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K:

$x = \sqrt{D_{A,600}*t_{600}}$

Substituting the values for $x$ (10 μm) and $D_{A,600}$ into the equation, we get:

$10 μm = \sqrt{0.0014*(D_A)°*t_{600}}$

Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:

$100 μm^2 = 0.0014*(D_A)°*t_{600}$

Dividing both sides of the equation by $0.0014*(D_A)°$, we get:

$t_{600} = \frac{100 μm^2}{0.0014*(D_A)°}$

Now, we can use the equation for the depth of diffusion at 300 K, $x_{300}$, to calculate the value of $(D_A)°$:

$x_{300} = \sqrt{D_{A,300}*t_{300}}$

Substituting the values for $x_{300}$ (10 μm) and $t_{300}$ (1 hour = 3600 seconds) into the equation, we get:

$10 μm = \sqrt{D_{A,300}*3600 s}$

Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:

$100 μm^2 = D_{A,300}*3600 s$

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3600 s, we get:

$D_{A,300} = \frac{100 μm^2}{3600 s}$

Substituting the value for $D_{A,300}$ into the equation for $D_{A,600}$, we get:

$D_{A,600} = \frac{100 μm^2}{3600 s}*exp(-6.56)$

$D_{A,600} = 0.0014*\frac{100 μm^2}{3600 s}$

Substituting the value for $D_{A,600}$ into the equation for $t_{600}$, we get:

$t_{600} = \frac{100 μm^2}{0.0014*0.0014*\frac{100 μm^2}{3600 s}}$

$t_{600} = \frac{3600 s}{0.0014*0.0014}$

where D is the diffusivity, D0 is the pre-exponential factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Since the diffusivity at 1373 K is 10 times greater than the diffusivity at 1273 K, the time required to achieve the same extent of homogenization at 1373 K will be 1/10th of the time required at 1273 K.

The corrosion rate is the rate at which a material is corroded, usually measured in units of mass per unit area per unit time. In this case, the corrosion rate can be calculated as follows:

Corrosion rate = (Weight loss) / (Exposed surface area * Time)

Substituting the given values:

Corrosion rate = (200g) / (50 $cm^2$ * 10 years)

Converting the units to $kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$:

Corrosion rate = (200g) / (50 $cm^2$ * 10 years) * (1 $kg$ / 1000g) * (1 $m^2$ / 10000 $cm^2$) * (1 year / 365 days)

Corrosion rate = 0.00000115 $kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the corrosion rate is 0 $kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$.

Therefore, the corrosion rate is 0 $kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$.

The best magnetostrictive material is (A) $Nd_2Fe_(14)B$ (B) $Fe_3O_4$ (C) $Cu_2MnAl$ (D) $ZnFe_2O_4$

Answer:

The best magnetostrictive material is $Nd_2Fe_(14)B$.

Explanation:

Magnetostrictive materials are materials that change their shape or dimensions in response to an applied magnetic field. The best magnetostrictive material is the one that exhibits the highest magnetostriction, which is the change in length or volume of a material in response to an applied magnetic field.

Among the options given, $Nd_2Fe_(14)B$ is the best magnetostrictive material. It is a rare-earth-iron-boron alloy that exhibits a high magnetostriction coefficient, which means that it undergoes a significant change in length or volume when subjected to a magnetic field. It is widely used in various applications, such as sensors, actuators, and transducers, due to its high magnetostriction and good mechanical properties.

$Fe_3O_4$ (magnetite) and $ZnFe_2O_4$ (zinc ferrite) are also magnetostrictive materials, but they have lower magnetostriction coefficients compared to $Nd_2Fe_(14)B$. $Cu_2MnAl$ is not a magnetostrictive material, but it is a shape memory alloy that exhibits a shape memory effect, which is the ability to return to its original shape after being deformed.

Therefore, the best magnetostrictive material is $Nd_2Fe_(14)B$.

The correct answer is: (B) P-4, Q-1, R-3, S-2

Explanation:

Ferromagnetic materials have a permanent magnetic moment even in the absence of an external magnetic field. They are strongly attracted to magnets and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets themselves. Examples of ferromagnetic materials include iron, nickel, cobalt, and some of their alloys.

Ferrimagnetic materials have a net magnetic moment due to the unequal alignment of magnetic moments in the material. They are also strongly attracted to magnets and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets. Examples of ferrimagnetic materials include magnetite (Fe3O4) and ferrites.

Antiferromagnetic materials have magnetic moments that are aligned in opposite directions, resulting in a net magnetic moment of zero. They are not attracted to magnets and cannot be magnetized. Examples of antiferromagnetic materials include nickel oxide (NiO) and manganese oxide (MnO).

Paramagnetic materials have a weak magnetic moment that is induced by an external magnetic field. They are weakly attracted to magnets and can be magnetized, but the magnetization is temporary and disappears when the external magnetic field is removed. Examples of paramagnetic materials include sodium (Na), aluminum (Al), and oxygen (O2).

The correct answer is (C) (ii) and (iii).

Explanation:

Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of how easily a material can be magnetized in the presence of an external magnetic field. It is defined as the ratio of the magnetization (M) to the applied magnetic field (H).

The sign of the magnetic susceptibility determines the type of magnetic behavior of the material. A positive susceptibility indicates that the material is paramagnetic, meaning that it is attracted to a magnetic field. A negative susceptibility indicates that the material is diamagnetic, meaning that it is repelled by a magnetic field.

Diamagnetic materials have a negative susceptibility because the applied magnetic field induces a magnetic moment in the material that opposes the applied field. This is due to the fact that the electrons in the material are paired and have no net magnetic moment.

Antiferromagnetic materials have a negative susceptibility because the magnetic moments of the atoms or molecules in the material are aligned in opposite directions, resulting in a net magnetic moment of zero.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) (ii) and (iii).

Explanation:

Diamagnetic materials are repelled by an external magnetic field, while ferromagnetic materials are attracted to it.

The correct answer is (C).

Explanation:

The saturation magnetization of an FCC metal with lattice parameter 0.2 nm is 600 kA/m. The net magnetic moment per atom is given by (in Bohr magneton) 0.517.

The net magnetic moment per atom is calculated using the formula:

M = (N/V) * (μB/atom)

where M is the saturation magnetization, N is the number of atoms per unit volume, V is the volume of the unit cell, and μB is the Bohr magneton.

The lattice parameter of an FCC metal is 0.2 nm, which means that the volume of the unit cell is (0.2 nm)^3 = 0.008 nm^3. The number of atoms per unit volume is 4, since there are 4 atoms in an FCC unit cell.

Therefore, the net magnetic moment per atom is:

M = (4/0.008 nm^3) * (μB/atom)

M = 500 μB/nm^3

M = 500 * 10^-9 A/m

M = 0.517 Bohr magneton

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

The correct answer is (A) P - Diamagnetism, Q - Antiferromagnetism, R - Paramagnetism, S - Ferromagnetism.

Explanation:

Diamagnetism:
- Diamagnetism is a weak form of magnetism that occurs in all materials.
- It is caused by the orbital motion of electrons around the nucleus.
- In the absence of an external magnetic field, the magnetic moments of the electrons cancel each other out.
- When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetic moments of the electrons align in the opposite direction to the field, resulting in a weak repulsive force.

Paramagnetism:
- Paramagnetism is a form of magnetism that occurs in materials that have unpaired electrons.
- In the absence of an external magnetic field, the magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons are randomly oriented.
- When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons align in the same direction as the field, resulting in a weak attractive force.

Ferromagnetism:
- Ferromagnetism is a form of magnetism that occurs in materials that have a large number of unpaired electrons.
- In the absence of an external magnetic field, the magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons are aligned in the same direction, resulting in a strong magnetic field.
- When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons align in the same direction as the field, resulting in a strong attractive force.

Antiferromagnetism:
- Antiferromagnetism is a form of magnetism that occurs in materials that have a large number of unpaired electrons.
- In the absence of an external magnetic field, the magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons are aligned in opposite directions, resulting in a weak magnetic field.
- When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons align in the opposite direction to the field, resulting in a weak repulsive force.

Based on the above explanations, the correct mapping of nature of magnetism to atomic dipole moments is:

P - Diamagnetism
Q - Antiferromagnetism
R - Paramagnetism
S - Ferromagnetism

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P - Diamagnetism, Q - Antiferromagnetism, R - Paramagnetism, S - Ferromagnetism.

Material characterization,0,G-XEC-2012-8,MCQS,25,Microstrain can be measured by X-ray diffraction using peak  (A) Area and intensity (B) Position and area (C) Broadening and intensity (D) Position and broadening ,"

The correct answer is: (D) Position and broadening

Explanation:

Microstrain can be measured by X-ray diffraction using peak position and broadening. The peak position is related to the lattice spacing, while the peak broadening is related to the microstrain.

Here are the steps to measure microstrain using X-ray diffraction:

1. Obtain the X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample.
2. Identify the peaks in the pattern and measure their positions and broadening.
3. Calculate the lattice spacing from the peak positions.
4. Calculate the microstrain from the peak broadening.

The microstrain is related to the peak broadening by the following equation:

β = 2ε tan θ

where β is the peak broadening, ε is the microstrain, and θ is the Bragg angle.

The microstrain can be calculated from the peak broadening using the following equation:

ε = β / 2 tan θ

The microstrain is a measure of the local deformation of the crystal lattice. It is caused by the presence of defects, such as dislocations, vacancies, and interstitials. The microstrain can affect the physical and chemical properties of the material, such as its strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance.

Here are some additional details about microstrain:

* The microstrain is a tensor quantity, which means that it has a direction and a magnitude.
* The microstrain can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of the deformation.
* The microstrain can be anisotropic, which means that it can vary in different directions.
* The microstrain can be measured using other techniques, such as neutron diffraction and electron diffraction.

Rather than using a ray of light, an electron beam is used by the SEM and is guided into the sample under observation [ 15]. An electron gun shoots out a beam of highly focused electrons centered on the top of the unit. When the sample is struck by an electron beam known as the incident beam, three categories of electrons and X-rays are released. These includes Auger electrons, backscattered electrons, and secondary electrons. In the SEM, backscatter and secondary electrons are used. The rebounding electrons are picked up, and an electron recorder logs their imprint. These data are translated on a computer and help the three-dimensional dimensions be clearly represented [ 16]. The capability of SEM to reproduce textual information consistently and simply is one of the greatest advantages. Since the electrons provide limited data about the topography and sample size,

The correct answer is (C) secondary electron and back-scatter electron, respectively.

Explanation:

In a typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) image, information about topography is obtained from secondary electrons, while information about atomic contrast is obtained from back-scatter electrons.

Secondary electrons are low-energy electrons that are emitted from the surface of the sample when it is bombarded with a high-energy electron beam. These electrons are used to create a topographic image of the sample surface, as their intensity is related to the angle of the surface relative to the electron beam.

Back-scatter electrons, on the other hand, are high-energy electrons that are reflected back from the sample surface when it is bombarded with the electron beam. These electrons are used to create an image of the sample's atomic composition, as their intensity is related to the atomic number of the elements in the sample.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) secondary electron and back-scatter electron, respectively.

Mass flow rate = 7000 * 0.80 * (3.14 * (30/2)^2) * Square root of (2 * 9.81 * 3.2)

Mass flow rate = 105,840.7 kg/s

Therefore, the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle is 105,840.7 kg/s.

Ignore the fluid friction due to viscosity and the drag due to changes in the direction of flow. If the volume of the mold cavity is 10 $m^3$, then the time(in seconds) required to fill the mold is?(roound off to nearest integer)","

The time required to fill the mold can be calculated using the equation for the velocity of a freely falling object:

v = sqrt(2gh)

where v is the velocity of the liquid metal, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height from which the liquid metal is falling.

The volume of the mold cavity is given as 10 m^3, and the cross-sectional area of the gate is 0.2 m^2. The time required to fill the mold can be calculated as:

t = V/A*v

where V is the volume of the mold cavity, A is the cross-sectional area of the gate, and v is the velocity of the liquid metal.

Substituting the given values, we get:

t = 10 m^3 / (0.2 m^2 * sqrt(2 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.5 m))

t = 10 m^3 / (0.2 m^2 * 3.13 m/s)

t = 15.97 s

Answer:

The correct answer is (B) The fluid pressure at the point A exceeds that at point O by the amount 𝜌$v^2$/2 , where 𝒗 is the fluid velocity at point O.

Explanation:

The velocity of the fluid at the point A is not zero because the flow is horizontal and fully developed far from the object. The fluid pressure at the point A exceeds that at point O by the amount 𝜌$v^2$/2 , where 𝒗 is the fluid velocity at point O, due to the Bernoulli's principle. Fluid moving precisely along OA will not turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object because the flow is horizontal and fully developed far from the object. On each side of the central streamline OA, the flow will be deflected round the object due to the presence of the object.

Ladle deoxidation of liquid steel is done at 1600°C by adding ferro-aluminium. By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?","

The given information is:

- Density of steel: 7000 kg/$m^3$
- Density of alumina: 3650 kg/$m^3$
- Viscosity of steel: 6*$10^(-3)$ kg/m/s
- Temperature: 1600°C
- Diameter of alumina particles: 50 µm
- Depth: 2m

To calculate the time required for the alumina particles to float to the surface, we can use Stokes' law, which relates the terminal velocity of a spherical particle in a fluid to the properties of the particle and the fluid.

Stokes' law:

$v = \frac{2}{9} \frac{(\rho_p - \rho_f) g r^2}{\mu}$

where:

- $v$ is the terminal velocity of the particle (m/s)
- $\rho_p$ is the density of the particle (kg/$m^3$)
- $\rho_f$ is the density of the fluid (kg/$m^3$)
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (m/$s^2$)
- $r$ is the radius of the particle (m)
- $\mu$ is the viscosity of the fluid (kg/m/s)

Substituting the given values into the equation:

$v = \frac{2}{9} \frac{(3650 - 7000) \times 9.81 \times (50 \times 10^{-6})^2}{6 \times 10^{-3}}$

$v = -0.000131$ m/s

The negative sign indicates that the particle is moving downwards.

To calculate the time required for the particle to float to the surface, we can use the following equation:

$t = \frac{h}{v}$

where:

- $t$ is the time required (s)
- $h$ is the depth (m)

Substituting the values:

$t = \frac{2}{-0.000131}$

$t = -15267.17$ s

The negative sign indicates that the particle is moving downwards.

Therefore, the time required for the alumina particles to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be -15267.17 seconds.

Please note that the negative sign indicates that the particle is moving downwards, which is not possible in this case. Therefore, the time required for the alumina particles to float to the surface would be 15267.17 seconds.

The correct answer is (D) 1 and 4.

Explanation:

Liquid penetration test and eddy current method are not applicable for detecting internal flaws in a ceramic material.

Liquid penetration test is a surface inspection technique that is used to detect surface discontinuities such as cracks, porosity, and other surface defects. It is not suitable for detecting internal flaws in a ceramic material.

Eddy current method is a non-destructive testing technique that is used to detect surface and subsurface defects in conductive materials. Ceramic materials are non-conductive, and therefore, eddy current method is not applicable for detecting internal flaws in a ceramic material.

Radiography and ultrasonic testing are applicable for detecting internal flaws in a ceramic material.

Radiography is a non-destructive testing technique that uses X-rays or gamma rays to detect internal flaws in a material. It is suitable for detecting internal flaws in a ceramic material.

Ultrasonic testing is a non-destructive testing technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to detect internal flaws in a material. It is suitable for detecting internal flaws in a ceramic material.

(A) Dye penetrant test (B) Magnetic particle inspection (C) Ultrasonic inspection (D) Acoustic emission,"

The correct answer is (C) Ultrasonic inspection.

Explanation:

Ultrasonic inspection is a non-destructive testing technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to detect and quantify defects in materials. It is particularly well-suited for detecting and quantifying defects such as scale on the inner surface of a long oil pipeline made of steel.

The ultrasonic waves are transmitted through the material and are reflected back to the transducer when they encounter a discontinuity or defect. The time it takes for the waves to travel through the material and back to the transducer is used to calculate the depth and size of the defect.

Ultrasonic inspection is a reliable and accurate method for detecting and quantifying defects in materials, and it is commonly used in the oil and gas industry to inspect pipelines and other equipment.

The correct answer is (D) Capillary action.

Here's the explanation:

The dye penetrant test is a nondestructive testing method used to detect surface discontinuities in nonporous materials. It is based on the principle of capillary action, which is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of external forces.

In the dye penetrant test, a colored or fluorescent dye is applied to the surface of the material being tested. The dye is allowed to penetrate into any surface discontinuities, such as cracks or pores, through capillary action. After a sufficient amount of time, the excess dye is removed from the surface, and a developer is applied. The developer draws the dye out of the discontinuities, making them visible under ultraviolet or white light, depending on the type of dye used.

The dye penetrant test is a simple and effective method for detecting surface discontinuities in a wide range of materials, including metals, ceramics, and plastics. It is commonly used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing to ensure the quality and safety of products.

Miscellaneous,7,G-META-20-44,NUM,41,"Given, density of oxide is 6.5 $g.cm^(-3)$. A metal oxidizes at 1200K with a parabolic rate constant of 3* $10^(-6)g^(2).cm^(-4).s^(-1)$. Time taken(in seconds) for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is?(round off to two decimal places). ","

The given information is:

Density of oxide: 6.5 g/cm^3
Parabolic rate constant: 3*10^(-6) g^2.cm^(-4).s^(-1)
Temperature: 1200K
Thickness of oxide film: 2 µm

To calculate the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm, we can use the parabolic rate equation:

x^2 = kt

where:

x is the thickness of the oxide film (in cm)
k is the parabolic rate constant (in g^2.cm^(-4).s^(-1))
t is the time taken (in seconds)

To convert the thickness of the oxide film from µm to cm, we can use the conversion factor:

1 µm = 10^(-4) cm

Therefore, the thickness of the oxide film in cm is:

x = 2 µm = 2 * 10^(-4) cm

Substituting the given values into the parabolic rate equation, we get:

(2 * 10^(-4) cm)^2 = (3*10^(-6) g^2.cm^(-4).s^(-1)) * t

Simplifying the equation, we get:

t = (2 * 10^(-4) cm)^2 / (3*10^(-6) g^2.cm^(-4).s^(-1))

Solving for t, we get:

t = 133.33 seconds

Therefore, the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is 133.33 seconds.

Answer: 133.33 seconds
