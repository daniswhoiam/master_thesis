(A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap (B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap (C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap (D) Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap ","A. Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap.

Explanation:

An LED emits light through the recombination of electrons and holes in the depletion region. The energy difference between the electron and hole energy levels when they recombine determines the wavelength of the emitted light. A direct bandgap material allows for the direct transfer of electrons to the valence band, which is more efficient for light emission compared to an indirect bandgap material where momentum conservation must be satisfied.

If 100 g of water that is at 90 °C is added to the cup, the final temperature of water in °C is","To find the final temperature of water after adding 100 g of water at 90 °C to the copper cup containing 80 g of water at 4 °C, we need to apply the principle of conservation of energy.

First, let's calculate the initial energy of the system:

Einitial = m1 * Cp1 * ΔT1 + m2 * Cp2 * ΔT1

where:
m1 = mass of water in the cup = 80 g
Cp1 = specific heat capacity of water = 4.18 J/g °C
ΔT1 = change inital temperature of water = 96 °C (90 °C - 4 °C)
m2 = mass of copper cup = 140 g
Cp2 = specific heat capacity of copper = 0.385 J/g °C

Einitial = 80g * 4.18J/g °C * 96°C + 140g * 0.385J/g °C * ΔTfinal

Next, let's calculate the energy of the system after adding 100 g of water at 

Efinal = m1 * Cp1 * ΔTfinal + m2 * Cp2 * ΔTfinal + m3 * Cp3 * ΔTfinal

where:
m3 = mass of added water = 100 g
Cp3 = specific heat capacity of water = 4.18 J/g °C

Since the final temperature is the same for all components in the system, we can set ΔT1 = ΔTfinal and solve for it:

ΔTfinal = [(m1 * Cp1 + m2 * Cp2 + m3 * Cp3) * Efinal - (m1 * Cp1 * ΔT1 + m2 * Cp2 * ΔT1)] / [(m1 * Cp1 + m2 * Cp2 + m3 * Cp3)]

Substituting the given values:

ΔTfinal = [(80g * 4.18J/g °C + 140g * 0.385J/g °C + 100g * 4.18J/g °C) * Efinal - (80g * 4.18J/g °C * 96°C + 140g * 0.385J/g °C * ΔTfinal)] / [(80g * 4.18J/g °C + 140g * 0.385J/g °C + 100g * 4.18J/g °C)]

Solving for ΔTfinal:

ΔTfinal = [(80g * 4.18J/g °C + 140g * 0.385J/g °C + 100g * 4.18J/g °C) * Efinal - (80g * 4.18J/g °C * 96°C)] / [(80g * 4.18J/g °C + 140g * 0.385J/g °C + 100g * 4.18J/g °C + 140g * 0.385J/g °C)]

To find the final temperature, we need to know the final energy of the system (Efinal). Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to calculate it directly. However, we can make some assumptions and estimate the final temperature based on the given information.

Assuming that all the heat added goes into raising the temperature of the water, we can calculate the final temperature using the heat added:

To find the energy in eV, the answer is (A) 4.494 eV.

To find the wavelength in μm, we can use the relationship between energy and wavelength:

Calculate the original length of the iron rail track in cm. (linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$)","To find the original length of the iron rail track, we can use the given information about the change in length with temperature and the thermal expansion coefficient of iron.

First, let's find the temperature difference: ΔT = 45°C - 15°C = 30°C

Next, we can calculate the change in length using the linear thermal expansion coefficient: ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT, where α is the thermal expansion coefficient, L0 is the original length, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

We are given ΔL = 0.05 cm and α = 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$.

Now we can solve for L0:

ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT
0.05 cm = 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$ * L0 * 30°C

To get rid of the units, let's convert everything to SI units:

0.05 cm = 0.0005 m = 5 * $10^(-4)$ m
30°C = ≈ 30 + 273.15 = 303.15 K

Now we have:

5 * $10^(-4)$ m = 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$ * L0 * 303.15 K

Divide both sides by 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$:

L0 = (5 * $10^(-4)$ m) / (11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$ * 303.15 K)

Explanation:

The Fermi energy is the energy level for which the probability of occupancy is exactly 0.5 for a typical metal at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

First, let's find the first derivative of U(r):

dU/dr = d/dr [−(A/r^3) + (B/r^7)]

Using the power rule of differentiation, we get:

dU/dr = [−3A/r^4 + 7B/r^8]

Setting this equal to zero and solving for r, we get:

3A/x = 7B/x^2

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3Ax = 7Bx^2

Dividing both sides by 3A, we get:

x = 7B/3A

Now, we can find the value of r by taking the fourth root of x:

The lowest value of $T_f$( in °C) at which material will fail is?(round off to the nearest integer.). Assume that there is no plastic deformation during thermal cycling. ","To calculate the lowest value of $T\_f$ at which the material will fail, we can use the equation for thermal stress developed in the material:

rT = EaDT

where $r\_T$ is the thermal stress, $E$ is the modulus of modulus elasticity, $a$ is the linear coefficient of thermal expansion, and $D\_T$ is the temperature change.

Since the material is dimensionally constrained during thermal cycling, the thermal strain $e$ is given by:

e = aDT

Substituting the given values, we have:

e = (7.5 * 10^(-6) °C^(-1)) * (T\_f - 25 °C)

The maximum compressive stress that the material can withstand without failure is 200 MPa. Therefore, we can find the lowest value of $T\_f$ by setting the thermal stress equal to the maximum compressive stress:

rT = 200 MPa

Substituting the expression for thermal stress and solving for $T\_f$, we get:

T\_f = \frac{200 \text{ MPa}}{200 \text{ GPa} * 7.5 * 10^(-6) °C^(-1)} + 25 °C

0 = 4πr²γsl - (4/3)πr³ΔGv

(A) Low deposition rate and low substrate temperature (B) Low deposition rate and high substrate temperature (C) High deposition rate and low substrate temperature (D) High deposition rate and high substrate temperature,"The conditions that favour the formation of larger grains in thin films are (B) low deposition rate and high substrate temperature, and (D) high deposition rate and high substrate temperature.

Explanation:

The size of grains in thin films is determined by various factors, including the surface mobility of adsorbed atoms and clusters during deposition, substrate temperature, total film thickness, and subsequent annealing temperatures.

According to the context provided, a high surface mobility allows adsorbed atoms to move larger distances before being incorporated into growing nuclei, resulting in larger crystallites and smaller concentrations of nuclei. The substrate temperature is the most significant factor contributing to high mobility, and therefore grain size tends to increase with increasing substrate temperature.

Additionally, high deposition rates and high substrate temperatures can also lead to larger grains due to increased surface diffusion and bulk diffusion, respectively. Bulk diffusion becomes active at high substrate temperatures, allowing atoms within the grains to move and coalesce, resulting in larger equiaxed grains.

Therefore, options (B) and (D) are the correct answers. Option (A) is incorrect because low deposition rates and low substrate temperatures result in smaller grains due to shadowing dominating the microstructure and the low energy of adatoms. Option (C) is incorrect because high deposition rates and low substrate temperatures result in smaller grains due to the lack of energy for surface diffusion and the formation of columnar grains with voids between them.",,,0,

The absorption coefficient (α) of germanium at 1.3 µm is 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$.," To find the thickness (l) of a germanium crystal layer required for absorbing 80% of the incident radiation, we can use the Beer-Lambert law, which states that the intensity (I) of radiation transmitted through a material is given by:

I = I0 * exp(-α * l)

where I0 is the initial intensity of radiation, α is the absorption coefficient, and l is the thickness of the material.

We want to find the thickness (l) such that I = 0.2 * I0, which means that 80% of the incident radiation is absorbed.

Therefore, we have:

0.2 * I0 = I0 * exp(-α * l)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

ln(0.2) = ln(1) - ln(I0/I)

Using the property of logarithms, we can simplify this equation as:

ln(0.2) = ln(I/I0)

Now, we can use the Beer-Lambert law to express I/I0 in terms of l:

I/I0 = exp(-α * l)

Substituting this expression into the previous equation, we get:

ln(0.2) = ln[exp(-α * l)]

Using the property of logarithms again, we can write this as:

ln(0.2) = -α * l * ln(e)

Solving for l, we get:

l = ln(0.2) / (α * ln(e))

Substituting the given value of α = 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$, we get:

l = ln(0.2) / (3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$ * ln(e))

Using a calculator, we find that:

l = 1.59 * $10^(-5)$ $m$ = 1.59 * $10^(-3)$ $µm$

Therefore, the thickness of the germanium crystal layer required for absorbing 80% of the incident radiation whose wavelength is 1.3 µm is approximately 1.59 * $10^(-3)$ $µm$ or 1.59 * $10^(-3)$ $nm$.",,,0,

Specific surface area = 6 × π² × (diameter / 2)² × (number of particles / total volume)

We are given the specific surface area (125 m²/g), the density of titania (4.23 g/cm³), and we need to find the diameter in nanometers.

First, we need to convert the specific surface area to m²/cm³:

125 m²/g × 1 g/cm³ = 125 m²/cm³

Next, we can rearrange the given equation to find the diameter:

diameter² = (6 × π² × (number of particles / total volume))⁻¹ × (specific surface area)

We don't have the number of particles or the total volume, but we can calculate them using the given density and the mass of the batch:

Mass of batch = (specific surface area)⁻¹ × (density)

Mass of batch = (125 m²/cm³)⁻¹ × (4.23 g/cm³) = 0.0328 g

Total volume of batch = Mass of batch / Density

Total volume of batch = 0.0328 g / 4.23 g/cm³ = 0.0077 cm³

Now we can calculate the number of particles:

Number of particles = (mass of batch) / (mass of one particle)

Mass of one particle = (4/3)π(diameter/2)³ × (density)

We don't know the diameter yet, but we can set up an equation and solve for it:

Number of particles = (mass of batch) / [(4/3)π(diameter/2)³ × (density)]

1 = (0.0328 g) / [(4/3)π(diameter/2)³ × (4.23 g/cm³)]

Solving this equation for diameter, we get:

diameter = 2 × √[(3/4) × (mass of batch / (number of particles × π × (density)²))]

Substituting the known values, we get:

diameter = 2 × √[(3/4) × (0.0328 g / (1 × π × (4.23 g/cm³)²)]

Calculating the value, we get:

E = 3.32 * $10^(-19$ J

Number of photons = (Number of atoms in the upper level) * (Energy released per atom) / (Energy of a single photon)

Number of photons = (7 * $10^(20)$) * (Energy released per atom) / (3.32 * $10^(-19$ J))

Since the energy released per atom is the difference between the energy of the upper and lower levels, we can find it using the given wavelength:

Energy released per atom = hc/λ = 3.32 * $10^(-19$ J)

Now we can calculate the number of photons:

Number of photons = (7 * $10^(20)$) * (3.32 * $10^(-19$ J)) / (3.32 * $10^(-19$ J)) = 7 * $10^(20)$

Finally, we can find the energy released in a single pulse by multiplying the number of photons by the energy of energy of energy of a single photon:

Energy released in a single pulse = (Number of photons) * (Energy of a single photon)
Energy released in a single pulse = 7 * $10^(20)$ * (3.32 * $10^(-19$ J)) = 2.32 * $10^(-1$ J

Δp = m * Δv = 9.1 * $10^(31)$ kg * 3 m/s = 2.79 * $10^(-32)$ kg m/s

First, we need to convert the activation energy to Joules:

250 kJ/mol = 250,000 J/mol

Next, we need to calculate the Gibbs free energy of Schottky defect formation:

ΔGf = ΔHf - TΔSf

where ΔHf is the enthalpy of formation and ΔSf is the entropy of formation. Since the given information does not provide these values, we cannot calculate the exact Gibbs free energy of Schottky defect formation. However, we can use a reasonable approximation for the entropy of formation based on the number of degrees of freedom of the ions in the crystal lattice.

The percentage increase in volume is given by:

% increase in volume = [(L2 * W2) / (L1 * W1)]^(1/3) - 1

We can find L2 and W2 using the linear thermal expansion coefficients and the temperature change:

L2 = L1 * (1 + 0.8 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * (1100 K - 900 K))
W2 = W1 * (1 + 29 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * (1100 K - 900 K))

Substituting these values into the equation for percentage increase in volume, we get:

% increase in volume = [(L2 * W2) / (L1 * W1)]^(1/3) - 1

Calculating the values of L2, W2, and the percentage increase in volume, we get:

Island type of growth must be avoided. The student performs an extensive optimization exercise. Which one of the following steps is in the right direction?   (A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing"," The correct answer is (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited.

Explanation:

The goal is to deposit a thin metallic film on a $SiO_2$ substrate with an adhesion layer between them to ensure good adhesion and avoid island type growth. The interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the substrate plays a crucial role in the adhesion strength. Therefore, choosing a metallic adhesion layer with a very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$ is the right direction to ensure strong adhesion between the substrate and the deposited thin film.

The other options are not necessarily incorrect but may not directly contribute to achieving the goal of good adhesion and avoiding island type growth. For example, increasing the substrate temperature and decreasing the deposition rate may improve the film quality, but they do not directly address the interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the substrate. Using intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing may help improve the film properties, but it does not guarantee good adhesion or prevent island type growth unless the interfacial energy is properly controlled.",,,0,

The resistivity of a pure semiconductor at 298 K is 3000 Ωm. Assume that the number of electrons excited ($𝑛_e$) across the band gap is given by the relation $n_e$ = $(N_A)*exp(-{E_g/k_(B)T})$. The band gap(in ev) ($𝐸_g$) of the semiconductor is? (Round off to two decimals) "," To find the band gap energy ($𝐸_g$), we can use the given information about the resistivity ($ρ$) of the pure semiconductor and the mobilities of electrons ($μ_n$) and holes ($μ_p$) in the semiconductor. The resistivity is related to the carrier densities ($n_e$ and $p_h$) and their mobilities through the conductivity equation:

$σ = ne μ_n + p_h μ_p$

Since we are dealing with a pure semiconductor, the number of electrons and holes are equal ($n_e = p_h$), and the Fermi level is at the middle of the band gap. Therefore, we can use the mass-action law to relate the carrier densities:

$n_e = n_0 = p_0 = N_c e N_v e exp(-E_g / k_B T)$

where $N_c$ and $N_v$ are the effective density-of-states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. We can simplify this equation by assuming that $N_c$ and $N_v$ are constant and equal, and that $N_A$ is the effective density-of-states in the conduction band. Then,

$n_e = N_A exp(-E_g / k_B T)$

Now, we can use the given information about the resistivity to find $E_g$:

$ρ = \frac{1}{σ} = \frac{1}{ne μ_n + p_h μ_p} = \frac{1}{n_e^2 (\mu_n + \mu_p)}$

Substituting $n_e = N_A exp(-E_g / k_B T)$ and simplifying, we get:

$E_g = k_B T \ln \left(\frac{N_A}{2} \left(\frac{1}{μ_n} + \frac{1}{μ_p}\right)\right)$

In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places) ","To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel, we need to use the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients for the given refractive index and absorption coefficient.

The reflection coefficient R and transmission coefficient T can be calculated using the following equations:

R = [(n2 - n1) / (n2 + n1 + n1)]2 + [(n2k2) / (n2 n1 + n1)]2
T = 1 - R

where n1 is the refractive index of the incident medium (air, assumed to be 1), n2 is the refractive index of the glass material, and k is the absorption coefficient.

First, let's find the reflection and transmission coefficients for the minimum absorption coefficient (0.3 $cm^(-1)$).

n1 = 1, n2 = 1.5, k1 = 0.3

R1 = [(1.5 - 1) / (1.5 × 1 + 1)]2 + [(1.5 × 0.3) / (1.5 × 1 + 1)]2
R1 ≈ 0.053

T1 = 1 - R1 ≈ 0.947

Next, let's find the reflection and transmission coefficients for the maximum absorption coefficient (1 $cm^(-1)$).

n1 = 1, n2 = 1.5, k2 = = ≈ 1

R2 = [(1.5 - 1) / (1.5 × 1 + 1)]2 + [(1.5 × 1) / (1.5 × 1 + 1)]2
R2 ≈ 0.436

T2 = 1 - R2 ≈ 0.564

Now, we can find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel:

Ratio = T1 / T2 = T2 / T1 / T1
Ratio = (0.564) / (0.947) ≈ 0.601

Explanation:
During the solidification of a pure metal, the liquid-solid interface is at the melting temperature. However, as the solidification progresses, the temperature in the liquid decreases due to the release of latent heat of fusion. This temperature decrease causes the temperature gradient in the liquid to become negative, which favors the growth of dendrites.

The ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ for this reaction at 1173 K is  (A) 0.0 (B) 0.25 (C) 0.44 (D) 2.3," To find the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$, we need to use the equation: 

ΔG° = ΔG°r + ΔnRTln(pA/K)

where ΔG°r is the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction, Δn is the change in the number of moles of gases, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and pA is the partial pressure of the reactant or product with the activity coefficient A.

Since we are given the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction (ΔG°r = 8120 J), we can use the equation to find the equilibrium constant (K) at 1173 K:

ΔG° = ΔG°r + ΔnRTln(pA/K)
8120 J = 8120 J + ΔnRTln(pCO/pCO2/K)

We know that for the reaction FeO + CO = Fe + $CO_2$, the stoichiometric coefficients are 1 for FeO, 1 for CO, and 1 for $CO_2$. Therefore, Δn = 2 for CO and $CO_2$.

Substituting the values, we get:

8120 J = 8120 J + 2RTln(pCO/pCO2/K)

We can rearrange this equation to find the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$:

$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ = K/(pA)^2

Since the activity coefficients for CO and $CO_2$ are assumed to be equal and close to unity, we can approximate $pA$ as the partial pressure of CO and $CO_2$.

We can find the value of K using the given ΔG°:

ΔG° = −RTlnK
8120 J = −(8.314 J/mol·K)(1173 K)lnK
lnK = −8120 J/(8.314 J/mol·K)(1173 K)
lnK = −9.31
K = e^(-9.31) = 0.00012

Substituting the value of K and the approximation of $pA$ as the partial pressure of CO, we get:

$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ = K/(pCO)^2
$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ = 0.00012/(pCO)^2

To find the value of $p_(CO)$ that satisfies this equation, we need to solve for $p_(CO)$:

$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ = 0.00012/(pCO)^2
$p_(CO)$ = sqrt(1/[0.00012/p_(CO_2)])

At 1173 K, the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ is given by:

$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ = sqrt(1/[0.00012/1.5])
$p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ = sqrt(1000)

Explanation:

The integral enthalpy of mixing for a binary solution is given by the equation:

$ΔH^{mix}$ = $ΔH^{m}$ * ($χ_A$ * $χ_B$)

where $ΔH^m$ is the maximum reversible reaction enthalpy and $χ_A$ and $χ_B$ are the mole fractions of components A and B, respectively.

In this problem, we are given the integral enthalpy of mixing for a liquid (Cu, Zn) solution, which is approximated by the equation:

$ΔH^{mix}$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

To find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we can use the Gibbs free energy of mixing equation:

$ΔG^{mix}$ = $ΔH^{mix}$ - $T$ * $ΔS^{mix}$

where $ΔS^{mix}$ is the integral entropy of mixing. Since the integral entropy of mixing for an ideal solution is zero, we can assume that the entropy change is the same for the integral and partial enthalpies of mixing. Therefore, we have:

$ΔG^{mix}$ = $ΔH^{mix}$

We can also write the Gibbs free energy of mixing equation in terms of the partial Gibbs free energies of mixing for components A and B:

$ΔG^{mix}$ = $ΔG_A^{mix}$ + $ΔG_B^{mix}$

Since the system is at constant temperature and pressure, we have:

$ΔG_A^{mix}$ = $ΔH_A^{mix}$ - $T$ * $ΔS_A^{mix}$

$ΔG_B^{mix}$ = $ΔH_B^{mix}$ - $T$ * $ΔS_B^{mix}$

At equilibrium, $ΔG^{mix}$ = 0, so we have:

$ΔH_A^{mix}$ = $ΔH_B^{mix}$

Therefore, the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu is the same as that for Zn, but with the opposite sign because we are dealing with enthalpies, not Gibbs free energies.

Using the given equation for the integral enthalpy of mixing, we have:

$ΔH_A^{mix}$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$ * $χ_(Cu)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

Since $χ_A$ and $χ_B$ are the same as $χ_(Cu)$ and $χ_(Zn)$, respectively, we have:

$ΔH_A^{mix}$ = -19250 * $(χ_(Cu))^2$ + 19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

Using the given value of $ΔH^{mix}$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$, we can solve for $ΔH_A^{mix}$:

$ΔH_A^{mix}$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$ = -19250 * $(χ_(Cu))^2$ + 19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

$-19250 * $(χ_(Cu))^2$ = $ΔH_A^{mix}$ - 19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

$ΔH_A^{mix}$ = 19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$ + 19250 * $(χ_(Cu))^2$

Therefore, the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu is 19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$ + 19250 * $(χ_(Cu))^2$.

Since $χ_(Cu)$ + $χ_(Zn)$ = 1, we have $χ_(Zn)$ = 1 - $χ_(Cu)$. Substituting this into the equation for the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we get:",,,0,

Given equation: ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(𝑥_R)^2$ - 0.2*$(𝑥_R)^3$

We want to find ln $𝛾_𝑄$ when xR = 0.6. So, we substitute xR = 0.6 into the given equation:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(0.6)^2$ - 0.2*$(0.6)^3$

Calculate the values inside the parentheses:

$(0.6)^2$ = 0.36
$(0.6)^3$ = 0.216

Now, substitute these values back into the equation:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(0.36)$ - 0.2*$(0.216)$

Calculate the products:

$0.6*(0.36)$ = 0.216
$-0.2*(0.216)$ = -0.0432

Subtract the second term from the first:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = 0.216 - 0.0432

Calculate the difference:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = 0.1728

aQ = $𝛾_𝑄$ * $x_𝑄$

We are given xQ = 1 - xR = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. So, we can find the activity of Q as follows:

aQ = $𝛾_𝑄$ * $x_𝑄$
aQ = exp(ln $𝛾_𝑄$) * 0.4
aQ = exp(0.1728) * 0.4

Calculate the exponential:

Assume that air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen.," To find the theoretical requirement of air for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$, we first need to determine the theoretical air requirement based on the stoichiometric equation for the combustion of $CH_4$ with oxygen.

The stoichiometric equation for the combustion of $CH_4$ with oxygen is:

$CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O$

From this equation, we can see that for every mole of $CH_4$, we need 2 moles of $O_2$. Since 1 mole of $O_2$ occupies approximately 22.414 $L$ (or 22.414 $m^3$) at standard temperature and pressure (STP), the theoretical requirement of air (in $m^3$ at STP) for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$ can be calculated as follows:

$Theoretical\ air\ requirement = \frac{Moles\ of\ CH_4}{Moles\ of\ O_2\ per\ mole\ of\ CH_4} \times Moles\ of\ O_2\ required \times Volume\ of\ 1\ mole\ of\ O_2\ at\ STP$

$= \frac{100}{1} \times 2 \times 22.414$

$= 448.285\ m^3$

However, since the given air contains only 21 vol.% of oxygen, we need to calculate the actual volume of air required based on the volume of oxygen.

$Actual\ volume\ of\ oxygen\ required = \frac{Theoretical\ oxygen\ requirement}{Percentage\ of\ oxygen\ in\ air}$

$= \frac{2}{21} \times 448.285$

$= 1036.11\ m^3$

$Actual\ volume\ of\ air\ required = \frac{Actual\ volume\ of\ oxygen\ required}{Percentage\ of\ oxygen\ in\ air}$

$= \frac{1036.11}{0.21}$

$= 4934.33\ m^3$

Therefore, the theoretical requirement of air (in $m^3$ at STP) for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$ is approximately 4934.33 $m^3$.",,,0,

Explanation:

The standard free energy change for a reaction is given by the equation: ∆𝐺° = ∆𝐺𝐶° − T ∆𝐺𝐽°, where ∆𝐺𝐶° is the standard enthalpy change and ∆𝐺𝐽° is the standard entropy change.

In the given reaction, 𝑥𝑀(𝑠𝑠) + $𝑂_2$(𝑔) → $𝑀_(𝑥)𝑂_2$(𝑠), the metal M is oxidized by oxygen gas ($𝑂_2$(𝑔)) to form its oxide ($𝑀_(𝑥)𝑂_2$(𝑠)). Since the reaction is an oxidation, it is exothermic, meaning that ∆𝐺𝐶° is negative.

The entropy change for the reaction, ∆𝐺𝐽°, is negative because the reaction involves the consumption of one mole of oxygen gas, and the entropy of a gas is typically greater than that of a solid. Therefore, the slope of the line representing the standard free energy change for the reaction in an Ellingham diagram is positive, as given by the equation: slope = −∆𝐺𝐽° = −(negative) = positive.

However, the answer key provided in the question is incorrect. The correct answer is (D) ∆H° is negative. The slope being positive does not imply that ∆S° is positive, but rather that ∆𝐺° is negative.",,,0,

According to Le Chatelier's principle, when $∆𝐻$ is negative, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction to decrease the negative Gibbs free energy. Conversely, when $∆𝐻$ is positive, the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction to increase the positive Gibbs free energy.

The temperature and pressure dependencies of $∆𝐻$ for the Boudouard reaction are shown in Figure 10.4 in the context provided. At 1 atm pressure, the gas is effectively pure CO2 at temperatures less than about 400°C while it is effectively pure CO at temperatures greater than about 1000°C. The minimum temperature for the reduction of an oxide by carbon is given at the point of intersection of the carbon and metal lines in Figure 11.1.

Therefore, to favor the forward reaction, we need to increase both temperature and pressure, as shown in Figure 10.4. This is because increasing temperature and pressure will shift the equilibrium towards the side of the reaction with the more negative Gibbs free energy change.

Hence, the answer is (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure.",,,0,

The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy (dE) of a system is equal to the heat (Q) added to the system minus the work (W) done by the system.

$\gamma\_{SL} = \gamma\_{SS} \cos\theta + \gamma\_{SV}$

We don't have the value of $\gamma\_{SV}$, but we can assume it to be the same for both solid-liquid and solid-solid interfaces, so we can rearrange the equation to find $\theta$:

where $ΔH°_r$ is the heat released during the reaction, $ΔH°_f$ is the heat of formation, and $ΔH°_v$ is the heat of vaporization.

First, we need to find $ΔH°_f$ for CO and $CO_2$:

$ΔH°_f$(CO) = -110,500 kJ.(kg-mol $CO)^(-1)$
$ΔH°_f$(CO$_2$) = -393,500 kJ.(kg-mol $CO$_2)^(-1)$

Next, we need to find $ΔH°_v$ for CO$_2$:

$ΔH°_v$(CO$_2$) = $C_p$(CO$_2$) × ($T_f$ - $T_i$)

where $T_f$ is the adiabatic flame temperature and $T_i$ is the initial temperature (25°C).

We can assume that the initial temperature of the reactants does not affect the heat of vaporization, so we can use the heat capacity of CO$_2$ at the adiabatic flame temperature to find $ΔH°_v$:

$ΔH°_v$(CO$_2$) = 44 kJ.(kg-mol $K)^(-1) × (T_f - 25°C)$

Now we can find $ΔH°_r$:

$ΔH°_r$ = $ΔH°_f$(CO) + $ΔH°_f$(CO$_2$) + $ΔH°_v$(CO$_2$)

$ΔH°_r$ = (-110,500 + 393,500 + 44(T_f - 25)) kJ.(kg-mol CO)^(-1)$

To find the adiabatic flame temperature, we need to set $ΔH°_r$ equal to the heat released per unit mass flow rate of CO:

$1 kg-mol.h^(-1) × ΔH°_r = 1 kg-mol.h^(-1) × (-282,000)$

$ΔH°_r = -282,000 kJ.(kg-mol CO)^(-1)$

$44(T_f - 25) + T_f(T_f - 25) = -281,81888,000$

$T_f^2 - 50,638 T_f + 281,888,000 = 0$

Solving this quadratic equation, we get:

$T_f = \frac{50,638 \pm \sqrt{50,638^2 - 4 × 44 × 281,888,000}}{2}$

The positive root gives the adiabatic flame temperature:

$T_f = \frac{50,638 + \sqrt{50,638^2 - 4 × 44 × 281,888,000}}{2} \approx 2512 K$

/Δ1G = 4πr²γls

Since we are given the surface energy γ and we want to find the critical radius r for a cube-shaped nucleus, we first need to find the surface area A of a cube-shaped nucleus. The surface area of a cube is given by:

A = 6 * (side length)³

Since the side length of a cube is equal to its edge length, we have:

A = 6 * (edge length)³

Now, we can set up the equation for the critical Gibbs free energy change:

/Δ1G = 4πr²γls

Substituting the given value of γ and the surface area equation, we get:

/Δ1G = 4πr²γls = 4π(edge length)³γls

Solving for the critical edge length, we have:

edge length = (/Δ1G / (4πγls))¹(1/3)

Substituting the given value of /ΔGv = -2.8 * $10^8$ $J.m^(-3)$, we can calculate the critical Gibbs free energy change:

/Δ1G = -2.8 * $10^8$ $J.m^(-3)$ * 4πr³

1/√D = 1/r0 + (n/2) * ln(t/t0)

where:
- D is the diffusion coefficient
- r0 is the initial grain size
- t is the time
- t0 is a constant
- n is the Avrami exponent

Since we are dealing with liquid phase sintering, the Avrami exponent is typically around 2 for this process. However, we don't have the exact value of the diffusion coefficient or the time in this problem. Instead, we can use the following approximation based on the Bonding Energy Model:

r = (2 * ΔG / ΔH) * (1 / (1/r1^2 + 1/r2^2))

where:
- ΔG is the Gibbs free energy of grain boundary formation
- ΔH is the enthalpy of fusion of tungsten
- r1 and r2 are the radii of the grains

First, let's calculate the Gibbs free energy of grain boundary formation:

ΔG = γ * A

where:
- γ is the interfacial energy
- A is the area of the grain boundary

The area of the grain boundary can be calculated using the grain size and the neck size:

A = 4 * π * r * (r + r0)

Now, we can set up the equation:

r = (2 * ΔG / ΔH) * (1 / (1/r^2 + 1/r0^2))

4 * π * r * (r + r0) = γ * 4 * π * (r + r0)^2

Solving for r:

r = (γ / ΔH) * (1 + r0 / r)

Now, we can substitute the given values:

r = (γ / ΔH) * (1 + 40 µm / r)

We need to find γ, which can be calculated using the interfacial energies:

γ = 0.52 * (1 / (1/r1^2 + 1/r2^2)) + 0.30 * (1 / (1/r1^2 + 1/r2^2))

Since r1 = r2 = r (the neck size), we can simplify this expression:

γ = (0.52 + 0.30) * (1 / (1/r^2 + 1/r^2)) = 0.82 * (1 / (2/r^2)) = 0.41 * r^2

Now, we can substitute this value back into the equation for r:

r = (0.41 * r^2 / ΔH) * (1 + 40 µm / r)

Solving this quadratic equation numerically, we find that r ≈ 17.5 µm.

(4.58b) in the context provided, which includes the solid-liquid interfacial energy (γls). Therefore, if γls increases by 10%, the energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation will also increase.

To calculate the percentage change in the energy barrier, we can use the following formula:

Percentage change = [(New value - Old value) / Old value] × 100%

Let's denote the old energy barrier as ΔGhom, and the new energy barrier as ΔGhom_new. We know that:

ΔGhom = -4.3πr³/Δ1Gv + 4πr²γls

Now, let ΔGhom_new be the new energy barrier with the increased interfacial energy:

ΔGhom_new = -4.3πr³/Δ1Gv + 4πr²(1.10)γls

To find the percentage change, we can substitute the values and simplify:

Percentage change = [(ΔGhom_new - ΔGhom) / ΔGhom] × 100%

Percentage change = [(4πr²(1.10)γls - 4πr²γls) / (-4.3πr³/Δ1Gv + 4πr²γls)] × 100%

Percentage change = [(1.10 - 1) × 4πr²γls / (-4.3πr³/Δ1Gv + 4πr²γls)] × 100%

Since r and Δ1Gv are constants, we can simplify the expression:

Percentage change = [(0.1 × 4πr²γls) / (4πr²γls)] × 100%

Percentage change = 100% × 0.1

Percentage change = 10%

However, since the interfacial energy increase makes the energy barrier higher, the correct answer should be (B) 33% because the percentage change in the energy barrier is the same as the percentage change in the interfacial energy raised to the power of 3 (since the energy barrier is a function of the interfacial energy cubed).

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 33%.

Assuming that the metal droplet remains at its melting point of 900 K and neglecting radiative losses, the time(in seconds to one decimal place) to complete the solidification is?"," To calculate the time required for the spherical metal droplet to solidify, we can use the heat transfer equation for convective heat transfer and the energy balance equation for the solidifying droplet.

First, we need to calculate the surface area of the spherical droplet:

A = 4πr²
A = 4π(0.001 m)²
A = 0.00012566 m²

Next, we can calculate the heat transfer rate using the given convective heat transfer coefficient:

q = hA(Tm - To)
q = 200 W/m² * 0.00012566 m² * (900 K - 300 K)
q = 18.272 W

The energy balance equation for the solidifying droplet can be written as:

m⁢cₕ⁢dTₖₕdt = q

where m is the mass of the droplet, cₕ is the specific heat capacity, and Tₖ is the temperature of the droplet. Since the droplet is assumed to remain at its melting point during solidification, we can set Tₖ = Tm = 900 K.

The mass of the droplet can be calculated using its density and volume:

m = ρV
m = 2700 kg/m³ * (4/3)πr³
m = 0.0002653 kg

Substituting the values into the energy balance equation, we get:

m⁢cₕ⁢dTₖₕdt = q
0.0002653 kg * cₕ * dTₖ/dt = 18.272 W

Solving for dTₖ/dt, we get:

dTₖ/dt = q / (m * cₕ)
dTₖ/dt = 18.272 W / (0.0002653 kg * cₕ)

The specific heat capacity of the metal is typically given in units of J/kg K. To convert it to W/kg K, we need to multiply by 1 J/W.

cₕ = 4000 J/kg K * 1 J/W = 4000 W/kg K

Substituting the value of cₕ into the equation for dTₖ/dt, we get:

dTₖ/dt = 18.272 W / (0.0002653 kg * 4000 W/kg K)
dTₖ/dt = 0.0000453 s⁻¹

To find the time required for the droplet to solidify completely, we need to integrate dTₖ/dt over the entire solidification process. Since the solidification process is assumed to be isothermal (Tₖ = Tm), the integral simplifies to:

t = m⁢cₕ⁢(Tm - To) / q
t = 0.0002653 kg * 4000 W/kg K * (900 K - 300 K) / 18.272 W

$a_{Zn} = 0.078325 * 0.7$
$a_{Zn} = 0.054846$

Now, we can calculate the vapor pressure of Zn in the alloy using the activity:

$p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=0.7) = a_{Zn} * p_{Zn}^{id}(x_{Zn}=0.7)$

First, we need to find the vapor pressure of pure Zn at $x_{Zn} = 0.7$:

$p_{Zn}^{id}(x_{Zn}=0.7) = p_{Zn}^{id}(T=710K) * (0.7)$

We are given that $p_{Zn}^{id}(T=710K) = 3.6 * 10^{-4}$ atm.

$p_{Zn}^{id}(x_{Zn}=0.7) = 3.6 * 10^{-4} * 0.7 = 2.52 * 10^{-4}$ atm

Now, we can calculate the vapor pressure of Zn in the alloy:

$p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=0.7) = 0.054846 * 2.52 * 10^{-4}$
$p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=0.7) = 1.36 * 10^{-6}$ atm

Finally, we can calculate the ratio of vapor pressures:

${\frac{p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=0.7)}{p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=1)}} = {\frac{1.36 * 10^{-6}}{3.6 * 10^{-4}}}$

${\frac{p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=0.7)}{p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=1)}} = 0.3722$ (up to two decimal places)",,,0,

Pi = γi * xi * Pi°

where Pi is the partial pressure of zincub, xi is the mole fraction of zinc in the solution, and Pi° is the vapour pressure of pure zinc.

First, we need to convert the given vapour pressure of pure zinc from atm to torr:

Pi° = 0.027 atm * 1.316 * $10^(-3)$ atm/torr = 0.036 torr

Next, we can find the mole fraction of zinc in the solution:

xi = 0.03 mole % = 0.0003

Pi = 8.55 * 0.0003 * 0.036 torr = 0.00011 torr

The associated stored energy (in 𝑴𝑱. $𝒎^(−𝟑)$, rounded off to one decimal place) is","To calculate the stored energy, we can use the equation (9.8c) given by:

U = Uoθ[1 + ln(b2πro) - ln(θ)]

First, we need to find the value of Uo. Using the given values, we have:

Uo = τob2

where τ is the shear stress, and b is the Burgers vector. The shear stress is related to the shear modulus, G, by the equation:

τ = Gγ

where γ is the shear strain. For a simple cubic crystal, the shear strain for a dislocation with Burgers vector b = a/2[1 1 1] is given by equation (9.12b):

b = a√(u2 + v2 + w2)

where u, v, and w are the components of the Burgers vector in the Cartesian coordinate system. In this case, all components are equal to 1/2, so:

b = a√(12 + 12 + 12) = a√3

Now, we can find the shear strain, γ, using the equation (9.13b):

γθz = γzθ = b4πr

Substituting the values, we get:

γθz = (a√3)4π(0.2856 nm) = 0.119 nm−1

Now, we can find the shear stress, τ, using the given shear modulus, G:

τ = Gγθz = (82 GPa)(0.119 nm−1) = 9.63 GPa

Now, we can find Uo:

Uo = τob2 = (9.63 GPa)(0.2856 nm)2 = 0.0115 J/m

Next, we need to find the value of θ. We are given that the dislocation density increases from $10^(10)$ to $10^(15)𝑚^(−2)$. Using the equation (7.27), we have:

r : To + Øtl~bp !/2

where c~ is a constant at a given temperature, r0 for fcc metals is zero, and Ø is the dislocation density. Solving for Ø, we get:

Ø = (rTo + 1/2)2/c~

Substituting the given values, we get:

Ø = (($10^(15)𝑚^(−2)$)($10^(10)𝑚^(−2)$) + 1/2)2/0.5 = 2.4 × $10^(16)𝑚^(−2)$

Now, we can find the value of θ using the equation (9.8c):

θ = exp(-U/Uo)

Substituting the values, we get:

θ = exp(-(U/0.0115 J/m)) = 0.012

Now, we can find the stored energy, U:

U = Uoθ[1 + ln(b2πro) - ln(θ)]

(C) 4 hours. (D) 16 hours. "," The time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K can be calculated using the equation for one-dimensional heat conduction in a sphere:

T(r,t) = T\_i + (T\_o - T\_i) erf(r / (2√αt))

where T\_i is the initial temperature, T\_o is the final temperature, r is the radial distance, α is the thermal diffusivity, and t is time.

First, we need to find the thermal diffusivity of sphere X and sphere Y:

α\_X = 100*$10^(-6) m^2/s^(-1)
α\_Y = 25*$10^(-6) m^2/s^(-1)

Next, we can find the radius of sphere X and sphere Y:

r\_X = r\_Y (since they have identical diameters)

Now, we can set up the equation for sphere X and sphere Y:

800K = 1000K + (1000K - 800K) erf(r\_X / (2√α\_X * 3600s))

and

800K = 1000K + (1000K - 800K) erf(r\_X / (2√α\_Y * 3600s))

We can solve for the time (t) by isolating the erf term in each equation and setting them equal to each other:

erf(r\_X / (2√α\_X * 3600s)) = erf(r\_X / (2√α\_Y * 3600s))

Using the property of the error function that erf(x) = -erf(-x), we can rewrite the equation as:

erf(-r\_X / (2√α\_X * 3600s)) = -erf(-r\_X / (2√α\_Y * 3600s))

Taking the negative of both sides:

erf(r\_X / (2√α\_X * 3600s)) = erf(r\_X / (2√α\_Y * 3600s))

Now, we can use a calculator or a table of error functions to find the value of r\_X / (2√α\_X * 3600s) and r\_X / (2√α\_Y * 3600s) that satisfy this equation.

Using a calculator, we find that r\_X / (2√α\_X * 3600s) ≈ 1.212 and r\_X / (2√α\_Y * 3600s) ≈ 1.812.

Since r\_X is the same for both spheres, we can find the ratio of the time required for sphere Y to reach 800K compared to sphere X:

t\_Y / t\_X = (α\_X / α\_Y)

Substituting the values:

t\_Y / t\_X = (100*$10^(-6) m^2/s^(-1) / 25*$10^(-6) m^2/s^(-1))

t\_Y / t\_X = 4

Therefore, the time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K is 4 hours.

(A) 25 (B) 38 (C) 62 (D) 75","To find the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy Mg-50 wt.% Sn, we need to use the lever rule. The lever rule states that the mass ratio of the two phases in equilibrium is equal to the ratio of their compositions.

First, let's find the composition of $Mg_2Sn$ in terms of weight percent Sn. Since the atomic weight of Mg is 24.3 and Sn is 118.7, the mole fraction of Sn in $Mg_2Sn$ is:

$x_{Sn}^{Mg_2Sn} = \frac{2 \times 118.7}{2 \times 118.7 + 2 \times 24.3} = \frac{237.4}{496.6} = 0.477$

Now, we can find the weight percent Sn in $Mg_2Sn$:

$w_{Sn}^{Mg_2Sn} = x_{Sn}^{Mg_2Sn} \times 100\% = 0.477 \times 100\% = 47.7\%$

At the first eutectic temperature (561°C), the alloy composition is 36.9 wt.% Sn, and the phase in equilibrium is $Mg_2Sn$. Using the lever rule, we can find the mass ratio of $Mg_2Sn$ and the eutectic phase:

$\frac{m_{Mg_2Sn}}{m_{eutectic}} = \frac{w_{Sn}^{Mg_2Sn}}{w_{Sn}^{eutectic}} = \frac{47.7\%}{36.9\%} \approx 1.29$

Since the mass ratio of the phases in equilibrium is equal to the ratio of their compositions, we can find the mass ratio of the eutectic phase and the solid phase $\alpha$:

$\frac{m_{\alpha}}{m_{eutectic}} = \frac{1 - w_{Sn}^{eutectic}}{w_{Sn}^{eutectic}} = \frac{1 - 0.369}{0.369} \approx 2.73$

Now, we can find the mass ratio of the solid phase $\alpha$ and the eutectic constituent:

$\frac{m_{eutectic}}{m_{eutectic\ constituent}} = \frac{w_{Mg}^{eutectic}}{w_{Mg}^{Mg_2Sn}} = \frac{63.1\%}{50\%} = 1.262$

Multiplying the mass ratios, we find the mass ratio of the solid phase $\alpha$ and the eutectic constituent in the alloy:

$\frac{m_{\alpha}}{m_{eutectic\ constituent}} = \frac{m_{\alpha}}{m_{eutectic}} \times \frac{m_{eutectic}}{m_{eutectic\ constituent}} \approx 1.29 \times 1.262 \approx 1.62$

Now, we can find the weight percent of the eutectic constituent in the alloy:

$w_{eutectic\ constituent} = \frac{1}{1.62} \times 50\% \approx 31.0\%$

Finally, we can convert the weight percent to weight percent:

$w_{eutectic\ constituent} \approx 31.0\% \times \frac{100\%}{99.9\%} \approx 31.1\%$

So, the answer is approximately 31.1%, which is closest to option C (62%). However, the question asks for the approximate amount in wt.%, so the closest answer is option B (38%).

Explanation:

The assertion [a] states that low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often have additions of strong carbide-forming elements. This is true because the addition of carbide-forming elements helps in forming carbides, which act as precipitates and hinder the movement of dislocations, thereby increasing the creep resistance of the material.

The reason [r] given in the question states that during creep deformation, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix, lose coherency. This is also true because during creep deformation, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix experience higher stresses due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the particles and the matrix. This can lead to the formation of voids or cracks around the particles, which can act as nucleation sites for crack growth and reduce the creep strength of the material. However, the addition of carbide-forming elements helps in reducing the size and number of these particles, thereby improving the creep resistance of the material.

Explanation:

In a dilute solution, the activity of a solute (B) can be approximated by its mole fraction ($X_B$) using Henry's law. However, the mixing enthalpy ($ΔH_(mix)$) represents the heat released or absorbed when one mole of pure A and one mole of pure B are mixed at constant temperature and pressure.

When $ΔH_(mix)$ is positive, heat is released during the mixing process. This heat release results in a decrease in the entropy of the system, which in turn leads to a decrease in the activity of the solute (B) to maintain the overall entropy of the Gibbs free energy of the system remains constant.

Therefore, for a dilute solution of B in A, if the mixing enthalpy ($ΔH_(mix)$) is positive, the activity of B ($a_B$) will be less than its mole fraction ($X_B$).",,,0,

(D) Rate of reaction depends on temperature","(C) Half-life does not depend on the initial concentration and zero-order rate constant.

Explanation:

For a zeroth order chemical reaction, the rate of reaction is constant and does not depend on the concentration of the reacting species. Therefore, the concentration versus time plot is a straight line with a constant slope. The half-life, on the other hand, is the time required for the initial concentration to decrease to 50% of its initial value. Since the reaction rate is constant, the time it takes to reach this point does not depend on the initial concentration but only on the zero-order rate constant. Therefore, the statement in option (C) is FALSE.

Option (A) is TRUE because the concentration versus time plot is a straight line for a zeroth order reaction. Option (B) is TRUE because an increase in concentration of reacting species increases the rate of reaction for a zeroth order reaction.

The text also mentions that the tangent line intercepts the minimum Gibbs energy for the liquid and solid phases at points X4 and X5, respectively.

Based on this information, we can infer that the condition for getting the binary phase diagram of A-B with a miscibility gap is that the enthalpy of mixing for the solid phase is much less than zero (indicating strong attraction between the components), while the enthalpy of mixing for the liquid phase is zero (indicating ideal behavior).

Explanation:

The critical value of the Gibbs energy of nucleation at equilibrium temperature is a positive value. This is because the formation of a new phase involves the creation of an interface between the new phase and the initial parent matrix, which increases the energy of the system. Although the transition of the initially homogeneous parent phase to the new phase particle results in a decrease in chemical potential and thus the decrease in the Gibbs free energy of the particle, the creation of the interface increases the energy of the system. Since the Gibbs free energy reduction is proportional to the volume of the particle while the interfacial energy increase is proportional to the interfacial area, the interfacial energy increase dominates over the Gibbs free energy reduction when the particle size is very small, and the Gibbs free energy reduction dominates over the interfacial energy increase at large sizes. Therefore, there is a critical size for the nucleating particle, above which the total free energy, the Gibbs free energy and interfacial energy, decreases with size while below which increases with size.",,,0,

At 25°C: $C_{p,25}$ = 17.49 J/(mol.K)
At 700°C: $C_{p,700}$ = 17.49 + 24.77 * $10^(-3)*700$ = 17.49 + 24.77 = 42.26 J/(mol.K)

Now, we can integrate the specific heat capacity function with respect to temperature over the given temperature range:

$\Delta H = \int_{298.15}^{700} C_p dT$

$\Delta H = \int_{298.15}^{700} (17.49 + 24.77 * 10^{-3}*T) dT$

$\Delta H_{2} = \frac{24.77 * 10^{-3}}{2} * T^2$

Adding the two integrals:

$\Delta H = \Delta H_{1} + \Delta H_{2}$

$\Delta H = 17.49 * (T - 298.15) + \frac{24.77 * 10^{-3}}{2} * T^2$

Now, we can find the value of $\Delta H$ at 700°C:

$\Delta H(700) = 17.49 * (700 - 298.15) + \frac{24.77 * 10^{-3}}{2} * 700^2$

$\Delta H(700) = 17.49 * (401.85) + \frac{24.77 * 10^{-3}}{2} * 490000$

$\Delta H(700) = 401.85 * 17.49 + 490000 * \frac{24.77 * 10^{-3}}{2}$

$\Delta H(700) = 71113.35 + 118126.67$

$\Delta H(700) = 189239.02$ J/mol

The equilibrium ratio, $𝑝_(C0_2)$/ $𝑝_(CO)$ for the reaction at 1200 K and 1 atm is ?"," To find the equilibrium ratio of CO/CO2 for the given reaction at a specific temperature and pressure, we can use the equation:

ln(Kp) = ΔG°/RT

where Kp is the equilibrium constant, ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

First, we need to find the value of Kp for the given reaction at 1200 K using the standard Gibbs free energy change:

ΔG° = −8000 J/mol (for 1 mole of CO)

Since the reaction involves 3 moles of CO and 3 moles of CO2, the total change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction is:

ΔG° = −3 × 8000 J/mol = −24,000 J/mol

Now, we can calculate the value of Kp using the given equation:

ln(Kp) = ΔG°/RT
ln(Kp) = −24,000 J/mol / (8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$ × 1200 K)
ln(Kp) = −13.31

To find the equilibrium ratio of CO/CO2, we need to use the following equation:

Kp = (pCO2)3 / (pCO)³

Since both CO and CO2 are at 1 atm pressure, we have:

pCO = pCO2 = 1 atm

Therefore,

Kp = 1

Now, we can find the equilibrium ratio of CO/CO2 by using the value of Kp:

ln(Kp) = ln(1) = 0

Using the equation for Kp, we have:

ln(Kp) = ln[(pCO2)3 / (pCO)³] = 0

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

Kp = (pCO2)3 / (pCO)³ = 1

Since both CO and CO2 are at 1 atm pressure, we have:

(pCO2)3 / (pCO)³ = 1

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

pCO2 / pCO = 1

We are given that $∆G^(L→S) = -1000$ J $mol^(-1)$ when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1256 K. We can use this information to find $∆H^(L→S)$ and $∆S^(L→S)$.

First, let's find $∆H^(L→S)$. At the melting point (1356 K), $∆G^(L→S) = 0$ since the system is at equilibrium. Therefore, $∆H^(L→S) = T ∆S^(L→S)$ at the melting point. We can rearrange this equation to find $∆S^(L→S)$:

$∆S^(L→S) = ∆H^(L→S)/T$

Substituting the given value of $∆G^(L→S)$ and the melting point temperature (1356 K), we get:

$∆S^(L→S) = -1000$ J $mol^(-1)$ / (1356 K) = -0.000728 $J/K$ $mol^(-1)$

Now, we can find $∆H^(L→S)$ by using the given value of $∆S^(L→S)$ and the equation:

$∆G^(L→S) = ∆H^(L→S) - T ∆S^(L→S)$

Rearranging this equation, we get:

$∆H^(L→S) = T ∆S^(L→S) + ∆G^(L→S)$

Substituting the values, we get:

The rate of heat removal by the mould is given as 4.2 × $10^6$ W. The latent heat of fusion is given as 3 × $10^(5)$ J $kg^(-1)$. Therefore, the mass rate of solidification is:

ds/dt = Heat removal rate / Latent heat of fusion

Given that the activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution in Fe is $10^(-3)$, the standard Gibbs free energy change (in kJ) for this equilibrium is?"," To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for the equilibrium Si (liq.) = Si (1 wt.%), we need to use the following equation:

ΔG° = ΔG°r + ΔG°s

where ΔG°r is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction and ΔG°s is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the solution.

First, let's calculate ΔG°r using the given information. The reaction can be written as:

Si (s) → Si (liq.)

Since the standard state for Si is pure solid Si, we have:

ΔG°r = ΔG°f(Si (s)) - ΔG°f(Si (liq.))

Using the data from the context, we have:

ΔG°f(Si (s)) = 0 (by definition)

ΔG°f(Si (liq.)) = μ°(Si (liq.)) = μ°(Si) + RT ln a(Si)

where μ°(Si) is the standard chemical potential of pure liquid Si and a(Si) is the activity of Si in the solution.

Since the activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution is $10^(-3)$, the activity of Si at 1 wt.% is:

a(Si) = $10^(-3)$ × (1 + 0.01) = $1.001$ × $10^(-3)$

Using the given value of the activity coefficient at infinite dilution, we can calculate the activity of Si at 1 wt.%:

ln a(Si) = ln($1.001$) + ln($10^(-3)$) = -2.992

Therefore,

ΔG°f(Si (liq.)) = μ°(Si) + RT ln a(Si) = μ°(Si) - 2.992 RT

To find μ°(Si), we can use the fact that the change of standard state from pure liquid to 1 wt.% is equivalent to a change in the standard state from pure solid to a solution with a mole fraction of Si of 0.01. Therefore, we can use the following equation:

ΔG° = ΔG°r + ΔG°s = ΔG°(Si (s) → Si (0.01)) + ΔG°(Si (0.01) → Si (1 wt.%))

where ΔG°(Si (s) → Si (0.01)) is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the dissolution of Si from the solid to the solution at infinite dilution, and ΔG°(Si (0.01) → Si (1 wt.%)) is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the dissolution of Si from the solution at infinite dilution to the solution at 1 wt.%.

Using the given information, we have:

ΔG°(Si (s) → Si (0.01)) = ΔG°f(Si (s)) - ΔG°f(Si (0.01)) = ΔG°f(Si (s)) - ΔG°f(Si (liq.)) + ΔG°s(Si (liq.) → Si (0.01))

where ΔG°s(Si (liq.) → Si (0.01)) is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the dissolution of Si from the liquid to the solution at infinite dilution.

Since Si obeys Henry's law at infinite dilution, we have:

ΔG°s(Si (liq.) → Si (0.01)) = ΔG°r(Si (g) → Si (liq.)) = -RT ln(P(Si (g))/P°(Si (g)))

where P(Si (g)) is the partial pressure of Si in the gas above the liquid and P°(Si (g)) is the standard pressure.

The initial equilibrium condition is:

[N2 in steel] = H * [N2 in gas]

We can use the reaction 2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g) to find ΔH° and ΔS° for this reaction by using the given reactions and their corresponding ΔG° values and the fact that ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°.

First, we need to find ΔG° for the reaction 2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s). We can do this by using the reaction 2Cu(s) + 0.5$S\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) and the reaction 0.5$S\_2$(g) + $O\_2$(g) = $SO\_2$(g).

ΔG°(2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g)) = ΔG°(2Cu(s) + 0.5$S\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s)) + ΔG°(0.5$S\_2$(g) + $O\_2$(g) = $SO\_2$(g))

ΔG°(2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g)) = -100 kJ + 292 kJ = 192 kJ

Now, we can use the equation ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° to find ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction 2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g).

ΔH°(2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g)) = ΔG°(2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g)) + TΔS°(2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g))

ΔH°(2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g)) = 192 kJ + TΔS°(2Cu(s) + $SO\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s) + $O\_2$(g))

To find ΔS°, we need to find the entropy change for each reaction and then add them together.

ΔS°(2Cu(s) + 0.5$S\_2$(g) = $Cu\_2$S(s)) = ΔS°(2Cu(s) = $Cu\_2$S(s)) + ΔS°(0.5$S\_2$(g))

If the pressure(in bar) outside the bubble is 1.5 bar, the pressure inside the bubble  is? (round off to 1 decimal place). "," To find the pressure inside the bubble, we can use the Laplace equation, which relates the pressure difference across a curved surface to the surface tension and the radius of curvature:

Δp = 2γ/r

where Δp is the pressure difference, γ is the surface tension, and r is the radius of curvature.

First, we need to find the radius of the bubble. Since it is a spherical bubble, the radius is simply the given value of 0.01 mm.

Next, we can substitute the given values into the Laplace equation:

Δp = 2 × 1.4 × 10^-3 / 0.01 × 10^-3
Δp = 28.6 × 10^3 Pa

To find the pressure inside the bubble, we need to subtract the external pressure from the pressure difference:

$K_p = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}^2}$

We are given $Δ_rG°$ and $K_p$ at 1873 K, so we can find $p_{CO}$ and $p_{CO_2}$ using the following equations:

$Δ_rG° = Δ_rG°° + RT \ln K_p$

$Δ_rG°° = -RT \ln K_c$

where $K_c$ is the equilibrium constant in molar units.

First, we need to find $K_c$:

$K_c = \frac{a_{MoO_2}}{a_{Mo} \cdot a_{O_2}^{0.5}}$

Since $a_{MoO_2}$ is given as 0.5, and $a_{Mo}$ and $a_{O_2}$ are both equal to 1 in a gaseous state at 1 atm and 1873 K (since they are both elements), we have:

$K_c = 0.5$

Now, we can find $Δ_rG°°$:

$Δ_rG°° = -RT \ln K_c = -(8.314 \cdot 1873) \ln 0.5 = -120860 \text{ J}$

Next, we can find $Δ_rG°$:

$Δ_rG° = Δ_rG°° + RT \ln K_p$

We are given $Δ_rG°° = -262300 \text{ J}$, so:

$RT \ln K_p = 262300 \text{ J} - 120860 \text{ J} = 141440 \text{ J}$

$K_p = e^{\frac{141440 \text{ J}}{8.314 \cdot 1873 \text{ K}}} = 1.12 \cdot 10^5$

Now, we can find the equilibrium ($p_{CO}$/$p_{CO_2}$) ratio:

$p_{CO_2} = K_p \cdot p_{CO}^2$

$p_{CO_2} = 1.12 \cdot 10^5 \cdot p_{CO}^2$

$p_{CO} = \sqrt{\frac{p_{CO_2}}{1.12 \cdot 10^5}}$

$p_{CO} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.12 \cdot 10^5 \cdot p_{CO_2}}} = \frac{1}{1.06 \cdot 10^3 \cdot \sqrt{p_{CO_2}}}$

$p_{CO} = \frac{1}{1.06 \cdot 10^3 \cdot \sqrt{p_{CO_2}}} \cdot \frac{1}{p_{CO_2}}$

$p_{CO} = \frac{1}{1.06 \cdot 10^3 \cdot \sqrt{p_{CO_2}}} \cdot \frac{1}{p_{CO_2}} \cdot p_{CO_2}$

$p_{CO} = \frac{1}{1.06 \cdot 10^3}$

First, we need to find the activity coefficient of Au. We can use the following equation:

ln(γAu) = ln(1 + kxAg)

where k is the interaction parameter between Au and Ag and xAg is the mole fraction of Ag in the melt. Since the melt is assumed to be a regular solution, the interaction parameter can be calculated using the following equation:

k = (ΔHm mixing / RT)

where ΔHm mixing is the enthalpy of mixing. We can calculate ΔHm mixing using the given partial molar enthalpy of Au and the partial molar enthalpy of Ag, which can be assumed to be zero since Ag is the solvent.

ΔHm mixing = ΔHm Au + ΔHm Ag = -8300 J.mol^(-1) + 0 J.mol^(-1) = -8300 J.mol^(-1)

k = ΔHm mixing / (RT) = -8300 J.mol^(-1) / (8.314 J.$K^(-1).mol^(-1)$ * 1400 K) = -0.0311

Now, we can find the mole fraction of Ag in the melt:

xAg = 1 - XAu = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75

Using the equation for the activity coefficient, we get:

ln(γAu) = ln(1 + kxAg) = ln(1 + (-0.0311 * 0.75)) = -0.0451

Finally, we can find the activity of Au using the equation:

ln(aAu) = ln(γAu) + ln(XAu) = ln(-0.0451) + ln(0.25) = -0.4051 + 1.3979 = 0.9928

Therefore, the activity of Au in the Ag-Au melt containing 25 mol% Au at 1400 K is approximately 0.993 (rounded off to three decimal places).",,,0,

$M = \frac{PV}{nRT}$

where $P$ is the pressure at standard temperature and pressure ($1 atm = 1.01325*10^5 Pa$), $V$ is the molar volume, $n$ is the number of moles, and $R$ is the gas constant.

$C\_v = 3R/M = 3(8.314 J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1})/(31.52 g.mol^{-1}) = 0.132 J.K^{-1}.g^{-1}$

$C\_p = cs*M = 0.346 J.K^{-1}.g^{-1}(31.52 g.mol^{-1}) = 11.03 J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1}$

Now we can find the ratio of heat capacities:

Heat transfer rate, Q = h * A * ΔT
where h is the coefficient of convective heat transfer, A is the surface area of the tube, and ΔT is the temperature difference between the tube wall and the air.

The surface area of the tube, A = π * (outer diameter / 2) ^ 2

outer diameter = inner diameter + 2 * wall thickness

Given: inner diameter = 0.08 m, wall thickness = not given
Let's assume a reasonable value for the wall thickness, say 0.005 m.
outer diameter = 0.08 m + 2 * 0.005 m = 0.086 m

A = π * (0.086 m) ^ 2 = 0.00314 m^2

We know that in a bcc structure, the interplanar spacing for the (110) plane is given by:

d = a √(2)

Substituting the value of a:

d = 2.494 Å √(2) = 1.332 Å

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the 2θ angle:

2d sin θ = λ

We want to find sin θ, so we'll rearrange the equation:

sin θ = λ / (2d)

Substituting the values:

sin θ = 1.54 Å / (2 * 1.332 Å) = 0.461

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d for the (113) planes in a face centered cubic lattice. Using the given lattice parameter a = 0.392 nm, we can use the following equation:

d = a √(h² + k² + l²)

Substituting h = 1, k = 1, and l = 3, we get:

d = a √(1² + 1² + 3²) = a √(1 + 1 + 9) = a √11 = a √11 × √1 = a √11 × 1 = a √11

Since a = 0.392 nm, we have:

d = 0.392 nm × √11 ≈ 0.433 nm

Now we can use the Bragg equation to find the diffraction angle θ:

2 × 0.433 nm × sin θ = 1 × 0.1542 nm

Solving for sin θ, we get:

sin θ = 0.1542 nm / (2 × 0.433 nm) ≈ 0.0655

In an fcc crystal, the (100) plane contains atoms at the corners and the centers of the faces. Since there are 2 atoms at each corner and 1 atom at each face center, the number of atoms in the (100) plane is 2(number of corners) + 1(number of face centers). The area of the (100) plane is a^2, where a is the edge length of the cube. Therefore, the planar density is:

ρplane = (2(6) + 1) / a^2 = 7 / a^2

Substituting R = a / √2 (since the volume of an fcc unit cell is a^3 and it contains 4 atoms), we have:

So the answer is (B) 0.25/$R^2$.",,,0,
Atomic structure,11,G-XEC-2015-64-21,NUM,30,Calculate the density of copper in kg $m^(-3)$ given that copper has an fcc lattice with a lattice parameter of 0.365 nm. Copper has an atomic weight of 63.54 amu," To calculate the density of copper, we first need to find the mass of one unit cell and then divide it by the volume of the unit cell.

The mass of one unit cell can be calculated using the formula:

mass of one unit cell = (number of atoms in the unit cell) × (atomic mass of copper)

Since there are 4 atoms in the fcc unit cell, the mass of one unit cell is:

mass of one unit cell = 4 × (63.54 amu) = 254.16 amu

To convert the atomic mass to kg, we use the conversion factor:

1 amu = 1.660538863 × 10^-27 kg

So, the mass of one unit cell in kg is:

mass of one unit cell = 254.16 amu × 1.660538863 × 10^-27 kg/amu = 4.136 × 10^-25 kg

The volume of the unit cell is given by:

V = a³

where a is the lattice parameter. In this case, a = 0.365 nm = 0.365 × 10^-9 m

So, the volume of the unit cell is:

V = (0.365 × 10^-9 m)³ = 4.114 × 10^-29 m³

The density of copper is the mass of one unit cell divided by the volume of the unit cell:

density = mass of one unit cell / volume of the unit cell

density = 4.136 × 10^-25 kg / (4.114 × 10^-29 m³) = 9.82 × 10³ kg/m³

Therefore, the density of copper is approximately 9.82 × 10³ kg/m³ or 9820 kg/m³.",,,0,

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d using the lattice parameter a:

d = a

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the diffraction angle θ:

nλ = 2dsinθ
1.54 Å = 2dsinθ

To find the value of sinθ, we can use the inverse tangent function:

sinθ = λ / (2d)
sinθ = 1.54 Å / (2 * 4.1 Å)
sinθ ≈ 0.119

Now, we can find the value of θ using the inverse tangent function again:

Atomic structure,14,G-XEC-2016-22,NUM,14,The angle (in degrees) between [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is," The angle between [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is 45 degrees.

Explanation:

In a cubic system, the angle between two directions is given by the dot product of their direction cosines and the cosine of the angle between them. The direction cosines of [110] and [111] are (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2) and (1, 1, 1), respectively. The dot product of these vectors is 1/√2 + 1/√2 + 1/√2 = √2, and the cosine of 45 degrees is also √2/2. Therefore, the angle between [110] and [111] is 45 degrees.

Alternatively, you can use the fact that in a cubic system, the angle between two planes with Miller indices (h1, k1, l1) and (h2, k2, l2) is given by the formula:

cosθ = h1*h2 + k1*k2 + l1*l2 / (|h1|^2 + |k1|^2 + |l1|^2)^(1/2) * (|h2|^2 + |k2|^2 + |l2|^2)^(1/2)

Using this formula, you can calculate the angle between [110] and [111] by substituting their Miller indices:

h1 = 1, k1 = 1, l1 = 0
h2 = 1, k2 = 1, l2 = 1

Substituting these values, you get:

cosθ = (1*1 + 1*1 + 0*1) / (1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2)^(1/2) * (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)^(1/2) = √2/2 = cos(45 degrees)

Therefore, the angle between [110] and [111] is 45 degrees.",,,0,

Explanation: During the deformation of a semi-crystalline polymer with spherulitic morphology in tension, the amorphous regions elongate in the stress direction, while the crystallites experience bending and stretching of their chains. This behavior is due to the fact that the crystalline regions are more rigid than the amorphous regions, and the chains within the crystallites can slide past each other more easily, allowing for the bending and stretching to occur. Additionally, the amorphous regions are more mobile and can more easily align with the stress direction, leading to their elongation.",,,0,

Explanation:

(i) Polymers that are less coiled have more regular chain conformations, which can facilitate crystallization. Therefore, they are more likely to be crystalline than those that are more coiled.

(ii) Branched polymers have more complex structures than linear polymers, which can hinder the packing of chains and make crystallization more difficult. Therefore, they are less crystalline than linear polymers.

(iii) Polymers with inter-chain interactions have stronger intermolecular forces, which can increase the energy required for molecular rearrangements and raise the glass transition temperature.

(iv) However, inter-chain interactions can also promote crystallization by enhancing the intermolecular forces between chains and improving the chain alignment. Therefore, the relationship between inter-chain interactions and crystallinity is more complex than a simple correlation.

First, let's calculate the molecular weight of one repeat unit (Mr) of the ethylene unit:

Mr (ethylene) = (Number of carbon atoms + Number of hydrogen atoms) x Atomic weight
Mr (ethylene) = (2 x 12 + 2 x 1) g/mol = 28 g/mol

Now, we can calculate the molecular weight of the other repeat unit (Mr2) using the given information:

Mn = (xMr + yMr2) / (x + y)
10^5 = (x(28) + yMr2) / (x + y)

where x is the number of ethylene repeat units and y is the number of repeat units of the other monomer.

We also know that the degree of polymerization (n) is the sum of the number of repeat units of both monomers:

n = x + y
2210 = x + y

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

First, let's express y in terms of x:

y = 2210 - x

Now, substitute this expression into the first equation:

10^5 = (x(28) + (2210 - x)Mr2) / (x + (2210 - x))

We don't have enough information to calculate the exact value of Mr2, but we can find the possible values of Mr2 based on the given options.

Let's calculate the molecular weight of each option and check if they satisfy the given condition:

A) For $−CH_2−CH(CH_3)−$:
Mr (methyl) = 14.01 g/mol
Mr (ethyl) = 29.1 g/mol
Mn = (x(28) + y(29.1)) / (x + y)
2210 = (x(28) + (2210 - x)(29.1)) / (x + (2210 - x))

B) For $−CH_2−CHCl−$:
Mr (chloroethylene) = 66.5 g/mol
Mn = (x(28) + y(66.5)) / (x + y)
2210 = (x(28) + (2210 - x)(66.5)) / (x + (2210 - x))

C) For $−CF_2−CF_2−$:
Mr (fluoroethylene) = 28.1 g/mol

First, we need to find the area of the (110) plane. In a body centered cubic lattice, the (110) plane is a face-centered plane, meaning that every other atom lies on the plane. Since there are two atoms in the unit cell, one at each corner and one at the body center, only half of the atoms contribute to the (110) plane.

Area = (1/2) * (a^2 * sin(70.53)^2 + a^2 * cos(70.53)^2)

Substituting the value of sin(70.53) and cos(70.53) from a calculator, we get:

Area = (1/2) * (a^2 * 0.34202 + a^2 * 0.93569)
Area = (1/2) * 1.27769 * a^2

Now, we can find the number of atoms per unit area by dividing the total number of atoms in the unit cell by the area of the (110) plane:

Number of atoms per unit area = (Total number of atoms in the unit cell) / (Area of the (110) plane)

The total number of atoms in the unit cell of a body centered cubic lattice is 2 (at the corners) + 1 (at the body center) = 3 atoms.

NA = 8.48 * $10^28$ m⁻³

Now, we can calculate the concentration of vacancies:

cv = 8.48 * $10^28$ m⁻³ * cv

We don't have the exact value of co, but we can assume it to be a large number since the concentration of vacancies is expected to be very small at room temperature. Therefore, we can assume that cv is much smaller than NA.

Using a calculator, we find that:

cv ≈ 1.16 * $10^(-23}$)

So, the fraction of vacancies in pure copper at 27°C is:

x ≈ cv / NA ≈ 1.16 * $10^(-23$) / (8.48 * $10^28$ m⁻³) ≈ 1.35 * $10^(-19$)

However, the given value of x is $10^(-16)$, which is several orders of magnitude larger than our calculated value. This suggests that there is an error in the given information or the problem statement.",,,0,

Atomic structure,37,G-XEC-2018-20,NUM,35,X -ray diffraction pattern is obtained from FCC polycrystalline aluminium (lattice parameter = 0.405 nm) using Cr-Kα radiation of wavelength 0.229 nm. The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the pattern is ," To determine the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern of FCC polycrystalline aluminium, we can use the relationship between the number of Miller indices (hkl) and the number of unique reflections:

Number of unique reflections = (a/2)³

where a is the lattice parameter.

Given that the lattice parameter of aluminium is 0.405 nm, we have:

Number of unique reflections = (0.405 nm)³ / (2)³
                                           ≈ 12,916

However, not all of these reflections will be observable due to the symmetry of the FCC lattice. In an FCC lattice, there are certain planes that have the same spacing and therefore give rise to identical diffraction patterns. These are called the ""forbidden reflections.""

The number of observable reflections can be calculated using the following formula:

Number of observable reflections = (a/2)³ / P

where P is the point group symmetry of the FCC lattice, which is 432.

Number of observable reflections = (0.405 nm)³ / 432
                                              ≈ 1,440

Therefore, the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern of FCC polycrystalline aluminium using Cr-Kα radiation of wavelength 0.229 nm is approximately 1,440.",,,0,

(give answer up to 2 decimal places).," To calculate the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal, we first need to determine the area of the unit cell in the (110) plane.

The area of the (110) plane in a BCC crystal can be calculated using the lattice parameter a as follows:

Area = (a × √2)²

Substituting the given lattice parameter value, we get:

Area = (0.287 nm)² × √2²
Area = 0.115 nm²

Now, since there are two atoms in the BCC unit cell, the planar atomic density can be calculated as:

Planar atomic density = (Number of atoms / Area)

Since there are two atoms in the BCC unit cell, the planar atomic density is:

Planar atomic density = 2 / 0.115 nm²
Planar atomic density = 17.39 nm⁻² (approximately)

2d sin θ = nλ

where d is the interplanar spacing, θ is the Bragg angle, and n is the order of reflection.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing for the fourth reflection in an FCC lattice. The Miller indices for the fourth reflection in an FCC lattice are (222), so the interplanar spacing can be calculated using the lattice parameter:

d = a√(h² + k² + l²)
d = 3.5 Å√(2² + 2² + 2²)
d = 3.5 Å√12
d = 2.16 Å

sin(θ) = 0.6653
θ = sin⁻¹(0.6653)

(round off to 2 decimal places) "," To find the density of the austenite (Fe-10 atom % C) having a lattice parameter of 4 Å and no Fe vacancies, we first need to determine the number of atoms in the unit cell and then calculate the total mass and density.

1. Determine the number of atoms in the unit cell:
Since the lattice parameter is given, we can calculate the volume of the unit cell, V = a³ = (4 Å)³ = 64 Å³.
The FCC unit cell contains 4 atoms.

2. Calculate the total mass of the unit cell:
The total mass of the unit cell, m = 4(mₕFe × nₕFe + mₕC × nₕC), where mₕFe = 55.8 g/mol, mₕC = 12.0 g/mol, nₕFe = 1 (since there are no Fe vacancies), and nₕC = 10/100 × 4 = 0.4.

m = 4[(55.8 g/mol) × 1 + (12.0 g/mol) × 0.4] = 4[(55.8 g/mol) + (4.8 g/mol)] = 4(59.6 g/mol) = 238.4 g

(Round off to the nearest integer)," To find the number of oxygen vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K, we can use the equation for the equilibrium number of vacancies given by the Boltzmann factor:

$n/N = exp[-E_f/k_BT]$

where $n$ is the number of vacancies, $N$ is the total number of lattice sites, $E_f$ is the formation energy of a vacancy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

First, we need to find the energy in eV:

$E_f = 4 eV = 4 * 1.602 * 10^{-19} J = 6.408 * 10^{-19} J$

Next, we can calculate the number of vacancies using the given temperature:

$n/N = exp[-E_f/k_BT]$

$n/N = exp[-(6.408 * 10^{-19} J)/(8.62 * 10^{-5} eV/K * 1000 K)]$

$n/N = exp[-7.694 * 10^{-14}]$

$n/N = 4.55 * 10^{-7}$

Since $N = N_A * 6.02 * 10^{23}$, we can find the number of vacancies:

$n = n/N * N = 4.55 * 10^{-7} * 6.02 * 10^{23} = 2.74 * 10^{16}$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the number of oxygen vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K is approximately 2.74 * $10^{16}$. However, since vacancies come in integer numbers, we cannot have a fractional number of vacancies. Therefore, we cannot provide an exact integer answer for this problem.

Given: n = 1, λ = 0.154 nm, θ = 78°

First, we need to find d using Bragg's law:

sinθ = h/λ, where h is the Planck constant divided by 2π, and hkl are the Miller indices.

h = (1.0545718e-34 Js) / (2 * 3.14159265)
h = 1.0545718e-34 Js / (2 * 3.14159265)
h = 0.017453293 Js

h^2 = h^2_h + h^2_k + h^2_l

h^2_h = (h^2 - h^2_k - h^2_l) / h^2
h^2_h = (h^2 - (h^2_1^2 + h^2_1^2 + h^2_1^2) / h^2)
h^2_h = (h^2 - 3h^2_1 / h^2)

h^2_h = (0.017453293^2 - 3 * (1^2) / h^2)
h^2_h = 0.01731315 / h^2

d = 0.154 nm / (2 * sin(44.5°))
d = 0.154 nm / (2 * 0.64278764)
d = 0.2886 nm

a = d * √h^2_1^2 + k^2_1^2 + l^2_1^2
a = 0.2886 nm * √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)

Explanation:

A unit dislocation with Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0] can split into two partial dislocations. The Burgers vectors of these partial dislocations can be obtained by dissociation reactions. In this case, the reaction is of the screw type, and the partial dislocations are of the Shockley type. The Burgers vectors of the Shockley partials are given by a/6(hkl), where h, k, and l are Miller indices.

For the given Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0], the dissociation reaction is of the type AB ~ A~ + B~, where A and B are the partial dislocations. The Burgers vectors of A and B are given by a/6[hkl] and a/6[h'k'l'], respectively.

From the context, we know that the Burgers vector of the partial dislocation A is of the type Ay, and the Burgers vector of the partial dislocation B is of the type By. The Miller indices h and k for partial dislocation A are given by h = 2 and k = -1, and the Miller indices h' and k' for partial dislocation B are given by h' = 1 and k' = -2.

Therefore, the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations are (a/6)[2 -1 1] for A and (a/6)[1 -2 -1] for B.

Grain size of the material is approximately  (A) 45 µm (B) 35 µm (C) 4.5 µm (D) 3.5 µm," To find the grain size of the material, we can use the Hall-Petch equation (1.57a) given by:

r0 = ri + Ky d^(-0.5)

where r0 is the yield stress, ri is the lattice frictional stress, Ky is the Hall-Petch constant, and d is the grain size.

We are given ri = 100 MN/$m^2$ and Ky = 0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$. We need to find d.

First, we need to isolate d in the equation:

d = (r0 - ri)/(Ky) ^(0.5)

Now, we can substitute the given values:

d = [(r0 - 100 MN/$m^2$)/(0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$)] ^(0.5)

To find r0, we can use the given ASTM No. 6 grain size. According to ASTM standards, the grain size in micrometers is approximately equal to 1/√(number). So, ASTM No. 6 corresponds to a grain size of approximately 25.6 micrometers.

Now, we can find the yield stress r0:

r0 = ri + Ky d^(-0.5)
r0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$ (25.6 µm) ^(-0.5)

Using a calculator, we find:

r0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$ (0.0161) ^(-0.5)
r0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$ * 13.22
r0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 1.322 MN/$m^2$
r0 = 101.322 MN/$m^2$

Now, we can find the grain size:

d = (r0 - ri)/(Ky) ^(0.5)
d = (101.322 MN/$m^2$ - 100 MN/$m^2$)/(0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$)^(0.5)
d = (1.322 MN/$m^2$)/(0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$)^(0.5)
d = 1.322 MN/$m^2$ / 0.0126
d = 105.32 µm

Since the grain size is given in ASTM numbers, we need to convert this value to ASTM No.:

Grain size = 1/√(number)
Number = 1/(grain size) ^2

Number = 1/(105.32) ^2
Number = 0.0000955
Number = 955

So, the grain size corresponds to ASTM No. 9 or 9.5. However, since ASTM No. 6 is the closest given option, the answer is (B) 35 µm.

According to the Bragg equation, the relationship between the interplanar spacing (dhkl) and the Miller indices (hkl) is given by dhkl = 2π / |ghkl|, where ghkl is the reciprocal lattice vector.

For the first peak, the Miller indices are (111), and for the second peak, they are (200). The reciprocal lattice vectors for these planes can be calculated as follows:

For (111) plane: g111 = (2π/a)(1, 1, 1)

For (200) plane: g200 = (2π/a)(2, 0, 0)

The ratio of the interplanar spacings is therefore:

dh111 / dh200 = |g111| / |g200| = (1, 1, 1) / (2, 0, 0) = 1/2

Since the interplanar spacing is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector, the ratio of the interplanar spacings is the reciprocal of the ratio of the magnitudes of the reciprocal lattice vectors. Therefore, the ratio of the interplanar spacings is 1/1 = 1.

Since the atomic diameter of an iron atom is 0.25 nm, the lattice parameter a is approximately equal to 0.25 nm. Therefore, the modulus of the Burgers vector is:

b = a√(u² + v² + w²)
b = (0.25 nm)√(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the components of the Burgers vector in the crystal lattice. Since an edge dislocation lies in the xy-plane and its Burgers vector is perpendicular to the dislocation line, the Burgers vector components are (h, k, l) = (0, √2a, 0).

b = a√(0² + (√2a)² + 0²)
b = a√(a² + 2a²)

b = a√3

Explanation:

In a simple cubic crystal, the planes with the highest Miller indices that can be observed in the first few peaks of the X-Ray powder pattern are those with the Miller indices (110). The reason for this is that the Miller indices (hkl) of a plane are related to the interplanar spacing (dhkl) through the Bragg equation, which states that the angle of incidence of the X-rays (2θ) is related to the interplanar spacing (dhkl) and the wavelength of the X-rays (λ) by the equation sin(θ) = λ / (2 * dhkl).

Since the interplanar spacing (dhkl) for the (110) planes is the largest among the first few sets of planes in a simple cubic crystal, the corresponding angle of incidence (2θ) will be the smallest angle at which X-rays can be diffracted from the crystal, resulting in the second peak in the powder pattern.

Explanation:

A. Buckling is a shape problem that occurs during rolling of relatively thick flat stocks, where the residual tension in the centre caused by the elongated edges could produce short 'zipper breaks' or cracks in the centre of the rolled product.

B. Edge cracking is a typical rolling defect that occurs due to the development of secondary tensile stresses at the edges caused by the barrelling of edges. This can be prevented or minimized by keeping the edges straight using vertical edge rolls, edge-restraining bars, or machining after each pass.

C. Cold shut is a surface defect that appears as a sharp, elongated surface discontinuity and is related to the flow of material, which is affected by the workability of the material, the details of part and die design. It is produced by folding over of some excess material from prior forging steps at the surface of forging or folding of material back onto its own surface during its flow in a partly filled-up die cavity.

Atomic structure,64,G-META-15-53,NUM,28,"In an FCC crystal, the strain energy per unit length of a dislocation with Burgers vector (𝑎/2)〈110〉 is x times that of a 𝑎/6 〈112〉 dislocation. Find x"," To find the value of x, we need to compare the elastic energy per unit length of a (𝑎/2)〈110〉 dislocation with that of a (𝑎/6)〈112〉 dislocation in an FCC crystal.

First, let's find the Burgers vectors in terms of lattice parameters. In an FCC crystal, the Burgers vector for a screw dislocation is given by equation (9.12c) as 𝑏 = 𝑎/2[111], and for an edge dislocation, it is given by equation (9.12d) as 𝑏 = 𝑎/2√(1+u²+v²), where u and v are the components of the dislocation line direction. For a 𝑎/6 〈112〉 dislocation, the Burgers vector is (𝑎/6)〈112〉 = (𝑎/6)[121].

Now, let's calculate the elastic energy per unit length for both dislocations using equations (9.16a) and (9.16b). For a screw dislocation, the energy per unit length is given by equation (9.16a) as dUs = Gb²4πdr, and for an edge dislocation, the energy per unit length is given by equation (9.16b) as dUe = Gb²4π(1−υ)dr.

Since the elastic energy per unit length is proportional to the square of the Burgers vector, we have:

dUs_screw = G(𝑎/2)²4πdr
dUe_edge = G(𝑎/2√(1+u²+v²))²4π(1−υ)dr

To find the value of x, we need to set dUs_screw = x * dUe_edge:

G(𝑎/2)²4πdr = x * G(𝑎/2√(1+u²+v²))²4π(1−υ)dr

Now, we need to find the value of u and v for a 𝑎/6 〈112〉 dislocation. Since the Burgers vector is (𝑎/6)〈112〉, the dislocation line direction is [112]. Therefore, u = 1 and v = √2.

Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

G(𝑎/2)²4πdr = x * G(𝑎/2√(1+1+√2)²)²4π(1−υ)dr

Simplifying the equation, we get:

G(𝑎/2)²4πdr = x * G(𝑎/2√3)²4π(1−υ)dr

Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can compare the square of the Burgers vectors:

(𝑎/2)² = (𝑎/2√3)²

Solving for x, we get:

x = (√3)² = 3

Therefore, the strain energy per unit length of a (𝑎/2)〈110〉 dislocation is three times that of a (𝑎/6)〈112〉 dislocation in an FCC crystal.",,,0,

Density = (Mass of the unit cell) / (Volume of the unit cell)

First, let's calculate the mass of the unit cell:

Mass of the unit cell = Density × Volume of the unit cell

Given, Density = 19000 kg.$m^(-3)$
Lattice parameter (edge length) = 0.4 nm = 0.4 × 10^-9 m

Volume of the unit cell = (Edge length)³
Volume of the unit cell = (0.4 × 10^-9 m)³ = 6.4 × 10^-27 m³

Now, calculate the mass of the unit cell:

Mass of the unit cell = 19000 kg.$m^(-3)$ × 6.4 × 10^-27 m³ = 1.2176 × 10^-22 kg

Next, we need to find the mass of one atom of the metal. Given, Atomic weight = 183 g/mol = 183 × 10^-3 kg/atom

Now, we can find the number of atoms in the unit cell:

Number of atoms = Mass of the unit cell / Mass of one atom

Number of atoms = 1.2176 × 10^-22 kg / 183 × 10^-3 kg/atom = 6.65 × 10^-26 atoms/unit cell

However, since we cannot have a fraction of an atom in the unit cell, we need to find the effective number of atoms in the unit cell. Since the metal has a cubic structure and each unit cell contains one atom at each corner and one atom at the center, the effective number of atoms in the unit cell is 8 (corners) + 1 (center) = 9 atoms.

The assertion [A] that a reduction in grain size results in a significant increase in creep rate for a material exhibiting Coble creep is correct. However, the reason [R] given that grain boundaries act as a barrier to motion of dislocations is not the only reason for this increase in creep rate.

The correct reason for the increase in creep rate with decreasing grain size in Coble creep is that there are more grain boundaries per unit volume in a fine-grained material, which increases the area available for grain boundary diffusion and vacancy flow. This results in a higher creep rate due to the increased rate of vacancy diffusion along the grain boundaries.

In this case, we are given the first peak occurs at 2θ = 68.7°, and the lattice parameter of iron is 0.287 nm. We need to find the interplanar spacing d and then use it to calculate the wavelength λ.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d using the lattice parameter a:

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the first peak. Since we don't have this information, we cannot directly calculate the interplanar spacing. However, we can use the Bragg equation to find the relationship between the wavelength and the interplanar spacing:

nλ = 2d sin θ

d = nλ / (2 sin θ)

We don't have the order of reflection n, but we can assume it to be 1 for the first peak. So,

d = λ / (2 sin θ)

d = λ / (2 sin 68.7°)

Explanation:

The assertion [a] is that the rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution of B in A is controlled by the diffusivity of B. This statement is generally true.

However, the reason [r] given is that ""Atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries."" This statement is not the correct reason for why the diffusivity of B controls the rate of homogenization.

The correct reason is that in a dilute substitutional solid solution, the diffusing atoms (B) are predominantly located in substitutional sites in the host lattice (A). Therefore, the rate of diffusion of B is controlled by the diffusivity of B in the host lattice. This is a fundamental principle of diffusion in solid solutions and is not dependent on the presence or absence of dislocations or grain boundaries.

Dislocations and grain boundaries can indeed act as barriers to diffusion, but they do not prevent diffusion from occurring altogether. In fact, diffusion along grain boundaries and through dislocations can be significant in certain regimes, particularly at higher temperatures or in the presence of high concentrations of solute atoms.

Therefore, while both the assertion and the reason may be true, the reason given is not the correct explanation for why the diffusivity of B controls the rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution.",,,0,

The percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is expected to be?(round off to nearest integer) ," To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm, we can use the given probability and the properties of the normal distribution.

First, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the given probability:

P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98

Using the normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the z-score for a probability of 0.98 is approximately 1.32.

Now, we can find the range of grain sizes corresponding to this z-score:

µ + 2σ - µ = 2σ

Substituting the given values:

2σ = 1.0 µm

To find the range of grain sizes, we can use the z-score and the standard deviation:

X ≤ µ + zσ

X ≤ 5 µm + 1.32(0.5 µm)

X ≤ 5.66 µm

So, approximately 98% of the specimens have a grain size less than or equal to 5.66 µm. To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm, we can subtract the percentage of specimens with grain size less than 5 µm from the total percentage:

Total percentage = 100%

Percentage with X < 5 µm = P(X < 5 µm)

Using a normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the z-score for a probability of 0.5 (50%) is approximately 0.0. So, the percentage of specimens with grain size less than 5 µm is approximately 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is approximately:

Explanation:
The sequence of peaks in an X-ray diffractogram of a pure copper powder sample can be determined by using the Bragg's law, which relates the interplanar spacing (d-spacing) to the diffraction angle (2θ). The Miller indices (hkl) of the planes can be determined by using the equation sinθ = hλ/2d, where λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, and θ is the diffraction angle.

For copper, the wavelength of the Cu Kα radiation is 0.15418 nm. The lattice parameters of copper are a = b = c = 0.3567 nm, and the angle between the sides of the unit cell is 90 degrees.

Using the Bragg's law, we can calculate the d-spacings for the different planes in the copper crystal structure. The planes with the smallest interplanar spacing will give rise to the strongest peaks in the diffractogram.

The planes with the smallest interplanar spacing in the copper crystal structure are the (111) planes, which have a d-spacing of 0.203 nm. The next planes in order of increasing d-spacing are the (200) planes, with a d-spacing of 0.154 nm, the (220) planes, with a d-spacing of 0.139 nm, and the (311) planes, with a d-spacing of 0.128 nm.

Therefore, the sequence of peaks in the X-ray diffractogram of a pure copper powder sample, in order of increasing 2θ, is 111, 200, 220, 311.",,,0,

On which plane do these two partial dislocaitons lie?  (A) (-1 1 1) (B) (1 1 1) (C) (1 -1 1) (D) (1 1 -1)," The given equation represents the dissociation of a dislocation with Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0] into two Shockley partial dislocations in an FCC metal. The Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations are (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1].

To determine on which plane these partial dislocations lie, we need to find the planes where the given Burgers vectors are normal to the plane. The normal vectors for the (hkl) planes in an FCC lattice are given by the equation [hkl] = (h, k, l) / sqrt(h² + k² + l²).

Let's calculate the normal vectors for the given Burgers vectors:

1. For (a/6)[2 -1 1]:
   Normal vector = (2, -1, 1) / sqrt(2² + (-1)² + 1²)
   = (2, -1, 1) / sqrt(4 + 1)
   = (2, -1, 1) / sqrt(5)

2. For (a/6)[1 -2 -1]:
   Normal vector = (1, -2, -1) / sqrt(1² + (-2)² + (-1)²)
   = (1, -2, -1) / sqrt(1 + 4 + 1)
   = (1, -2, -1) / sqrt(6)

Now, let's compare these normal vectors with the normal vectors of the (hkl) planes in the FCC lattice:

1. (111) plane: Normal vector = (1, 1, 1) / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = (1, 1, 1) / sqrt(3)
2. (-111) plane: Normal vector = (-1, -1, -1) / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = (-1, -1, -1) / sqrt(3)
3. (211) plane: Normal vector = (2, 1, 1) / sqrt(2² + 1² + 1²) = (2, 1, 1) / sqrt(3)
4. (-211) plane: Normal vector = (-2, -1, -1) / sqrt(2² + 1² + 1²) = (-2, -1, -1) / sqrt(3)
5. (121) plane: Normal vector = (1, 2, 1) / sqrt(1² + 2² + 1²) = (1, 2, 1) / sqrt(3)
6. (-121) plane: Normal vector = (-1, -2, -1) / sqrt(1² + 2² + 1²) = (-1, -2, -1) / sqrt(3)

8. (-1-21) plane: Normal vector = (-1, 2, -1) / sqrt(1² + 2² + (-1)²) = (-1, 2, -1) / sqrt(6)

$2d\ sin\theta = n\lambda$

where $d$ is the interplanar spacing, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the X-rays, $n$ is the order of reflection, and $\theta$ is the Bragg angle.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing $d$. In a FCC lattice, the second peak in the powder diffraction pattern corresponds to the (220) planes. The formula for the interplanar spacing in a FCC lattice is:

$d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$

where $a$ is the lattice parameter. Substituting the given values, we have:

$d = \frac{0.36}{\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2}} = \frac{0.36}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{0.36}{2} = 0.18nm$

Now we can use Bragg's law to find the Bragg angle:

$2\times0.18\ sin\theta = 2\times1\times0.154$

$sin\theta = \frac{0.154}{0.18} = 0.8611$

$\theta = sin^{-1}(0.8611) = 58.11^\circ$

The number of atoms per unit area($nm^(-2)$) in (100) plane of Pb is?(round off to the nearest integer)."," To find the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb, we first need to determine the area of the unit cell in the (100) plane. In an FCC lattice, the (100) plane contains atoms only at the corners, so the area of the unit cell in this plane is simply the area of one face of the cube.

The length of the edge of the cube in an FCC lattice is given by $a = 2R\sqrt{2}$, where $R$ is the atomic radius. Substituting the given value of $R$ for Pb, we have $a = 2\times 0.175\text{ nm}\sqrt{2} \approx 0.413\text{ nm}$.

The area of one face of the cube is $A = a^2 = (0.413\text{ nm})^2 \approx 0.171\text{ nm}^2$.

Since there is one atom at each corner of the unit cell in the (100) plane, the number of atoms per unit area is simply the reciprocal of the area of the unit cell, which is $\frac{1}{A} \approx \frac{1}{0.171\text{ nm}^2} \approx 5.85\times 10^{14}\text{ atoms}/\text{nm}^2$.

λ = 2dsinθ

We are given the Bragg angle for the first reflection (θ = 30°) and the lattice parameter (a) for the FCC crystal. We can find the interplanar spacing (d) using the following equation:

d = a√(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the first reflection (hkl = 111).

First, let's find the lattice parameter (a) for the FCC crystal. Since we know that the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle of 30°, we can use the following equation:

sinθ = h/λ

We are given θ = 30° and λ = 0.15418 nm.

sin30° = h/0.15418 nm
h = sin30° × 0.15418 nm
h ≈ 0.173 nm

Since h = 1, k = 1, and l = 1 for the first reflection, we have:

a = d/(√1² + 1² + 1²)
a = d/√3

Now, we can find the interplanar spacing (d) for the second reflection by finding the next set of Miller indices (hkl) that satisfy Bragg's law. Let's assume that the second reflection occurs for the (222) planes.

sinθ = h/λ

We are given θ = 30° + Δθ, where Δθ is the change in angle from the first reflection. We are also given λ = 0.15418 nm.

sin(30° + Δθ) = h/λ

We need to find h for the (222) planes.

h² = h₁² + h₂² + h₃²
h² = (2)² + (2)² + (2)²
h² = 9
h = √9 = 3

Now, we can find the change in angle (Δθ) using the following equation:

sinΔθ = |h/λ - sinθ|

μ(VA−AA) = μo(VA−AA) + kBTln(nv/N)

Since the vacancy concentration doubles upon increasing the temperature, the ratio of the new vacancy concentration to the old vacancy concentration is 2. We can set up the equation as follows:

μ(VA−AA)2 = μo(VA−AA) + kBTln(2)

We can rearrange this equation to find the change in chemical potential (Δμ) and then convert it to enthalpy using the equation: ΔH = -Δμ × T

Δμ = μ(VA−AA)2 - μo(VA−AA) = kBTln(2)

(A) Fine grain size (B) FCC crystal structure (C) High melting point (D) Cold worked microstructure "," C) High melting point
B) FCC crystal structure (with low stacking fault energy)

Explanation:

For high temperature applications, creep resistance is a crucial property. The following characteristics are desirable for achieving better creep resistance:

1. High melting point: A higher melting point makes the material more resistant to creep deformation because the recovery process by climbing of edge dislocations becomes more difficult, leading to higher resistance to creep. Recovery by climbing cannot occur significantly at homologous temperatures below about 0.5.

2. FCC crystal structure (with low stacking fault energy): Metals with low stacking fault energy have greater creep resistance because the perfect dislocations are dissociated into partial dislocations, making it more difficult to overcome obstacles by cutting through, cross-slipping, or climbing. The lower the stacking fault energy, the higher the separation between partial dislocations, i.e., the width of dissociated dislocations, and the more difficult it is to overcome the obstacles. FCC metals having close-packed structures also result in lower diffusivities that limit creep deformation, making their creep resistance superior to BCC metals at equivalent homologous temperatures.

Therefore, options B and C are the correct answers. Fine grain size is desirable for better strength, hardness, and toughness in low-temperature applications, but it can lead to higher creep rates due to the increased number of high-angle grain boundaries and the rapid vacancy diffusion. Cold worked microstructure is not desirable for creep resistance because it can easily recrystallize at high temperatures, leading to a loss of strength.",,,0,

Ygb = EoO[A - In 0] (4.11)

where Eo = r v), A = ln(b/ro), and b is the Burgers vector of the dislocation. For a tilt boundary, the Burgers vector is given by:

b = hkγ, where h is the lattice parameter, k is the number of Burgers vectors in the tilt boundary, and γ is the tilt angle in radians.

First, we need to find the tilt angle in radians. We are given the tilt angle in degrees, so we need to convert it to radians:

γ = 2° = 0.0349 radians

Next, we need to find the number of Burgers vectors in the tilt boundary. Since the misorientation angle is 2°, this is a small-angle tilt boundary, and we can approximate it as a single dislocation. Therefore, k = 1.

Now we can calculate the energy of the tilt boundary using the Read-Shockley formula:

Ygb = EoO[A - In 0]

where Eo = r v) = (1 - v)Gb2, A = ln(b/ro), and G is the shear modulus of aluminium, which is 28 GPa.

First, we need to find the lattice parameter in SI units:

h = 0.143 nm = 0.143 x 10-9 m

Next, we can calculate the Burgers vector in SI units:

b = hkγ = 0.143 x 10-9 m x 1 x 0.0349 radians = 4.85 x 10-11 m

Now we can calculate the energy of the tilt boundary:

Ygb = (1 - 0.33) x 28 GPa x (ln(b/ro) - In 0)

where ro is the radius of an aluminium atom, which is approximately 0.125 nm = 0.125 x 10-9 m.

Ygb = (1 - 0.33) x 28 x 109 Pa x (ln(4.85 x 10-11 m / 0.125 x 10-9 m) - In 0)

Ygb = 1.12 x 10-3 J/m2

Now we can use the Read-Shockley formula to find the spacing between the dislocations:

b/h = tan(γ/2) = tan(0.01745 radians) = 0.0173

The number of dislocations per unit length is given by:

n = 1 / (b/h) = 1 / 0.0173 = 57.8 x 1011 m-1

The spacing between the dislocations is the reciprocal of the number of dislocations per unit length:

h = 1 / (n x b) = 1 / (57.8 x 1011 m-1 x 4.85 x 10-11 m) = 0.0225 nm

First, let's calculate the elastic strain in the steel bar:

ε_steel = F / (EA_steel)
where F = 20 kN, EA_steel = E_steel * A_steel = 200 GPa * 8 cm^2 = 1600 GPa*cm^2

ε_steel = 20 kN / 1600 GPa*cm^2 = 0.0125

Now, we know that the aluminum bar experiences the same elastic strain as the steel bar. So, we can set the elastic strains equal to each other:

ε_Al = ε_steel = 0.0125

Now, we can calculate the elastic strain in the aluminum bar:

ε_Al = F / (EA_Al)

We don't know the cross-sectional area of the aluminum bar (A_Al), so we need to solve for it:

0.0125 = F / (EA_Al)

A_Al = 20 kN / (0.0125 * E_Al)

Substituting the given value of Young's modulus for aluminum:

A_Al = 20 kN / (0.0125 * 70 GPa)

Calculating the area:

A_Al = 20 kN / (0.0125 * 70 * 10^9 Pa)

A_Al = 11.43 cm^2

Explanation:

Young's modulus is a measure of the elastic properties of a material and does not depend on the mobile dislocation density. It is determined by the interatomic bonding between atoms in a material.

Ductility, on the other hand, is the ability of a material to deform without breaking. It is influenced by the mobile dislocation density because dislocations facilitate plastic deformation, which allows a material to deform without breaking.

Fracture toughness is the ability of a material to resist crack propagation. It is influenced by the mobile dislocation density because dislocations can interact with cracks and affect their growth behavior.

However, yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. It is directly related to the mobile dislocation density because the density of mobile dislocations determines the ease with which a material can deform. Therefore, yield strength is a property that depends on the mobile dislocation density.

When the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm, the expected yield strength(MPa) is ? "," To find the expected yield strength when the grain size is reduced to 16 μm, we can use the Hall-Petch equation:

Yield strength = Yield strength at infinite grain size (ri) + Kd

where K is the grain boundary strengthening constant and d is the grain diameter.

First, we need to find the value of K for this ferritic steel. From the context, we know that the Hall-Petch constant for copper is 12.6 N/mm3/2, which is equivalent to 12.6 × 10^3 MPa m^-1/2. Since the grain size is given in micrometers, we need to convert it to meters:

d = 16 μm = 16 × 10^-6 m

Now we can calculate the expected yield strength:

Yield strength = ri + Kd

We don't have the value of ri for this steel, but we can use the given data to find it. We know that the yield strength increases from 120 MPa to 150 MPa when the grain size decreases from 256 μm to 64 μm. We can assume that the yield strength at infinite grain size (ri) is the same for both grain sizes, so we can find the difference in yield strength and divide it by the difference in grain size:

ΔYield strength = 150 MPa - 120 MPa = 30 MPa

Δd = 64 μm - 256 μm = -212 μm = -0.0212 m

Now we can find ri:

ri = 120 MPa + 30 MPa = 150 MPa

Now we can calculate the expected yield strength:

Yield strength = 150 MPa + K(16 × 10^-6 m)

We don't have the value of K for this steel, but we can use the given data to estimate it. The Hall-Petch constant for copper is 12.6 × 10^3 MPa m^-1/2, which is equivalent to 12.6 × 10^3 MPa m^-1. We can assume that the grain boundary strengthening constant for this steel is similar to copper, so we can estimate K as:

K = 12.6 × 10^3 MPa m^-1

Now we can calculate the expected yield strength:

Yield strength = 150 MPa + 12.6 × 10^3 MPa m^-1 × 16 × 10^-6 m

These defects act as stress concentrators and can initiate cracks, leading to failure at much lower stresses than the theoretical strength. The other options (A) and (B) are not correct because ceramics do not have dislocations that can move at room temperature, and their high elastic modulus is not directly related to their lower than expected strength.

What is the relaxation time constant for this material?"," To find the relaxation time constant, we can use the given stress-strain relationship and the fact that the strain is constant. We know that the stress decreases from 10 MPa to 5 MPa after 40 days, so we can set up an equation to solve for the relaxation time constant.

First, we need to find the initial stress and strain values:

Initial stress (σ0) = 10 MPa
Initial strain (ε0) = 50% = 0.5

We can write the stress-strain relationship as:

σ = Eε

The resilience in tension, UR, for rubber is given by the area under the unloading stress-strain curve, which is less than the area under the loading curve due to hysteresis.

First, we need to find the initial stress, rA, and the strain, e, at the given stress and temperature. From the text, we know that the strain is 50%, so e = 0.5. The initial stress, rA, can be found from Hooke's law, which states that the stress is directly proportional to the strain. Therefore, rA = Ee = 50% * Young's modulus = 50% * E.

Next, we can use the stress-strain relationship to find the stress after 40 days, which is 5 MPa. We can set up the equation as follows:

ε = σE + [B1 + B2t + B3(1 − e−βt)]

The mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material in MJ/$m^3$ is," To calculate the mechanical energy required to break the material, we can use the equation:

Mechanical energy = Work done = Integral of stress-strain curve from 0 to total strain

Since the alloy does not exhibit any strain hardening, the stress is constant at the yield strength of 880 MPa. The total strain is given as 0.108.

First, we need to convert the total strain to engineering strain:

Engineering strain = ln(1 + total strain) = ln(1 + 0.108) = 0.1095

Now, we can calculate the work done:

Work done = Integral from 0 to 0.1095 of 880 MPa * 0.001 m^3/MPa * dε

Using the given equation for work done, we have:

Work done = ∫ from 0 to 0.1095 of 880 MPa * 0.001 m^3/MPa * dε

To solve this integral, we need to find the relationship between strain and engineering strain:

ε = ln(1 + engineering strain)

Differentiating both sides with respect to engineering strain, we get:

dε/d(ln(1 + engineering strain)) = dε/dε * dε/d(ln(1 + engineering strain))

Using the chain rule, we have:

dε/d(ln(1 + engineering strain)) = 1 / (1 + engineering strain)

Work done = ∫ from 0 to 0.1095 of 880 MPa * 0.001 m^3/MPa * (1 / (1 + engineering strain)) d(ln(1 + engineering strain))

σ = KIC / √(a)

Substituting the calculated value of KIC and the given value of a, we have:

σ = (300 MPa * √(30 μm)) / √(90 μm)

To simplify the calculation, we can assume that the fracture toughness is a constant value for this material and use the given value of KIC = 300 MPa * √(30 μm) = 12.6 MPa√m. Then, we can calculate the fracture stress for a critical flaw size of 90 μm as follows:

σ = 12.6 MPa√m / √(90 μm)

(round off to the nearest integer)," To find the stress required to change the polarization from 640 to 645 C m $-m^(-3)$, we need to use the relationship between the piezoelectric constant, Young's modulus, and the change in polarization.

First, we need to find the piezoelectric constant, which is related to the given Young's modulus by the equation:

$e_{31} = \sqrt{\frac{d_{31}^2}{c_{33} - c_{13}}}$

where $d_{31}$ is the piezoelectric constant and $c_{33}$ and $c_{13}$ are the elastic constants.

We are given $c_{33} = 72$ GPa, so we need to find $c_{13}$. We can use the fact that the elastic constants are related by the equation:

$c_{ij} = \lambda \delta_{ij} + \mu (\delta_{ij} + \frac{1}{3}\delta_{ij})$

where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Lame constants and $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

Since the material is isotropic, we have:

$c_{11} = c_{22} = c_{33} = 72$ GPa

Using the equation above, we can find:

$\lambda = \frac{c_{11} - \frac{1}{3}c_{11}}{1 - \frac{1}{3}}$

$\lambda = \frac{72 - \frac{1}{3}(72)}{1 - \frac{1}{3}}$

$\lambda = 48$ GPa

$\mu = \frac{c_{11} - \lambda}{2}$

$\mu = \frac{72 - 48}{2}$

$\mu = 12$ GPa

Now we can find $c_{13}$:

$c_{13} = \lambda + \mu = 48 + 12 = 58.6$ GPa

Next, we can find the piezoelectric constant:

$e_{31} = \sqrt{\frac{d_{31}^2}{58.6 - 18.6}}$

$e_{31} = \sqrt{\frac{d_{31}^2}{40}}$

$d_{31} = e_{31}\sqrt{40}$

$d_{31} = e_{31}\times 6.32$ (since $\sqrt{40} = 6.32$)

Now we can use the relationship between the piezoelectric constant, Young's modulus, and the change in polarization:

$\Delta P = e_{31} \Delta E$

$\Delta E = \frac{\Delta P}{e_{31}}$

$\Delta E = \frac{25 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C/m}^2}{e_{31}}$

First, we need to convert the length of the diagonal to the length of a side of the square indentation:

Side length of square indentation = Diagonal length / 2 * sin(45°)
Side length = 0.0005 m / 2 * sin(45°) = 0.00035355 m

Now, we can calculate the actual surface area of the indentation:

Actual surface area of indentation = (Side length^2 * sin(136°/2))^2
Actual surface area = (0.00035355^2 * sin(136°/2))^2 = 0.000001131 m^2

Finally, we can calculate the Vickers hardness:

Vickers hardness = (Applied load / Actual surface area of indentation)
Vickers hardness = (10 kg / 0.000001131 m^2) = 88,616.2 kg/m^2

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is 88,616 kg/m^2.",,,0,

Explanation:

The given problem is about a polymer matrix composite reinforced with long continuous ceramic fibers aligned in one direction. The problem asks for the Young's modulus of the composite in a direction perpendicular to the length of fibers, assuming an isostress condition.

The isostress condition means that the stresses in the fiber and matrix are equal under the given loading condition. Therefore, the strains in the fiber and matrix must also be equal.

The strain in a material is defined as the partial derivative of the potential energy with respect to the spatial coordinates. In this case, the potential energy is given by the strain energy function, which is a function of the spatial coordinates and the material properties.

The strain energy function for a composite material can be written as a sum of the strain energy functions for the fiber and matrix, weighted by their respective volume fractions. Since the strains are equal under the isostress condition, we can set the partial derivatives of the strain energy functions with respect to the spatial coordinates equal to each other.

By equating the partial derivatives, we can derive the following relationship between the Young's moduli of the fiber and matrix, and the volume fraction of the fibers:

$E\_C$ = $fE\_f$ + (1-$f$) $E\_m$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $E\_C$ = $fE\_f$ + (1-$f$) $E\_m$.",,,0,

Explanation:

Fatigue (P) is a phenomenon related to the failure of a material under cyclic loading. The possible mechanism for fatigue is the interaction between dislocations (S-1).

Creep (Q) is a time-dependent deformation process that occurs at elevated temperatures and stresses. The possible mechanisms for creep are grain boundary sliding (1), slip band extrusion and intrusion (2), and dislocation interaction (4). However, since the question asks to match the phenomena with the mechanisms, and grain boundary sliding is the mechanism most directly related to creep, the answer is (B) P-2, Q-4, R-3, S-1.

Strain hardening (R) is a phenomenon where a material becomes harder and more resistant to deformation as it is deformed. The possible mechanisms for strain hardening are not explicitly listed in Group II, but it is mentioned in the context of creep (Q) that the number of dislocations in the material increases, causing hardening that can be experimentally observed by the reduction in the creep rate.

Yield point phenomenon (S) is a phenomenon where a material exhibits a distinct yield point before undergoing plastic deformation. The possible mechanisms for the yield point phenomenon are not explicitly listed in Group II, but it is mentioned in the context of slip band extrusion and intrusion (2) that the operation of two slip systems and the subsequent formation of intrusions and extrusions can predict the occurrence of the yield point phenomenon.

First, let's find the strain rate (ε) during hot extrusion. The extrusion ratio (R) is given as the initial diameter (D1) divided by the final diameter (D2), so R = 10 cm / 5 cm = 2. Therefore, the strain (ln R) is ln 2 = 0.6931.

Now, we can find the strain rate (ε) using the given relationship:

σ = 100 * $(ε)^{0.1}$ MPa

We want to find ε, so we'll solve for it:

ln σ = ln 100 + 0.1 * ln ε

ln σ = 2 + 0.1 * ln ε

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

ln (σ / 100) = ln ε

Now, we can use the strain (ln R) to find ε:

ε = 10^(ln (σ / 100))

Substituting the strain (ln R) we found earlier:

ε = 10^(ln (σ / 100)) = 10^(ln (100 * $(0.6931)^{0.1}))

Now, we can find the flow stress (σ) using the given relationship:

σ = 100 * $(ε)^{0.1}$ MPa

Substituting the calculated strain rate (ε):

σ = 100 * $(10^(ln (100 * $(0.6931)^{0.1})))^{0.1}$ MPa

Calculating the value:

σ ≈ 112.5 MPa

Therefore, to find the yield strength for a grain size of 36 µm, we can interpolate between the given values.

First, let's find the percentage increase in yield strength:

Percentage increase = (New yield strength - Old yield strength) / Old yield strength × 100%
Percentage increase = (145 MPa - 100 MPa) / 100 MPa × 100% = 45%

Now, let's find the yield strength for a 36 µm grain size by interpolating between the given values:

Let x = grain size (in micrometers)
Let y = yield strength (in MPa)

We have two data points: (64, 100), (25, 145)

Using the formula for a linear interpolation:

y = y1 + (y2 - y1) * (x - x1) / (x2 - x1)

Substituting the values:

y = 100 MPa + (145 MPa - 100 MPa) * (36 µm - 64 µm) / (64 µm - 25 µm)

y = 100 MPa + (45 MPa) * (36/49)

y = 123.88 MPa

Since the answer must be in whole MPa values, we can round up to the nearest whole number:

Answer: (C) 125 MPa

From equation (3.3), we have:

ϕ = ln(1 + ε)

We want to find ε, so we rearrange the equation:

ε = ln(1 + ϕ)

Now, we can substitute the given value of ϕ:

ε = ln(1 + 0.405) ≈ 0.431

Next, we need to find the final gauge length (Lf) using the equation for true strain (3.3) and the initial gauge length (L0) and the change in gauge length (ΔL):

ϕ = ln(1 + ε)

ln(Lf/L0) = ln(1 + ε)

Lf = L0 * exp(ε)

We know that L0 = L0/C0, so we can substitute:

Lf = (L0/C0) * exp(ε)

Now, we can substitute the values we have:

Lf = (L0/C0) * exp(0.431)

To find L0, we can use the given change in gauge length (ΔL = 5 mm):

ΔL = Lf - L0

L0 = Lf - ΔL

We know that Lf = 15mm (since the change in gauge length is 5mm and the initial gauge length is not given), so:

L0 = 15mm - 5mm = 10mm

Now, we can find Lf:

Lf = (10mm/C0) * exp(0.431)

We don't have a value for C0, but we can use the given options to check which one is correct. Let's try each option and see if it results in a true strain of 0.405:

A) If Lf = 10mm, then L0 = 10mm - 5mm = 5mm. Using the true strain equation (3.3), we have:

ϕ = ln(1 + ε)

ln(10/5) = ln(1 + ε)

2 = 1 + ε

ε = 1

This is not the correct answer, as the true strain is 0.405, not 1.

B) If Lf = 12mm, then L0 = 12mm - 5mm = 7mm. Using the true strain equation (3.3), we have:

ϕ = ln(1 + ε)

ln(12/7) = ln(1 + ε)

1.176 = 1 + ε

ε = 0.176

This is not the correct answer, as the true strain is 0.405, not 0.176.

C) If Lf = 15mm (which we already know is the correct answer), then L0 = 15mm - 5mm = 10mm. Using the true strain equation (3.3), we have:

ϕ = ln(1 + ε)

ln(15/10) = ln(1 + ε)

What is the yield strength of the material, in MPa, if Tresca yield criterion is obeyed?"," According to the context provided, the yielding criterion obeyed by the material is the Tresca yield criterion. The Tresca yield criterion states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches the yield strength in shear. The maximum shear stress can be calculated using the principal stresses given by the equation:

The yield strength in shear (k) is related to the yield strength in uniaxial tension (Y) by the equation:

k = Y / √2

Since the yielding criterion is obeyed, the maximum shear stress (τmax) equals the yield strength in shear (k). Therefore, we can solve for the yield strength in uniaxial tension (Y) as follows:

Engineering strain = Stress / Young's modulus

The densities of glass fibre and epoxy are $2.58 g/cm^3$ and 1.14 $g/cm^3$, respectively."," To find the elastic modulus of the composite along the fiber direction, we can use the rule of mixtures (ROM) equation for parallel loading:

Ec = Vf * Ef + Vm * Em

where Ec is the elastic modulus of the composite, Vf is the volume fraction of the fibers, Ef is the elastic modulus of the fibers, Em is the elastic modulus of the matrix, and Vm is the volume fraction of the matrix.

First, we need to find the volume fractions of the fibers and the matrix:

Vf = wt.% of fibers / (wt.% of fibers + wt.% of matrix)
Vf = 60% / (60% + (100% - 60%))
Vf = 60% / 40%
Vf = 0.6

Vm = 1 - Vf
Vm = 1 - 0.6

Ec = Vf * Ef + Vm * Em
Ec = 0.6 * 72.5 GPa + 0.4 * 2.4 GPa
Ec = 43.5 GPa + 0.96 GPa

When the interprecipitate spacing is 500 nm, the stress required is 200 MPa, so we can find the shear modulus by solving for G: G = 200 MPa * 2λ / b.

When the interprecipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm, the stress required will be lower because the dislocation will be able to bypass more easily. The relationship between the stress required and the interprecipitate spacing is given by the Hall-Petch equation, which states that the yield strength is proportional to the square root of the reciprocal of the interprecipitate spacing. Therefore, we can calculate the new yield strength and then find the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass based on the new yield strength and the reduced interprecipitate spacing.

First, we need to find the new yield strength when the interprecipitate spacing is 200 nm. Let's call the yield strength in the original condition Y0 and the new yield strength Y. According to the Hall-Petch equation, Y = Y0 + kd/√(200 nm/500 nm), where kd is a constant that depends on the material and d is the grain size. We don't have a specific value for kd or d in this problem, but we can assume that the grain size remains constant and that the constant kd is proportional to the shear modulus. Therefore, we can write Y = Y0 + CG, where C is a constant that depends on the material and the grain size.

Now we can find the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass based on the new yield strength and the reduced interprecipitate spacing. We can write the equation for the stress required as r = Gb/2λ, where λ is the new interprecipitate spacing. We can find λ by using the Hall-Petch equation and solving for it: λ = (Y/Y0)² * 500 nm. Substituting Y = Y0 + CG, we get λ = [(Y0 + CG)/Y0]² * 500 nm.

Finally, we can find the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass by substituting the new yield strength and the new interprecipitate spacing into the equation: r = Gb/2λ = Gb/[2 * (Y0 + CG)/Y0]² * 500 nm. We don't have a specific value for C or Y0 in this problem, but we can express the answer in terms of these constants: r = Gb/[2 * (Y0/Y)²] * 500 nm.

The volume of a cylinder is given by:

However, it also mentions that vacancy diffusion is more rapid in a fine-grain material due to the larger number of high-angle grain boundaries, which can increase the creep rate. Therefore, a small grain size can decrease creep resistance. Additionally, the text states that fine dispersoid size can also decrease creep resistance due to the increased competition of boundary diffusion and dislocation pipe diffusion, making it more difficult for dislocations to move and causing higher stresses to be required for dislocation motion. Therefore, options A and B are correct answers.)

C) Low stacking fault energy (Explanation: The text states that metals with low stacking fault energy have greater creep resistance due to the wider extended partial dislocations which cannot easily overcome obstacles by cross-slipping or climbing. Therefore, option C is not a correct answer.)

D) High melting point (Explanation: The text states that the higher the melting point of materials, the greater is the creep resistance because creep occurs to a greater extent at a homologous temperature greater than about 0.5, and at a given temperature, the diffusion coefficient on which creep rate depends is lower in materials with high melting points. Therefore, option D is a correct answer.)",,,0,

If the Poisson's ratio is 0.3, the volumetric strain is?(answer up to three decimal places)"," The volumetric strain is given by the equation (1.15) in the text, which states that the volumetric strain is the sum of the partial strains in the x, y, and z directions. The partial strain in the x direction is given by Hooke's law as εx = σx/E, and the strain in the x direction is given by equation (2.18) as σx = νσz. Substituting these values into the equation for the volumetric strain, we get:

D = εx + εy + εz
= (σx/E) + (−εy/C0) + (−εz/C0)
= (νσz/E) + (−εy/C0) + (−εz/C0)
= (ν/E) * (σz) + (−1/C0) * (−εy) + (−1/C0) * (−εz)
= (ν/E) * (σz) + (1/C0) * εy + (1/C0) * εz

Substituting the given values, we have:

D = (0.3/E) * (σz) + (1/C0) * εy + (1/C0) * εz
= (0.3/E) * (0.02) + (1/C0) * εy + (1/C0) * εz

To find the values of εy and εz, we can use the fact that the lateral strains are constant fractions of the longitudinal strain. Since the longitudinal strain is 0.02, the lateral strains are 0.3 * 0.02 = 0.006. Therefore, εy = εz = −0.006.

Substituting these values into the equation for the volumetric strain, we get:

Mechanical,47,G-META-17-52,NUM,41,Given the young's modulus E = 4.5 GPa. A perfectly elastic-plastic material has a yield of 450 MPa and fractures at a strain of 0.45. The ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is? (answer up to three decimal places)," To find the ratio of resilience to toughness, we first need to calculate the resilience and toughness separately.

Resilience:
From the given information, we know that the material is elastic-plastic, so the resilience is given by the area under the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve up to the yield point. Since the material is perfectly elastic-plastic, the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve is a straight line with a slope of E. The yield strain is given as εy = 0.45.

The area under the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve up to the yield point can be calculated as:

A_elastic = 1/2 * E * (εy)²

Substituting the given values:

A_elastic = 1/2 * 4.5 GPa * (0.45)²
A_elastic = 0.0131875 GPa*m³

Resilience = A_elastic = 0.0131875 GPa*m³

Toughness:
The toughness is given by the total area under the stress-strain curve up to the fracture point. Since the material is elastic-plastic, the stress-strain curve consists of an elastic portion and a plastic portion. The elastic portion is a straight line with a slope of E, and the plastic portion is a parabola described by the Hollomon equation.

The area under the stress-strain curve up to the fracture point can be calculated as:

A_total = A_elastic + A_plastic

The area under the plastic portion of the stress-strain curve up to the fracture point can be calculated using the Hollomon equation:

σ = σy + Ce^(nε)

where σy is the yield stress, Ce is the strength coefficient, n is the strain-hardening exponent, and ε is the strain.

At the fracture point, the strain εf is given as 0.45. We can solve for the strength coefficient Ce using the yield stress and the strain at the yield point:

Ce = (σy - σy / (εy)²) / n

Substituting the given values:

Ce = (450 MPa - 450 MPa / (0.45)²) / n
Ce = (450 MPa / 0.1875) / n
Ce = 2432.4 MPa / n

The area under the plastic portion of the stress-strain curve up to the fracture point can be calculated as:

A_plastic = ∫ from εy to εf σ dε

Substituting the given values and using integration by parts:

A_plastic = ∫ from εy to εf (Ce * e^(nε)) dε
A_plastic = Ce * [e^(nε)] from εy to εf - ∫ from εy to εf n * Ce * e^(nε) dε
A_plastic = Ce * (e^(nεf) - e^(nεy)) - n * Ce * ∫ from εy to εf e^(nε) dε
A_plastic = Ce * (e^(n * 0.45) - e^(n * 0)) - n * Ce * [1/n * e^(nε)] from εy to εf
A_plastic = Ce * (e^(0.45n) - 1) - n * Ce * [1/n * (e^(0.45n) - 1)]
A_plastic = Ce * (e^(0.45n) - 1) - Ce * (e^(0.45n) - 1) / n
A_plastic = (Ce / n) * (e^(0.45n) - 1)

A_plastic = (2432.4 MPa / n / 4.5 GPa) * (e^(0.45n) - 1)

(A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture (B) The fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture (D) The fibre will undergo buckling"," Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture.

Explanation:

The given stress of 20 MPa is less than the theoretical cohesive strength or ideal fracture strength of the glass fibre, which is given by the Griffith equation and depends on the surface energy and elastic modulus. The surface energy provided is much smaller than typical fracture strengths of glass, and the elastic modulus is high, indicating that the fibre will not fracture under the given stress. Instead, it will undergo elastic deformation.

Buckling is a different mode of failure that occurs when a slender member is subjected to compressive loading. The given stress is tensile, so buckling is not a concern in this case.

fraction_of_load_borne_by_reinforcement = o'fl / O'cl

First, let's find the potential energy of the rod when it is in contact with the wall. The gravitational potential energy of the rod is given by:

PE = mgh

where m is the mass of the rod, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the center of mass of the rod above the ground.

The center of mass of the rod is located at a distance l/2 from the bottom, so the height h is given by:

h = 30 cm + (0.5)(50 cm) = 45 cm = 0.45 m

The mass of the rod is given by:

m = ρV

where ρ is the density of the rod and V is its volume. The volume of the rod is given by:

V = Al

where A is the cross-sectional area and l is the length. The cross-sectional area can be approximated as the area of a rectangle with base 50 cm and height 30 cm, so:

A = 50 cm × 30 cm = 1500 cm²

The density of the rod is given, but we don't have the value in the question. Let's assume a density of 8000 kg/m³ for simplicity.

m = ρV = (8000 kg/m³)(1500 cm³/m³) = 12,000,000 g·cm

Now we can find the initial potential energy:

PEi = mghi = (12,000,000 g·cm)(9.81 m/s²)(0.45 m) = 5.66 × 10^11 J

When the bottom of the rod is pulled horizontally away from the wall, the top of the rod starts sliding down the wall. The energy of the rod is now kinetic energy, given by:

KE = 1/2mv²

where m is the mass of the top of the rod and v is its velocity. Since the rod is long and thin, we can assume that the mass of the top of the rod is equal to its cross-sectional area times its length times its density:

m = ρAl = (8000 kg/m³)(1500 cm²/m²)(0.5 m) = 6,000,000 g·cm

The initial potential energy is now converted to kinetic energy, so:

KEi = PEi = 5.66 × 10^11 J

Using conservation of energy, we have:

KEi = KEf + PEf

where KEf is the final kinetic energy and PEf is the final potential energy. Since the top of the rod is now at rest on the ground, its final potential energy is zero.

KEi = KEf

Now we need to find the final kinetic energy. The rod slides down the wall with an instantaneous velocity, so its final kinetic energy is given by:

KEf = 1/2mv²

We don't know the velocity directly, but we can find it using the principle of conservation of momentum. When the bottom of the rod is pulled horizontally away from the wall, the rod experiences a force in the direction of the pull. This force is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the rod on the wall.

The force exerted by the rod on the wall is given by:

F = ma

Vb = Alb

where Alb is the cross-sectional area of the bottom of the rod and lb is its length. The cross-sectional area of the bottom of the rod is the same as the cross-sectional area of the rod, so:

If the spacing between the precipitates is increased to 0.5 µm, the shear stress (in MPa)  to bow the dislocation would be?(round off to nearest integer)"," The shear stress to bow a dislocation line between precipitates is given by the Orowan stress, which is given by the equation r = Gb/2λ, where G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector, and λ is the spacing between the precipitates.

To find the shear stress required to bow the dislocation when the spacing between the precipitates is 0.5 µm, we need to find the new value of λ and then use it to calculate the Orowan stress.

First, we can find the new value of λ using the equation λ = k/√ϱ, where k is the interparticle spacing and ϱ is the dislocation density. Since we are given that the spacing between the precipitates is 0.5 µm, we can assume that the dislocation density remains the same, and therefore λ = 0.5 µm /√ϱ.

Next, we can use the given value of the Orowan stress (100 MPa) and the known value of the shear modulus (G) to find the Burgers vector (b) using the equation r = Gb/2λ. Solving for b, we get b = 2λr/G.

Substituting the known values, we get b = 2(0.5 µm /√ϱ) x 100 MPa / 80 GPa = 0.0015 µm.

Now, we can use the new value of λ and the calculated value of b to find the new Orowan stress using the equation r = Gb/2λ. Solving for r, we get r = 80 GPa x 0.0015 µm x 2 / 2 = 12 MPa.

Therefore, the shear stress required to bow the dislocation when the spacing between the precipitates is 0.5 µm is approximately 12 MPa (rounded to the nearest integer).",,,0,

Necking instability occurs during tensile testing when the slope of the true stress-true strain curve equals the true strain at that point. This is because at the onset of necking, the material can no longer harden sufficiently to raise the stress for further deformation in the necked region above that to cause further strain elsewhere.

We need to find the velocity of the liquid aluminum (v).

First, we can calculate the Reynolds number using the given information:

Re = ρvd / μ

where d is the diameter of the steel ball. We don't have the diameter given directly, but we can calculate it using the volume of the steel ball and its density:

V = (4/3)πR³

where R is the radius of the steel ball. We can find the radius by taking the cube root of the volume and the density:

R = (3V / (4π))^(1/3)

Substituting the given density and the calculated volume (from the provided force and density in air and water), we get:

V = (8000 N) / (9.81 m/s² * 7854 kg/m³) = 0.000105 m³

R = (3 * 0.000105 m³ / (4 * π))^(1/3) = 0.0052 m

Now we can calculate the Reynolds number:

Re = ρvd / μ

We want to find v. We can rearrange the Reynolds number equation to solve for v:

v = Re * μ / ρd

Substituting the given values, we get:

v = 5*10^(5) * 1*10^(–3) Pa.s / (2360 kg/m³ * 0.0052 m) = 0.115 m/s

dσ/dε = 1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{-0.75}$

Using the property of logarithms that ln(a^b) = b*ln(a), we get:

GI_internal = (1 - v^2) * (σ^2 * π * a) / E

where v is the Poisson's ratio (assumed to be 0.25 for glass), σ is the applied stress, and a is the crack length.

For the internal crack:
a = 5 μm = 5 × 10^-6 m

The tensile stress (in MPa) required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane is?," To find the tensile stress required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane, we need to determine the resolved shear stress on this plane in the slip direction.

Given:
- Crystal orientation: [100]
- Slip plane: (111)
- Critical resolved shear stress (CRSS): 6 MPa

First, let's find the angle between the slip direction and the tensile axis. In an FCC crystal, the slip direction for the (111) slip system is [112], which makes an angle of 35.3 degrees with the [100] direction.

Now, we can calculate the resolved shear stress using equation (7.4) from the text:

o = P cos θ cos φ/A

where:
- P is the applied tensile stress
- θ is the angle between the slip direction and the tensile axis
- φ is the angle between the slip plane normal and the tensile axis
- A is the area of the slip plane

Since the slip plane is (111), its normal makes an angle of 70.5 degrees with the [100] direction. We can find the normal vector in the given crystal orientation using the Miller indices.

First, we need to find the reciprocal lattice vector for the (111) plane:

b* = (h*i*k*) = (1*1*1*) = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3)

Now, we can find the normal vector n by taking the cross product of two lattice vectors:

n = a × b

where a is the lattice vector in the [100] direction.

a = (1, 0, 0)
b = (1, 1, 1)

a × b = (1, 1, 1) × (1, 0, 0) = (-1, 1, 1)

So, the normal vector n is (-1, 1, 1).

Next, we can find the angle between the normal vector and the [100] direction using the dot product:

cos φ = n · a / (|n| * |a|)

n · a = (-1, 1, 1) · (1, 0, 0) = -1
|n| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3)
|a| = 1

cos φ = -1 / (sqrt(3))

Now, we can calculate the resolved shear stress:

o = P cos θ cos φ / A

θ = 35.3 degrees = 35.3 radians
A = area of the (111) plane

We don't have the exact area of the (111) plane, but we can calculate it using the lattice constant a:

A = a^2 * sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

A = (1)^2 * sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = √3

Now, we can calculate the resolved shear stress:

o = P cos 35.3 deg cos (-1 / (sqrt(3))) / √3

To find the tensile stress required for initiating slip, we need to find the value of P that makes the resolved shear stress equal to the critical resolved shear stress:

6 MPa = P cos 35.3 deg cos (-1 / (sqrt(3))) / √3

Percent theoretical density (green) = 55%

Since the shrinkage is assumed to be uniform, the volume shrinkage is equal to the cube of the linear shrinkage raised to the power of 3. We can use the relationship between density, porosity, and shrinkage to find the linear shrinkage:

Porosity = 100% - Percent theoretical density

Porosity (green) = 100% - 55% = 45%

The length of the crack (in m) after one million cycles will be?(answer up to three decimal places)."," To find the length of the crack after one million cycles, we need to use the given crack propagation rate equation and integrate it over the desired number of cycles.

First, let's find the value of ΔK for the given stress range:

ΔK = σ(maximum) - σ(minimum) = 200 MPa - 0 MPa = 200 MPa

Now, we can use the given crack propagation rate equation to find the crack length after one million cycles:

da/dN = $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$

We want to find the crack length after N cycles, so we need to integrate da/dN with respect to a from the initial length a0 = 1 m to the final length a after one million cycles (N = 10^6):

∫[da/dN] from a0 to a = ∫[$10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$] da

To solve this integral, we can use the power rule of integration:

∫[$10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$] da = $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$ ∫da = $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$ [a] from a0 to a

Substituting the limits of integration, we get:

$10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$ [a] from 1 to a = $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$ (a - 1)

Now, we can find the value of a after one million cycles by setting the integral equal to the crack length after one million cycles (N = 10^6):

$10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$ (a - 1) = 10^6

Solving for a, we get:

a = 1 + 10^6 * $10^(12)$ / $(ΔK)^3$

Substituting the value of ΔK, we get:

a = 1 + 10^6 * $10^(12)$ / (200 MPa)^3

Calculating the value of a, we get:

a = 1 + 1.267 * 10^10

a = 1.267 * 10^10 m

Therefore, the length of the crack after one million cycles will be approximately 1.267 * 10^10 m or 12.67 * 10^9 m.

However, this answer seems too large, as the initial crack length was only 1 m. It's likely that there is an error in the given crack propagation rate equation or the units are not consistent. Therefore, the answer may not be accurate.",,,0,

Δh = μ²R/C₂₂r₀

where R is the roll radius, C₂₂r₀ is the elastic deformation parameter of the rolls, and μ is the coefficient of friction.

Given that the roll diameter is 200 mm, the coefficient of friction is 0.1, and we need to find the maximum possible reduction to one decimal place.

First, we need to find the elastic deformation parameter of the rolls, Cris, using equation (12.27):

Cris = Er/C₂₂r₀

where Er is the elastic modulus of the roll material. Let's assume the elastic modulus of steel rolls is 207 GPa.

Cris = (207 × 10⁹ Pa)/(C₂₂r₀)

Now, we can find the maximum possible reduction using the given equation:

Δh = μ²R/C₂₂r₀

Δh = (0.1)²(200/2)²/(C₂₂r₀)

To find the value of C₂₂r₀, we can use the given equation (12.99a):

hₓmin/lR/C₂₂r₀ = 12:99

where hₓmin is the minimum thickness below which the workpiece cannot be reduced further. Let's assume that the minimum thickness is 0.5 mm.

hₓmin = 0.5 mm
l = 200 mm
R = 200/2 = 100 mm

hₓmin/lR/C₂₂r₀ = 12:99

C₂₂r₀ = hₓmin/lR/12:99

C₂₂r₀ = 0.5/100/12:99

Now, we can find the maximum possible reduction:

Δh = μ²R/C₂₂r₀

Δh = (0.1)²(100)²/(0.5/100/12:99)

Δh = 0.1²(10000)²/(0.000418)

First, let's find the angle between the [321] crystallographic direction and the [101] slip direction. The [101] direction is given by [1 0 1], and the [321] direction is given by [1 1 2]. We can find the angle between these two directions using the dot product:

cosθ = ([1 1 2] · [1 0 1]) / (||[1 1 2]|| ||[1 0 1]||)

where ||·|| denotes the Euclidean norm.

Calculating the dot product and norms:

cosθ = (1*1 + 1*0 + 2*1) / (sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) * sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2))
cosθ = (1 + 0 + 2) / (sqrt(1+1+4) * sqrt(1+1+1))
cosθ = 3 / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(3))
cosθ = 3 / (2.44948974278317)
cosθ ≈ 1.225

Now, we can use Schmid's law to find the resolved shear stress:

τs = τ * cosθ

where τ is the applied tensile stress, which is 10 MPa.

τs = 10 MPa * 1.225
τs ≈ 12.25 MPa

So, the value of the resolved shear stress on the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system is approximately 12.25 MPa.",,,0,

W = ∫∫πD1²hFdA

First, we need to find the extrusion ratio, R:

R = A1 / A2 = πD1² / πD2² = (D1 / D2)²

Given that D1 = 20 mm and D2 = 16 mm, we have:

R = (20 mm / 16 mm)² = 1.25

Next, we can find the extrusion force using the equation:

F = A1 * Y * ln R

where Y is the flow stress in compression:

F = π(20 mm)² * 40 MPa * ln 1.25 = 117.65 kN

Now, we can calculate the ideal plastic work:

W = ∫∫πD1²hFdA = ∫∫π(20 mm)² * 100 mm * 117.65 kN * dA

The differential area dA for a cylindrical billet is dA = 2πhD, so:

W = ∫∫2π * 100 mm * 117.65 kN * 2πh * D mm

W = 2π * 100 mm * 117.65 kN * π * D1² * R^(1/2)

Substituting R = 1.25, we get:

W = 2π * 100 mm * 117.65 kN * π * (20 mm)² * 1.25^(1/2) = 115.7 J

Assume no change in the width of the plate"," From the given information, we know that the plate is rolled from a thickness of 5 𝑐𝑚 to a thickness of 3 𝑐𝑚. We can use the principle of conservation of volume to find the exit velocity.

The volume of the plate before rolling is given by:

Vbefore = width × thickness = 100 𝑐𝑚 × 5 𝑐𝑚 = 500,000 𝑐³

After rolling, the volume of the plate remains the same, so:

Vafter = width × thickness = 100 𝑐𝑚 × 3 𝑐𝑚 = 300,000 𝑐³

From the principle of conservation of volume, we have:

Vbefore = Vafter

500,000 𝑐³ = 300,000 𝑐³

To find the exit velocity, we can use the equation:

Vbefore = Vafter = m × (Abefore × vbefore) = m × (Aafter × vafter)

where m is the mass of the plate, Abefore is the initial area, Aafter is the final area, vbefore is the initial velocity, and vafter is the final velocity.

We are given that the initial velocity is 10 𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1), and the initial area is:

Abefore = width × thickness = 100 𝑐𝑚 × 5 𝑐𝑚 = 500,000 𝑐²

To find the final area, we can use the given thickness of 3 𝑐𝑚:

Aafter = width × thickness = 100 𝑐𝑚 × 3 𝑐𝑚 = 300,000 𝑐²

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

500,000 𝑐³ = 300,000 𝑐² × m × vafter

Solving for vafter, we get:

vafter = (500,000 𝑐³ / 300,000 𝑐² × m) 𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)

Since the mass of the plate is given by:

m = density × volume = 7,850 𝑔.𝑚/𝑐³ × 500,000 𝑐³ = 3,925,000 𝑔

Substituting this value into the equation for vafter, we get:

The resolved shear stress on a slip system with slip plane normal n and slip direction s can be calculated using Schmid's law:

τrs = σn·s

where σn is the normal stress on the slip plane. In this case, the normal stress on the slip plane is the same as the applied tensile stress, which is given by:

σ = P/A

where P is the applied load and A is the cross-sectional area of the crystal.

Now, let's calculate the resolved shear stress for each of the given slip systems:

A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]:
n = [0 -1 1]
s = [1 -1 -1]
τrs = σn·s = (0 -1 1)·[1 -1 -1] = -1

B) (-1 -1 1)[011]:
n = [011]
s = [-1 -1 1]
τrs = σn·s = (011)·[-1 -1 1] = -1

C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]:
n = [1 -1 0]
s = [-1 -1 1]
τrs = σn·s = [1 -1 0]·[-1 -1 1] = -1

D) (-1 -1 1)[101]:
n = [101]
s = [-1 -1 1]
τrs = σn·s = [101]·[-1 -1 1] = 0

Since all the resolved shear stresses are equal to -1, we need to consider the sign of the shear stress component of the applied load. In tension, the shear stress is zero, and the normal stress is the applied tension. Therefore, the slip system with a zero resolved shear stress (D) will not be activated in this case.

So, the slip system that will be activated first is either A or B, which have the same resolved shear stress. However, the actual behaviour of the crystal may depend on other factors such as the presence of other slip systems, interactions between dislocations, and temperature. In general, the slip system with the highest Schmid factor (the cosine of the angle between the slip plane normal and the applied stress direction) is more likely to be activated first. In this case, the Schmid factors for systems A and B are both 1, so it is not possible to determine which one will be activated based on this information alone. Experimental observations or additional information about the crystal structure and deformation mechanisms may be needed to make a definitive answer.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine with certainty which slip system will be activated first in an aluminium single crystal loaded in tension along the [1 -1 0] axis. However, among the given options, both systems A and B have an equal chance of being activated first.",,,0,

To find the value of f, we can use inverse tangent function:

f = tan⁻¹(0.2) ≈ 11.31°

rmax = h1 / (4R sin² f)

First, we need to find the critical crack size, a\_c, which will cause fracture when the applied stress intensity factor, K\_I, equals K\_IC.

From the given equation for the stress intensity factor, K\_I = K\_IC / (1 + 1.12 f(a/w)), where f(a/w) is the crack geometry factor and assumed to be unity.

We want to find the maximum allowed stress, so we need to find the critical crack size, a\_c, which will cause fracture when the applied stress is at the maximum allowed level. Let's call this stress, S.

We know that the critical crack size, a\_c, is related to the stress intensity factor, K\_I, through the equation K\_I = K\_IC / (1 + 1.12 f(a/w)). We can rearrange this equation to find a\_c:

a\_c = [(K\_IC / K\_I) - 1] / (1.12 f)

a\_c = [(30 MPa$m^(1/2)$ / 30.5 MPa) - 1] / (1.12)

a\_c = 1.002 mm

Initial diameter: D1 = 30 mm
Final diameter: D2 = 20 mm

From the given flow behavior equation, we have:

𝜖 = ln(D1/D2)

𝜖 = ln(30/20)

𝜖 = ln(1.5)

𝜖 = 0.405

Forging is a metal forming process that involves shaping and deforming a metal piece under high pressure and temperature. It is not a ceramic forming process. Ceramic forming processes include extrusion, slip casting, and tape casting, among others. Extrusion involves forcing a ceramic material through a die to create a desired shape, slip casting involves pouring a ceramic slurry into a porous mold and allowing the water to evaporate, leaving behind a solid ceramic part, and tape casting involves spreading a thin layer of ceramic slurry onto a moving substrate and then drying and firing the resulting tape to create a thin, flat ceramic part.",,,0,

In the vulcanization of 50 g of natural rubber, 10 g of sulfur is added. Assuming the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is"," To find the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites, we first need to determine the number of sulfur atoms that can react with the mer units in the natural rubber.

Given:
- Atomic weight of S: 32 amu
- Molecular weight of a mer of natural rubber: 68 amu
- Mass of natural rubber: 50 g
- Mass of sulfur: 10 g

First, let's calculate the number of mers in 50 g of natural rubber:

Molecular weight of natural rubber = 68 amu/mer
Mass of natural rubber = 50 g
Number of mers = Mass of natural rubber / Molecular weight of natural rubber
Number of mers = 50 g / 68 amu/mer = 7.35 × 10²² mers

Now, let's calculate the number of sulfur atoms that can react with the mer units:

Mass of sulfur = 10 g
Atomic weight of S = 32 amu
Number of sulfur atoms = Mass of sulfur / Atomic weight of S
Number of sulfur atoms = 10 g / 32 amu/atom = 312.5 atoms

Since we cannot have a fraction of an atom, we can only have 312 sulfur atoms in this reaction.

Next, let's calculate the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites:

Number of mer units in natural rubber = 7.35 × 10²² mers
Number of sulfur atoms = 312
Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites = (Number of sulfur atoms / Number of mer units) × 100%
Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites = (312 / 7.35 × 10²²) × 100% ≈ 0.0043%

So, the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is approximately 0.0043%.",,,0,

Atomic percentage = (Weight percentage / Atomic weight) × 100%

Given: Weight percentage of carbon = 6%
Atomic weight of carbon = 12 g/mol
Atomic weight of iron = 56 g/mol

First, we need to convert the weight percentage to a decimal:

6% = 0.06

Now, we can calculate the atomic percentage:

Atomic percentage = (0.06 / 12) × 100% = 0.5% × 100% = 5%

However, the answer is given in atomic percentage, not in percentage. To convert the percentage to atomic percentage, we need to divide by 100:

Atomic percentage = 5% / 100% = 0.05

To check if our answer is close to the given value of 6%, we can calculate the weight percentage of carbon from its atomic percentage:

Weight percentage = Atomic percentage × Atomic weight / Total atomic weight

Total atomic weight = Atomic weight of carbon + Atomic weight of iron = 12 + 56 = 68

Weight percentage = 0.05 × 12 / 68 × 100% = 5.88%

The difference between the given value (6%) and the calculated value (5.88%) is small, so our answer is approximately correct.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 30, but the correct answer is (E) 5.88 or approximately 6%. However, since the question asks for the atomic percentage, the answer is (B) 0.05 or approximately 0.5%.

Explanation:

Solid state sintering (P) is a process where the particles in a material are brought together and bonded without melting them. It is suitable for materials that have a high melting point or are difficult to melt. Therefore, it is most commonly used for iron powder products (3).

Liquid phase sintering (Q) is a process where a liquid phase is present during sintering, which helps to wet the particles and promote bonding. It is commonly used for materials that have a low melting point or are difficult to consolidate by solid state sintering alone. Carbon nanotube products (1) are often produced using liquid phase sintering.

Spark plasma sintering (R) is a high-temperature, high-pressure sintering process that uses a plasma arc to heat and consolidate materials. It is commonly used for the sintering of refractory materials and advanced ceramics. Mixtures of Cu and Zn powder (2) are often sintered using this method.

Laser sintering (S) is a process where a laser beam is used to selectively sinter powder particles.

Agitation of melt

Explanation: In zone refining, impurities are preferentially collected in the molten zone and swept towards the end of the bar, leaving the remaining material with higher purity. The process relies on the difference in solubility of impurities in the solid and liquid phases, as well as the thermal gradient and cooling rate to drive the separation.

The smallest integer value of ‘n’ such that P(n) ≤ ½ is? (round off to the nearest integer) "," To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½, we need to find the probability of no accidents in 'n' months, given that the probability of an accident in one month is 1/100.

We know that the probability of an accident in one month is p = 1/100, and the probability of no accident in one month is p' = 1 - p = 99/100. Since the events of individual months are independent of each other, the probability of no accidents in 'n' months is given by the product of the probabilities of no accidents in each month:

P(n) = p'^n = (99/100)^n

To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½, we need to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that (99/100)^n ≤ ½.

We can take the logarithm base 10 of both sides to simplify the calculation:

ln(P(n)) = ln(p'^n) = n * ln(p')

We want to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that ln(P(n)) ≤ ln(½) = -ln(2).

Using a calculator, we find that ln(99/100) ≈ -0.0498.

Therefore, the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½ is:

1. Density of the green compact:
Theoretical density = 6.76 g/cm³
Sintered density = 6.60 g/cm³
Porosity = 18% = 0.18

Green density = Theoretical density × (1 - Porosity)
Green density = 6.76 g/cm³ × (1 - 0.18)
Green density = 5.52 g/cm³

2. Volume of the porosity:
Volume of the green compact = (Side)³
Volume of the sintered compact = (Side)³ × (1 - Porosity)

Since the densities are given, we can set up an equation to find the side length of the green compact:

Mass of the green compact = Mass of the sintered compact
Volume of the green compact = Volume of the sintered compact

(Side)³ × 5.52 g/cm³ = (2 cm)³ × 6.60 g/cm³

Solving for the side length:

Weight percentage of CaO = 55% = 0.55 * 100% = 0.55
Weight percentage of MgO = 10% = 0.1 * 100% = 0.1
Weight percentage of SiO2 = 20% = 0.2 * 100% = 0.2
Weight percentage of Al2O3 = 15% = 0.15 * 100% = 0.15

Molar mass of CaO = 40 g/mol, Molar mass of MgO = 24 g/mol, Molar mass of SiO2 = 60 g/mol, Molar mass of Al2O3 = 78 g/mol

Mole fraction of CaO = $X_(CaO)$ = (mass of CaO / total mass) = (0.55 * 100%) / (100% + 55% + 10% + 15%) = 0.312
Mole fraction of MgO = $X_(MgO)$ = 0.053
Mole fraction of SiO2 = $X_(SiO_2)$ = 0.219
Mole fraction of Al2O3 = $X_(Al_(2)O_(3))$ = 0.125

Now we can calculate the value of $C_S$ using the given equation:

log $C_s$ = 3.44* (0.312 + 0.1*0.053 - 0.8*0.125 - 0.219) - (9894/1900) + 2.05

Explanation:

The solution-loss reaction refers to the reaction between the molten iron and the impurities in the blast furnace, which form a slag and float on top of the molten iron due to its lower density. The top pressure in a blast furnace operation affects the rate of this reaction. A high top pressure in the blast furnace suppresses the solution-loss reaction because it decreases the gas-solid contact time and reduces the amount of oxygen available for the reaction.

Explanation:

The assertion (a) states that deoxidation and decarburisation of liquid steel are done by vacuum treatment process. However, this is not always true. Vacuum treatment is one method used for deoxidation and decarburisation, but other methods such as the addition of deoxidizers and reducing agents can also be used.

The reason (r) states that decreased partial pressure of CO(g) promotes deoxidation and decarburisation. This statement is true. In vacuum treatment, the partial pressure of CO(g) is decreased, which promotes the reaction between the impurities (oxygen and carbon) in the liquid steel and the reducing agents (such as aluminum or silicon) added to the steel. This results in the removal of oxygen and carbon from the steel, leading to deoxidation and decarburisation.

Therefore, the assertion (a) is false, but the reason (r) is true and it is one of the reasons why vacuum treatment is effective for deoxidation and decarburisation.",,,0,

Based on Chvorinov's rule, the solidified thickness (in cm) after 4 minutes is?"," To find the solidified thickness after 4 minutes using Chvorinov's rule, we need to calculate the Chvorinov constant (B) and the casting modulus (M).

Given:
Thickness of solidified layer after 2 minutes = 3 cm
Tf = Tm = 25°C (assuming the mold temperature is constant)
ρs = 7530 kg/m³
Cp = 728 J/kg K
ΔHf = 247.20 kJ/kg
ks = 73 W/m K
αs = 1/αm = 1.24×10−4 m²/s

First, calculate the Chvorinov constant (B):
B = παm [ρs/ΔHf km(Tf−To)]²
B = π(1.24×10−4 m²/s) [(7530 kg/m³)/(247.20 kJ/kg) (73 W/m K)(25°C−25°C)]²
B = 11.5410 min/cm²

Next, calculate the casting modulus (M):
M = V/A = (length × width) / (2 × thickness)
M = (length × width) / (2 × 3 cm)
M = (length × width) / 6 cm²

Now, use Chvorinov's rule to find the solidified thickness after 4 minutes:
t = B(V/A)²
t = B(M)²
t = 11.5410 min/cm² (11.5410 min/cm²)²
t = 133.13 min²
t = 16.71 cm²
s(t) = V/A = M
s(t) = √(M)
s(t) = √(16.71 cm²)
s(t) = 4.11 cm

So, the solidified thickness after 4 minutes is approximately 4.11 cm.",,,0,

Explanation:
The given context describes the production of pig iron in a blast furnace using iron ore, limestone, and coke. The iron ore is reduced to iron in the presence of carbon monoxide, which is generated by the reaction between coke and hot air supplied from below via tuyeres. The iron and impurities form a molten iron pool at the bottom of the furnace, while the impurities and flux react to form a slag layer on top. The slag helps in the separation of impurities from the molten iron.

The context also mentions that the chemistry in the blast furnace is complex due to gradients in temperature and composition throughout the furnace cavity. The primary reactions in the blast furnace are the reduction of iron oxides to iron liquid via reaction with carbon monoxide and the reaction of carbon from the coke with oxygen in the hot air to produce heat and carbon monoxide.

The context also states that the impurities in the ore react with limestone to decrease in its melting temperature and weight, allowing them to move to the surface of the molten metal as slag and be eliminated from the furnace. This shows that a higher basicity (more calcium oxide in the flux) is required to promote the formation of a sufficient amount of slag to remove impurities effectively.

However, the context also states that the temperature in the blast furnace is kept relatively low (around 1650 °C) to prevent the formation of metal carbides and to ensure the efficient reduction of iron oxides. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) lower temperature and higher basicity.",,,0,

The iron ore charged into the furnace contains 95% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ and the rest is gangue. Assume that all the iron in the ore goes to hot metal. The amount of iron ore (in kg) required for producing 1000 kg of hot metal is ?," To find the amount of iron ore required to produce 1000 kg of hot metal, we first need to determine the mass of iron in the hot metal and the mass of iron in the iron ore.

The mass of iron in 1000 kg of hot metal is 950 kg (since the hot metal contains 95% Fe).

The mass of iron in the iron ore can be calculated by finding the mass percentage of Fe in the iron ore and then multiplying it by the total mass of iron ore required.

We are given that the iron ore contains 95% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$, so the mass percentage of Fe in the iron ore is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 (since only 95% of the ore is iron).

Therefore, the mass of iron in the iron ore required to produce 1000 kg of hot metal is:

1000 kg * (0.9025 / 0.95) = 952.38 kg

Since the atomic weight of Fe is 56 g $mol^(-1)$ and that of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ is 160 g $mol^(-1)$, we can convert the mass of iron ore to moles:

952.38 kg * (1 mol / 56 g) = 17.13 mol

Finally, we can convert the moles of iron ore to kg by multiplying by the atomic weight of iron ore ($Fe_(2)O_(3)$):

17.13 mol * 160 g $mol^(-1)$ = 2739.68 kg

First, let's find the value of $q_m(z)$ at the meniscus ($z=0$).

$q_m(0) = [2.67 - 0.33(0)^(0.5)] * 10^6 = 2.67 * 10^6 \text{ W/m}^2$

Now, we'll find the value of $q_m(z)$ at the bottom of the mould ($z=L_m$).

$q_m(L_m) = [2.67 - 0.33((L_m/U_c))^(0.5)] * 10^6$

Substitute the given values:

$q_m(L_m) = [2.67 - 0.33((0.8/0.2))^(0.5)] * 10^6 = [2.67 - 0.33(4)^(0.5)] * 10^6 = [2.67 - 0.33(2*2)] * 10^6 = [2.67 - 0.33(4)] * 10^6 = 1.33 * 10^6 \text{ W/m}^2$

Now, we'll find the integral of $q_m(z)$ over the length of the mould.

$\text{Average mould flux} = \frac{1}{L_m} \int_0^{L_m} q_m(z) dz$

Substitute the limits of integration and the expression for $q_m(z)$:

$\text{Average mould flux} = \frac{1}{0.8} \int_0^{0.8} [2.67 - 0.33((z/0.2))^(0.5)] * 10^6 dz$

To solve this integral, we can use numerical integration methods or approximate it using the trapezoidal rule. Here, we'll use the trapezoidal rule.

$\text{Average mould flux} \approx \frac{1}{0.8} \left[ \frac{1}{2} [q_m(0) + q_m(L_m)] \right]$

Neglecting material losses, the yield of Fe (in %) is?"," To calculate the yield of Fe in BOF steelmaking, we first need to determine the mass of CaO and Fe in the hot metal and the slag.

Mass of CaO in hot metal = 100 metric ton × 93.2 wt.% Fe × 0.0632 wt.% CaO
= 612.48 ton

Mass of Fe in hot metal = 100 metric ton × 93.2 wt.% Fe

Mass of CaO in slag = 5 metric ton × 90 wt.% CaO

Assuming Henrian activity coefficient of both O and C to be unity, the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of a plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600° C is?(answer up tp four decimal places)"," To calculate the dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt, we need to use the equilibrium constant expression and the ideal gas law.

First, let's convert the given logK expression to an equilibrium constant expression:

logK = log(aO * aC / aCO) = log aO + log aC - log aCO

Since the activity coefficients for O and C are assumed to be unity, we have:

log K = log aO - log aCO

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant expression and the ideal gas law to find the dissolved oxygen content.

From the given reaction: C(s) + O(g) = CO(g)

We have:

K = [O] / [C] * [CO]

Since the partial pressure of CO is equal to 1 atm, we can use the ideal gas law to find [CO]:

[CO] = P / (RT) = 1 / (RT)

Now, we can find [O] using the equilibrium constant expression:

[O] = K * [C] * [CO] = K * [C] / (RT)

We need to find the mass fraction of O in the gas phase, which is related to its mole fraction through the ideal gas law:

xO = (nO / (nO + nC)) = (PO / (Ptotal)) = ([O] / ([O] + [C])) = ([O] / ([C] + [O])) = (K * [C] / (RT * (K * [C] + 1)))

Now, we can find the mass% of O in the liquid phase by multiplying xO by the total mass% of C in the melt:

mass%O = xO * mass%C = xO * 0.7

Using the given logK expression, we can find K at T = 1600°C:

log K = log(aO / aCO) = log(PO / PCO) = log(PO / 1) = log PO

T = 1600°C = 1933.15 K

log K = log(PO) = log(101325 Pa / 101325 Pa) = 0

So, PO = 1 atm = 101325 Pa

Now, we can find xO:

xO = K * [C] / (RT * (K * [C] + 1)) = 101325 Pa * 0.0007 / (8.314 J/mol*K * (1933.15 K * 0.0007 + 1) J/mol) = 0.000115

Finally, we can find the dissolved oxygen content:

(A) 0.06 (B) 0.002 (C) 0.02 (D) 0.0002"," To find the new value of K when the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm, we can use the Henry's law relationship between the activity coefficient and the partial pressure:

ln(aC) = ln(Kp/K) + ln(K)

where Kp is the Henry's law constant for CO in water. Since we are assuming Henry's law is applicable, we can use the given value of K (0.002) when the partial pressure of CO is 1 atm to find the activity coefficient at that condition:

ln(aC) = ln(1 atm / 0.002) + ln(0.002)
ln(aC) = ln(500) + ln(0.002)
ln(aC) = 3 + ln(0.002)
ln(aC) ≈ 3.105

Now, we can use the relationship between activity and mole fraction (X) in a binary solution:

aC = XC
aO = XO

Since the total mole fraction of the solution is 1, we have:

XC + XO = 1

We know that the mole fraction of CO is proportional to its partial pressure, so:

XCO = $𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$ / (total pressure)

Substituting the given value of $𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$ (0.1 atm) and the total pressure (1 atm), we get:

XCO = 0.1 / 1.1 = 0.091

Since the total mole fraction of C and O must be 1, we can find the mole fraction of C by subtracting the mole fraction of O from 1:

XC = 1 - XO
XC = 1 - (1 - XCO)
XC = 1 - (1 - 0.091)
XC = 0.101

Now, we can find the new value of K using the relationship between activity and mole fraction:

ln(K) = ln(aC) = ln(XC)
ln(K) = ln(0.101)
ln(K) ≈ -1.953

To find the value of K with the new value of ln(K), we can use the original relationship:

ln(K) = ln(wt.%C) + ln(wt.%O)

Solving for wt.%C, we get:

wt.%C = e^(ln(K) - ln(wt.%O))
wt.%C = e^(-1.953 - ln(wt.%O))

Since wt.%O is not given, we cannot directly calculate the new value of K. However, we can find the answer among the given options by comparing the values of ln(K) for each option.

Let's calculate the value of ln(K) for each option:

The order of oxidation of impurities depends on their position in the Ellingham diagram, which shows the relative stabilities of metal oxides.

From the context provided, we can infer that phosphorus is oxidized selectively from molten iron by adjusting the activities of the components of the reaction. This is achieved by forming a slag in which the phosphorus oxide and iron oxide can dissolve and have an activity of less than one. The activity of FeO in the slag is much greater than that of P2O5, and the activity of FeO is typically around 0.2.

A blast furnace uses hematite ore with 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. It uses 600 kg coke per ton of hot metal. The coke contains 85% C and 15%ash. The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5%C.

1. Weight of iron in hot metal:
The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5% C. Therefore, the weight of iron in 1 ton of hot metal is:

95.5 kg Fe/ton * 1000 kg/ton = 955 kg

2. Weight of iron in iron ore:
The iron ore contains 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. The weight of $Fe_(2)O_3$ in 1 ton of iron ore is:

0.8 * 1000 kg/ton = 800 kg

Since $Fe_(2)O_3$ contains 56.4% Fe (as FeO), the weight of Fe in 800 kg $Fe_(2)O_3$ is:

800 kg * 0.564 = 451.2 kg

Therefore, the weight of iron ore required to produce 1 ton of hot metal is:

451.2 kg Fe / 0.955 = 473.6 kg/kg Fe in hot metal

3. Weight of slag produced:
The gangue materials in the iron ore and the ash in the coke form slag. The weight of gangue materials in 1 ton of iron ore is:

20% * 1000 kg/ton = 200 kg

The weight of ash in 600 kg coke is:

600 kg * 15% = 90 kg

Therefore, the total weight of gangue materials and ash is:

200 kg + 90 kg = 290 kg

Since the weight of iron in the slag is negligible, the weight of slag produced is equal to the weight of gangue materials and ash:

290 kg

Therefore, the weight of iron ore required is 473.6 kg and the weight of slag produced is 290 kg.

Explanation: In BOF steelmaking, phosphorus removal is achieved by forming a slag layer on top of the molten iron. The slag is designed to have a lower density than the molten iron, allowing it to float on the surface. The slag contains phosphorus oxides, which are formed by the reaction of phosphorus with oxygen. The activity of oxygen in the slag is reduced by the addition of aluminum, allowing the selective oxidation of phosphorus from the iron.

The factors that promote effective phosphorus removal include a higher FeO level in the slag, which increases the activity of aluminum and enhances the reaction between phosphorus and oxygen. A higher basicity of the slag, which increases the solubility of phosphorus oxides in the slag and facilitates their separation from the molten iron. A higher temperature, which increases the reaction rates and enhances the solubility of phosphorus in the molten iron, making it easier to oxidize.

Therefore, a lower temperature is not desirable for effective phosphorus removal in BOF steelmaking process.",,,0,

From the context, we know that the components are M, S, and O, making it a three-component system. The Gibbs phase rule states that for a three-component system at constant temperature and pressure, the maximum number of phases in equilibrium is five. However, since we know that both SO2 and O2 are always present in the roaster as gases, we can consider them as part of the gas phase, reducing the number of possible condensed phases to three. Therefore, the possible solid phases that can co-exist at thermodynamic equilibrium are M, MS, and MO. Thus, the answer is (B) M, MO.

However, it's important to note that the presence of $MSO_4$ as a solid phase at thermodynamic equilibrium is unlikely since it is typically a soluble compound in water and not stable as a solid under the conditions of roasting. Therefore, the answer (A) M, MS, MO, $MSO_4$ is not correct.

Regarding the question about the number of independent reactions needed to define the chemistry of the system, the answer is that at least three independent reactions are required to describe the chemistry of the system since there are three components (M, S, and O) in the system. The set of independent reactions could be:

1. M(s) + SO2(g) + 1/2O2(g) = MS(s) + SO3(g)
2. MS(s) + O2(g) = MO(s) + SO2(g)
3. SO2(g) + 1/2O2(g) = SO3(g)

These reactions describe the oxidation of M to MS, the oxidation of MS to MO, and the dissociation of SO2 to SO3, respectively.

The stoichiometry of the system does not impose any additional constraints on the system since the number of independent reactions is already sufficient to describe the chemistry of the system. The degrees of freedom of the system is 2, which is the number of components minus the number of independent reactions. This value indicates that there are two variables that can be independently controlled in the system, such as temperature and pressure.",,,0,

To prevent aspiration of molten metal, the maximum cross-section area (in $m^2$) at the base of the sprue is?"," To prevent aspiration of molten metal, the pressure at the base of the sprue must be equal to the atmospheric pressure. Bernoulli's equation can be used to design sprue dimensions that prevent aspiration. Assuming turbulent conditions and ignoring friction losses, the mechanical energy balance applied to positions 1 and 3 is:

g(h3^2 - h1^2)/(h3^2 - h1^2) = ρ(P3 - P1)/(h3^2 - h1^2)

where h1 is the velocity head at the top of the pouring cup, h3 is the velocity head at the base of the sprue, ρ is the density of the molten metal, P1 is the atmospheric pressure, and P3 is the pressure at the base of the sprue.

Since the velocity of the melt is zero at position 1 and the velocity at position 3 is given by the flow rate, we have:

h1 = 0
h3 = (4 m^3.s^(-1))/(2g * 2.2 m^2) = 0.1389 m

Assuming the density of the molten metal to be 2380 kg/m^3, we have:

P3 - P1 = ρ * g * h3 = 2380 kg/m^3 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 0.1389 m = 321.5 kPa

The maximum cross-section area at the base of the sprue can be calculated using the equation:

First, let's find the casting modulus (M) for a cylindrical casting:

M = V / A

Where V is the volume and A is the surface area of the casting.

For a cylinder, the volume is given by:

V = πr²h

Where r is the radius and h is the height.

The surface area of a cylinder is given by:

A = 2πrh

Substituting the given dimensions for the cylindrical aluminum bloom:

V = π(375 mm)²(1000 mm) = 1.157 × 10⁶ mm³

A = 2π(375 mm)(1000 mm) = 1.178 × 10⁵ mm²

M = V / A = 1.157 × 10⁶ mm³ / 1.178 × 10⁵ mm² = 1.003

Now, we can use the given mould constant (B) to find the solidification time:

t = B(M)²

Where B = 2 s/$mm² = 2 × 10⁶ s/m² = 2 × 10⁶ s/$m² × (1 m²/10⁶ mm²)² = 2 × 10¹⁴ s/mm²

M = 1.003

t = (2 × 10¹⁴ s/mm²) × (1.003)²

t = 2.006 × 10¹⁵ s = 3.33 × 10⁹ minutes

To convert minutes to seconds, we need to divide by 60:

t = 3.33 × 10⁹ minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 200.08 × 10⁹ seconds

(answer up to three decimal places)"," To find the concentration of carbon in steel at t = 1 min, we can use the given rate equation and the initial condition:

dC/dt = -(c - c*)

We are given that c(t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.% and c* = 0.04 wt.%. We want to find c(t = 1 min).

First, let's find the change in carbon concentration (ΔC) over the time interval of 1 minute:

ΔC = c(t = 1 min) - c(t = 0 min)

Since dC/dt is a negative value (indicating that carbon is being de-carburized), we can find ΔC by integrating the rate equation over the time interval of 1 minute:

∫(dC/dt) dt = ∫(-(c - c*)) dt

Integrating both sides:

∫dC = -∫(c - c*) dt

Evaluating the definite integral:

C(t = 1 min) - C(t = 0 min) = -∫(0.4 - 0.04) dt

C(t = 1 min) - 0.4 = -(0.4 - 0.04) * 1

C(t = 1 min) = 0.36 wt.%

(answer up tp two decimal places) "," To find the height of the riser, we first need to calculate the casting modulus (M) and the Chvorinov constant (B) using the given information for the cubic casting.

The casting modulus (M) can be calculated as:
M = V / A
M = (5.0 cm)³ / (6 * (5.0 cm)²)
M = 0.521 cm⁻¹

The Chvorinov constant (B) can be calculated using the given solidification time (t) and the casting modulus (M):
B = παm⁴ [ρs / Δ1Hf km⁡(Tf - To)]²
B = π * 35 W/mK * (7530 kg/m³ / 247.20 kJ/kg)² * (35 W/mK)²
B = 1.951 min⁻¹ cm²

Now, we can use Chvorinov's rule to find the height of the riser (h):
t = B * (Vr / Ar)²
3.2 min = 1.951 min⁻¹ cm² * (Vr / Ar)²

We know that the diameter of the cylindrical riser is 5.0 cm, so its area (Ar) is π * (5.0 cm)² = 25.1325 cm². To find the volume (Vr) of the riser, we can use its height (h) and diameter (D):
Vr = π * (D/2)² * h
Vr = π * (5.0 cm / 2)² * h
Vr = 18.85 * h

Substituting this expression for Vr into the Chvorinov's rule equation:
3.2 min = 1.951 min⁻¹ cm² * (18.85 * h / 25.1325)²

Solving for h:
h = (3.2 min * 25.1325 / 18.85)² / 1.951 min⁻¹
h = 7.67 cm

Therefore, the height of the riser should be approximately 7.67 cm (answers may vary slightly depending on the precision of the given data).",,,0,

Dhmax = 4Rsin²f

where R is the roll radius, f is the friction coefficient, and Dhmax is the maximum possible reduction. Since the angle of bite is given as 10°, we can find the friction coefficient using Ekelund's expression (12.19a):

sin²a = 2µf / (1 + µ²)

where a is the angle of contact and µ is the coefficient of friction. We can find the angle of contact using the given angle of bite:

a = 180° - 10° = 170°

Now, we can find the friction coefficient:

sin²a = 2µf / (1 + µ²)
sin²(170°) = 2µf / (1 + µ²)
sin²(170°) = 2(0.05)f / (1 + 0.05²)

Solving for f:

f = sin²(170°) / (2(0.05) / (1 + 0.05²))
f = 0.1215

Now, we can find the maximum possible reduction:

Dhmax = 4Rsin²f
Dhmax = 4(0.45 m)sin²(0.1215)
Dhmax = 0.118 m or 118 mm (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction during cold rolling is 118 mm.",,,0,

Assume ideal gas behavior. A 50 mm (diameter) sphere of solid nickel is oxidized in a gas mixture containing 60% argon and 40% oxygen by volume. The rate of oxidation of nickel is controlled by the rate of transport of oxygen through the concentration boundary layer. The rate of oxidation (in moles of nickel per minute (mol/min), rounded off to two decimal places) is"," To calculate the rate of oxidation of nickel, we need to determine the rate of oxygen transport through the concentration boundary layer using the given data and assumptions.

First, we need to find the partial pressures of oxygen and argon in the gas mixture. Since the total pressure is 1 atm and the gas mixture contains 60% argon and 40% oxygen by volume, we have:

Partial pressure of argon (PAr) = 0.6 × 1 atm = 0.6 atm
Partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) = 0.4 × 1 atm = 0.4 atm

Next, we can use Fick's first law of diffusion to calculate the flux of oxygen through the boundary layer:

J = D × (Cs - Cb) / L

where J is the flux, D is the diffusion coefficient, Cs is the saturated concentration of oxygen at the solid surface, Cb is the bulk concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture, and L is the thickness of the boundary layer.

The saturated concentration of oxygen at the solid surface can be calculated using the Ellingham diagram or the Gibbs free energy of formation of nickel oxide. Since we are given the temperature and the total pressure, we can use the Ellingham diagram to find the equilibrium partial pressure of oxygen at these conditions, which is:

Po2,eq = 1.25 × 10−11 atm (from the Ellingham diagram)

The saturated concentration of oxygen at the solid surface is then:

Cs = Po2,eq / (RT) = 1.25 × 10−11 atm / (8.205 × 10−5 × 1173) = 1.53 × 10−12 mol/cm3

The bulk concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture can be calculated from its partial pressure:

Cb = Po2 / (RT) = 0.4 atm / (8.205 × 10−5 × 1173) = 5.12 × 10−5 mol/cm3

The thickness of the boundary layer can be calculated using the given boundary layer mass transfer coefficient:

L = 1 / (k × A) = 1 / (0.03 × π × (0.05 m)2) = 0.0113 m

Now we can calculate the flux of oxygen through the boundary layer:

J = D × (Cs - Cb) / L = (1.6 × 10−5 cm2/s) × (1.53 × 10−12 mol/cm3 - 5.12 × 10−5 mol/cm3) / 0.0113 m = 1.25 × 10−11 mol/cm2s

To find the rate of oxidation of nickel, we need to convert the flux to a rate per unit mass of nickel. The molar mass of nickel is 58.7 g/mol, so the number of moles of nickel in the sphere is:

M = (4/3)πr3 × ρ × V

where r is the radius of the sphere, ρ is the density of nickel (8.9 g/cm3), and V is the volume of the sphere.

V = (π/6)r3 = (π/6) (0.05 m)3 = 0.000113 m3

M = (4/3)π(0.05 m)3 × 8.9 g/cm3 × 1000 g/kg / 1000 kg/m3 = 0.0051 kg

The rate of oxidation of nickel is then:

Rate = J × M = 1.25 × 10−11 mol/cm2s × 0.0051 kg / 1000 = 6.53 × 10−13 mol/min or 0.00000653 mol/min (rounded off to two decimal places)",,,0,

The volume of the blast furnace top gas [in $m^3$ (NTP), rounded off to the nearest integer] is"," To find the volume of the blast furnace top gas, we first need to determine the mass of the gases produced per metric ton of liquid iron. We know that the coke contains 90 wt.% carbon, so the mass of carbon in 1 metric ton of coke is 900 kg. Since the liquid iron contains 3.6 wt.% carbon, the mass of carbon in 1 metric ton of liquid iron is 36 kg. The difference between the masses of carbon in the coke and the liquid iron represents the mass of carbon dioxide produced during the reaction:

Mass of CO2 = Mass of carbon in coke - Mass of carbon in liquid iron
Mass of CO2 = 900 kg - 36 kg
Mass of CO2 = 864 kg

Since the volume of the gases produced is proportional to the number of moles, we can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of each gas. We know that the molar volume of the gas at NTP is 22.4 liter, so the number of moles in 1 liter is 1/22.4 = 0.0451 moles/liter. We can use this conversion factor to find the number of moles of each gas:

Moles of CO = Mass of CO / Molar mass of CO
Moles of CO = 22% of 864 kg / 28 g/mol
Moles of CO = 0.22 × 864 kg / 28 g/mol
Moles of CO = 11.5 moles

Moles of CO2 = Mass of CO2 / Molar mass of CO2
Moles of CO2 = 864 kg / 44 g/mol
Moles of CO2 = 19.6 moles

Moles of N2 = Total moles - Moles of CO - Moles of CO2
Moles of N2 = (1 metric ton / 1000 kg) × 22.4 m3 / 0.0451 moles/m3 - 11.5 moles - 19.6 moles
Moles of N2 = 1.3 moles

Now we can find the total number of moles and the volume of the blast furnace top gas:

Total moles = Moles of CO + Moles of CO2 + Moles of N2
Total moles = 11.5 moles + 19.6 moles + 1.3 moles
Total moles = 32.4 moles

Volume of blast furnace top gas = Total moles × Molar volume of gas at NTP
Volume of blast furnace top gas = 32.4 moles × 22.4 liter/mol
Volume of blast furnace top gas = 721.76 liter

Since the volume is given in cubic meters, we need to convert the liter value to cubic meters:

Volume of blast furnace top gas = 721.76 liter × 1 m3/1000 liter
Volume of blast furnace top gas = 0.722 m3 (rounded off to the nearest integer)

Therefore, the volume of the blast furnace top gas is approximately 0.722 cubic meters (NTP).",,,0,

The quantity(in kg) of slag needed is?(round off to the nearest integer). "," To find the quantity of slag needed, we can use the given sulphur partition ratio and the initial and final sulphur contents in the steel.

First, let's calculate the amount of sulphur that needs to be removed from the steel:

Initial sulphur content in steel = 0.03 wt.% = 3 kg (in 1000 kg of steel)
Final sulphur content in steel = 0.015 wt.% = 1.5 kg

Amount of sulphur to be removed = Initial sulphur content - Final sulphur content = 1.5 kg

Now, we can use the sulphur partition ratio to find the amount of sulphur that will be present in the slag:

Sulphur partition ratio = [(wt.%S)in slag]/[(wt.%S) in steel] = 50

Let x be the weight of sulphur in the slag. Then, the weight of sulphur in the steel will be x/50.

We know that the weight of sulphur in the steel before desulphurization was 3 kg. So,

First, we need to calculate the activity coefficients of carbon and oxygen using Henry's law and the given temperature.

From the context, we know that the standard state for carbon and oxygen is 1 wt.%, so their molalities are equal to their mass fractions. We can use the given data to calculate their activity coefficients:

ln(γC) = ln(aC/[C]^(1)) = ln(P_CO/(1 atm) * (1 wt.% / [C]^(1)))
ln(γC) = ln(1 atm / (1 atm) * (1 / 0.03)) = ln(1 / 0.03) = -1.099

ln(γO) = ln(aO/[O]^(1)) = ln(P_CO/(1 atm) * (1 wt.% / [O]^(1)))
ln(γO) = ln(1 atm / (1 atm) * (1 / 0.03)) = ln(1 / 0.03) = -1.099

Now, we can use the given reaction and the measured [O] and T to calculate the carbon content [C]. We can write the reaction as:

[C]_(1 wt.% Henrian Std. State) + [O]_(1 wt.% Henrian Std. State) → (CO)_(1 atm. Std. State)

Using the given data, we have:

ΔG° = -19840 -40.65 T J = -19840 -40.65 * 1800 J = -3812860 J

We can now use the equation for the Gibbs free energy change at constant temperature and pressure:

ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)

where Q is the reaction quotient. We can calculate Q using the given activities and concentrations:

Q = (aC * aO) / (aCO)^(1)

Using the activity coefficients we calculated earlier, we have:

aC = γC * [C] = 0.03 * exp(-1.099) = 0.0265
aO = γO * [O] = 0.03 * exp(-1.099) = 0.0265
aCO = 1 (since CO is a gas at standard state)

Substituting these values into the equation for Q, we get:

Q = (0.0265 * 0.0265) / 1 = 6.77 × 10^-5

Now, we can calculate ΔG using the given temperature and the equation for Gibbs free energy change:

ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q) = -3812860 J + 8.314 J.mol^-1.K^-1 * 1800 K * ln(6.77 × 10^-5) = -3812860 J - 1.32 × 10^4 J = -3812870 J

Since ΔG < 0, the reaction proceeds spontaneously from left to right, meaning that there is more carbon in the steel than the calculated value. However, we are asked to find the carbon content [C], so we cannot simply subtract the calculated amount of CO produced from the initial carbon content. Instead, we can use the equation for the reaction quotient to find the ratio of [C] to [O]:

Q = (aC * aO) / (aCO)^(1) = ([C] * [O]) / (1)^(1) = [C] / [O]

We know that [O] = 0.03 wt.%, so we can calculate [C] using the measured [O] and the ratio Q:

[C] = Q * [O] = 6.77 × 10^-5 * 0.03 = 2.03 × 10^-5 wt.%

If the sulfur content in the steel is reduced from 0.015 mass% to 0.0025 mass%, the desulfurizing index is? (round off to the nearest integer)."," To calculate the desulfurizing index, we need to find the mass of sulfur removed and divide it by the mass of synthetic slag used.

First, let's find the mass of sulfur in the initial and final states:

Initial mass of sulfur = 100 metric tons * 0.015 mass%
Initial mass of sulfur = 1500 kg

Final mass of sulfur = 100 metric tons * 0.0025 mass%
Final mass of sulfur = 250 kg

Now, we can find the mass of sulfur removed:

Mass of sulfur removed = Initial mass of sulfur - Final mass of sulfur
Mass of sulfur removed = 1250 kg - 250 kg
Mass of sulfur removed = 1000 kg

Finally, we can calculate the desulfurizing index:

Desulfurizing index = Mass of sulfur removed / Mass of synthetic slag used
Desulfurizing index = 1000 kg / 1250 kg
Desulfurizing index ≈ 0.8

Since the desulfurizing index is not an integer, we cannot round it off directly. However, we can round it to the nearest integer if we define the desulfurizing index as the number of metric tons of sulfur removed per metric ton of synthetic slag used. In that case, the desulfurizing index would be approximately 0.83 (rounded to three decimal places). If we want to round it to the nearest integer, we could say that the desulfurizing index is 0.

Therefore, the desulfurizing index is 0 (rounded to the nearest integer), assuming it represents the number of metric tons of sulfur removed per metric ton of synthetic slag used.",,,0,

(A) 0.14 (B) 0.30 (C) 0.70 (D) 0.86," To determine the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, we first need to find the number of monomer units of each type in the copolymer.

The molecular weight of a monomer unit of vinyl chloride is 62.5 g/mol, and the molecular weight of a monomer unit of vinyl acetate is 74.1 g/mol.

The degree of polymerization is the total number of monomer units in the polymer. In this case, the degree of polymerization is 160.

Let x be the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, and (1-x) be the mole fraction of vinyl acetate.

The total number of monomer units in the copolymer is:

Total number of monomer units = x * Number of vinyl chloride monomer units + (1-x) * Number of vinyl acetate monomer units

We can find the number of monomer units of each type by dividing the molecular weight of the copolymer by the molecular weight of a monomer unit of each type:

Number of vinyl chloride monomer units = Total molecular weight / Molecular weight of vinyl chloride monomer unit
= 10520 g/mol / 62.5 g/mol = 167.52

Number of vinyl acetate monomer units = Total molecular weight / Molecular weight of vinyl acetate monomer unit
= 10520 g/mol / 74.1 g/mol = 142.86

Now we can find the mole fraction of vinyl chloride:

x = Number of vinyl chloride monomer units / Total number of monomer units
= 167.52 / (167.52 + 142.86)
= 167.52 / 309.38

Material Applications,11,G-XEC-2014-18,NUM,31,Given: ($M_(Ga)$ = 69.72 g/mol; $M_(As)$ = 74.92 g/mol). The weight in kg of gallium (Ga) to be mixed with arsenic (As) for obtaining 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs) is," To find the weight of gallium required to produce 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide, we first need to determine the molar ratio of gallium to arsenic in GaAs. Since the molar mass of GaAs is the sum of the molar masses of gallium and arsenic, we can find the molar ratio by dividing the molar mass of GaAs by the sum of the molar masses of gallium and arsenic.

Molar mass of GaAs = $M_(Ga)$ + $M_(As)$ = 69.72 g/mol + 74.92 g/mol = 144.64 g/mol

Molar ratio of Ga to As in GaAs = $M_(Ga)$ / ($M_(Ga)$ + $M_(As)$) = 69.72 g/mol / 144.64 g/mol = 0.481

Now we can find the weight of gallium required to produce 1.0 kg of GaAs by multiplying the weight of GaAs by the molar ratio of gallium and dividing by the molar mass of gallium.

Weight of Ga = (1.0 kg / 0.481) * 69.72 g/mol = 146.3 kg

Therefore, 146.3 kg of gallium is required to produce 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide.

However, since the question asks for the weight in kg, not the weight in grams, we need to convert the weight of gallium from grams to kilograms.

Weight of Ga = 146,300 g / 1000 = 146.3 kg

So, 146.3 kg of gallium is required to produce 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide.",,,0,

If the theoretical density of SiC is 3.22 g $cm^(-3)$ and that of $Al_2O_3$ is 3.95 g $cm^(-3)$, estimate the porosity (%) of the composite, assuming that the linear rule of mixtures is valid in this case."," To estimate the porosity of the composite, we can use the linear rule of mixtures assuming that the densities of the two phases are additive. The total weight of the composite is given by:

W\_total = W\_SiC + W\_Al2O3

where W\_SiC and W\_Al2O3 are the weights of SiC whiskers and $Al_2O_3$ matrix, respectively. The total volume of the composite is given by:

V\_total = V\_SiC + V\_Al2O3

where V\_SiC and V\_Al2O3 are the volumes of SiC whiskers and $Al_2O_3$ matrix, respectively. Since the volume fraction of SiC whiskers is 30%, we have:

V\_SiC = 0.3 * V\_total
V\_Al2O3 = (1 - 0.3) * V\_total

The weight of SiC whiskers is given by:

W\_SiC = ρ\_SiC * V\_SiC

where ρ\_SiC is the density of SiC. Similarly, the weight of $Al_2O_3$ matrix is given by:

W\_Al2O3 = ρ\_Al2O3 * V\_Al2O3

Using the given information, we have:

ρ\_total = 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$
ρ\_SiC = 3.22 g $cm^(-3)$
ρ\_Al2O3 = 3.95 g $cm^(-3)$

We can find the total volume of the composite by solving for V\_total:

V\_total = W\_total / ρ\_total
V\_total = (W\_SiC + W\_Al2O3) / ρ\_total
V\_total = [(0.3 * V\_total * ρ\_SiC) + (1 - 0.3) * V\_total * ρ\_Al2O3] / ρ\_total

Simplifying this equation, we get:

V\_total = [0.3 * V\_total * ρ\_SiC + (1 - 0.3) * V\_total * ρ\_Al2O3] / ρ\_total
V\_total = 0.3 * V\_total * (ρ\_SiC / ρ\_total) + (1 - 0.3) * V\_total * (ρ\_Al2O3 / ρ\_total)
V\_total = 0.3 * V\_total * (3.22 g $cm^(-3)$ / 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$) + (1 - 0.3) * V\_total * (3.95 g $cm^(-3)$ / 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$)

Solving for V\_total, we get:

V\_total = 0.3 * V\_total * 0.882 + 0.7 * V\_total * 1.09
V\_total = 0.3 * V\_total + 0.7 * V\_total * 1.09
V\_total = 1.09 * V\_total

Therefore,

V\_total = 1 / (1 - 0.3 * 0.882) = 1.382 * V\_total

Now, we can find the volume of the pores:

V\_pores = V\_total - V\_SiC - V\_Al2O3
V\_pores = V\_total - 0.3 * V\_total - 0.7 * V\_total
V\_pores = -0.3 * V\_total

The porosity is given by:

Porosity = V\_pores / V\_total = -0.3

However, this result is not physically meaningful since the porosity cannot be negative. This indicates that the linear rule of mixtures may not be valid in this case, and other factors such as the size and distribution of the pores need to be considered.

1. Find the mass of one unit cell:
Each unit cell contains two ethylene repeat units. An ethylene repeat unit consists of 2 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.

Mass of one carbon atom = 12.01 g/mol
Mass of one hydrogen atom = 1.008 g/mol

Mass of one ethylene repeat unit = (2 * 12.01 g/mol) + (4 * 1.008 g/mol) = 26.032 g/mol

The mass of the sample in air is 2.67 g and its apparent mass in water is 1.67 g. Calculate the density of the sample in g $cm^(-3)$ (give answer up to 2 decimal places)," To find the density of the sample, we can use the Archimedes method, which involves measuring the difference in weight of the sample in air and in water.

First, we need to find the volume of the sample in water when it is completely submerged. The difference in weight between the sample in air and in water is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the sample.

Apparent mass in water = mass in air - mass of water displaced
1.67 g = 2.67 g - mass of water

We know that the density of water is given as 1.00 g/cm³. We can use this information to find the volume of water displaced by the sample:

Volume of water = mass of water / density of water
mass of water = (2.67 g - 1.67 g) = 1.00 g
Volume of water = 1.00 g / 1.00 g/cm³ = 1.00 cm³

Now that we have the volume of water displaced, we can find the volume of the sample by subtracting the volume of water from the total volume of the container:

Volume of sample = Volume of container - Volume of water
Volume of container = (given or measured)
Volume of sample = (Volume of container - 1.00 cm³)

Finally, we can find the density of the sample by dividing its mass by its volume:

Density of sample = mass of sample / volume of sample

Material Applications,22,G-XEC-2022-6,MCQS,33,Which one of the following solvent environments will likely result in swelling of solid polystyrene?   (A) 0.1 M NaOH in $H_(2)O$ (B) HCl (aq.) of pH = 6 (C) Distilled water (D) Benzene ," The solvent environments that will likely result in swelling of solid polystyrene are those in which the solvent molecules can enter the space between the chain molecules and increase their distance, leading to an increase in volume. Based on the context provided, the solvent that is most likely to cause swelling of solid polystyrene is (D) Benzene.

Explanation:

The context describes that polar polymers like PMMA have a limited solubility for alcohol and polyamide for water, while nonpolar polymers like polystyrene have a limited solubility for polar solvents. However, nonpolar solvents like benzene can dissolve both molecular weights of polystyrene. The solubility of polystyrene in benzene is due to the fact that the solvent molecules can enter the space between the chain molecules and increase their distance, leading to an increase in volume, a phenomenon called swelling.

Therefore, option (D) Benzene is the correct answer.

Option (A) 0.1 M NaOH in $H_(2)O$ is an alkaline solution and is not a good solvent for polystyrene. Polystyrene is not soluble in water and swelling is not expected to occur.

Option (B) HCl (aq.) of pH = 6 is an acidic solution and is not a good solvent for polystyrene. Polystyrene is not soluble in water and swelling is not expected to occur.

Explanation:

Group I:
P - Reduction: This technique involves the reduction of metal oxides or salts to obtain metal powders. It does not have a specific shape associated with it.

Q - Gas Atomization: This technique involves melting the material and forming droplets by injecting it into a high-velocity gas stream. The shape of the particles formed depends on the cooling rate and the gas flow rate. Dendritic or irregularly shaped particles can be formed if the cooling rate is slow, while spherical particles are formed if the cooling rate is fast.

R - Milling: This technique involves the mechanical grinding of solid materials to reduce their particle size. The shape of the particles depends on the milling process and the material being milled. Flaky or plate-like particles can be formed if the milling process involves shear forces, while spongy or porous particles can be formed if the milling process involves impact forces.

S - Electrolysis: This technique involves the deposition of metals from an electrolyte solution onto an electrode. The shape of the deposited metal depends on the electrode geometry and the electrolysis conditions. Spherical or porous particles can be formed if the electrode is in the form of a porous substrate.

Material Applications,26,G-META-13-43,NUM,18,The aperture size (in µm) of a 200 mesh sieve having a wire diameter of 53 µm is?," The aperture size of a 200 mesh sieve can be calculated by using the formula:

aperture size (µm) = 1 / (2 * mesh number)

Given that the wire diameter of a 200 mesh sieve is 53 µm, the mesh number can be calculated as follows:

mesh number = 1 / (2 * wire diameter / µm)

mesh number = 1 / (2 * 53 µm / µm)

mesh number = 1 / 0.106

mesh number = 9.43

Since a mesh number is a round number, the actual mesh number for a 200 mesh sieve is 191 (200 - 9).

Therefore, the aperture size of a 200 mesh sieve can be calculated as:

aperture size (µm) = 1 / (2 * mesh number)

aperture size (µm) = 1 / (2 * 191)

aperture size (µm) = 1.05 µm

So, the aperture size of a 200 mesh sieve having a wire diameter of 53 µm is approximately 1.05 µm.",,,0,

Material Applications,34,G-META-15-25,MCQS,29,"In polymers such as epoxies, creep resistance can be enhanced by  (A) increasing the bulkiness of side groups. (B) increasing the cross-link density. (C) addition of plasticizers. (D) annealing"," The correct answer is (B) increasing the cross-link density.

Explanation:
The context provided mentions that epoxy resins have a very low resistance to fatigue crack initiation and propagation, and various attempts have been made to improve their fatigue life by reinforcing them with fibers and particulates. The text also states that the smaller particles (0.2 µm) have resulted in greater improvement in the resistance to fatigue crack propagation (FCP) than larger particles (1.5 µm), and that V% of particles has no influence on the threshold fatigue (ΔKth) properties, whereas the near-threshold (ΔKth) fatigue properties are strongly affected by the blend morphology. Additionally, the text mentions that nanoparticles have a tendency to form agglomerates in a polymer matrix if not processed properly, and that homogeneous dispersion of second-phase particles in the composite is necessary to achieve enhancement in long-term mechanical behavior.

Based on this context, it can be inferred that increasing the cross-link density in epoxies is an effective way to enhance their creep resistance. Cross-linking is the formation of chemical bonds between polymer chains, which increases the rigidity and strength of the material. Therefore, a higher cross-link density would result in a more rigid and stronger material, which would be less susceptible to creep deformation.

Option (A) increasing the bulkiness of side groups is not directly related to creep resistance in polymers. Option (C) addition of plasticizers would actually decrease the cross-link density and increase the chain mobility, which would decrease the creep resistance. Option (D) annealing is a thermal treatment used to improve the properties of materials by increasing the degree of crystallinity or reducing residual stresses, but it is not directly related to creep resistance in polymers.",,,0,

Material Applications,52,G-META-22-65,NUM,53,"The equilibrium microstructure of an alloy A-B consists of two phases α and β in the molar proportion 2:1. If the overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B and the composition of β is 90 mol% B, the composition(in mol% B) of α is ? (round off to the nearest integer). "," To find the composition of phase α, we can use the lever rule. Let xα be the composition of phase α and xβ be the composition of phase β.

Phase transition,0,G-XEC-2012-17,MCQS-NUM,71,"A plain 0.45 wt.% carbon steel is cooled slowly from 900°C to just below the eutectoid temperature (723°C) so that the following reaction occurs: γ (0.8 wt.% C) ↔ α (0.02 wt.% C) + $Fe_3C$ (6.67 wt.% C). During cooling from 900°C to 723°C, the proeutectoid α forms from γ. Find the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel.   (A) 44.9% (B) 66.1% (C) 55.1% (D) 34.9% "," To find the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel, we need to use the lever rule. The lever rule states that the weight percentage of each phase in a two-phase equilibrium is proportional to the length of the lever arm of that phase from the origin (in this case, the eutectoid composition).

First, we need to find the weight percentages of α and $Fe_3C$ at the eutectoid temperature (723°C). We can use the given composition of γ (0.8 wt.% C) to find the weight percentage of $Fe_3C$:

$Fe_3C = 6.67 wt.% - 0.8 wt.% = 5.85 wt.%$

Then, we can use the given composition of α (0.02 wt.% C) and the total weight percentage of carbon in the steel (0.45 wt.%) to find the weight percentage of α:

$α = 0.45 wt.% - 5.85 wt.% = -5.4 wt.%$

However, this value is not physically meaningful, as it is negative. This indicates that our initial assumption that all of the carbon in the steel would form $Fe_3C$ at the eutectoid temperature was incorrect. Instead, some of the carbon will remain in solution in the α phase.

To find the correct weight percentages of α and $Fe_3C$ at the eutectoid temperature, we can use the lever rule:

$wt.% \alpha = \dfrac{wt.% \gamma (C_γ - C_e)}{C_e - C_α}$

$wt.% Fe_3C = \dfrac{wt.% \gamma (C_e - C_γ)}{C_e - C_α}$

where $C_γ = 0.8 wt.%$, $C_α = 0.02 wt.%$, and $C_e = 0.45 wt.%$ (the total carbon content of the steel).

Calculating the weight percentages of α and $Fe_3C$ at the eutectoid temperature:

$wt.% \alpha = \dfrac{0.8 wt.% (0.45 wt.% - 0.8 wt.%)}{0.45 wt.% - 0.02 wt.%} = 51.67 wt.%$

$wt.% Fe_3C = \dfrac{0.8 wt.% (0.45 wt.% - 0.8 wt.%)}{0.45 wt.% - 0.02 wt.%} = 48.33 wt.%$

Now that we have the correct weight percentages of α and $Fe_3C$ at the eutectoid temperature, we can use the lever rule to find the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C:

$Volume \% \alpha = \dfrac{wt.% \alpha}{wt.% \gamma + wt.% \alpha} \times 100%$

$Volume \% \alpha = \dfrac{51.67 wt.%}{51.67 wt.% + 48.33 wt.%} \times 100% = 52.52\%$

However, the answer must be in volume %, not weight %. To convert weight % to volume %, we need to divide by the density ratio of the two phases:

$Density \ of \ α = 7.8 g/cm^3$

$Density \ of \ Fe_3C = 4.9 g/cm^3$

$Volume \% \alpha = \dfrac{52.52\%}{(\dfrac{7.8 g/cm^3}{4.9 g/cm^3})} \times 100% = 66.1\%$

1. Monotectic reaction: A reaction where a liquid decomposes on cooling to yield a solid phase and a new liquid phase. This is represented by reaction (Q) in Column I, where the liquid is replaced by a new liquid phase. Therefore, the correct answer for monotectic is (Q) or option 1 in Column II.
2. Peritectic reaction: A reaction between a liquid and a solid phase under the formation of a second solid phase during cooling.

3. Peritectoid reaction: A reaction between three crystalline phases, where one solid solution plays the role of the liquid in a similar reaction to peritectic.

(round off to nearest integer) "," To find the weight percentage of B in the alloy, we can use the weight percentage of A in the alloy and the given information about the weight percentages of α and β phases.

First, let's find the weight percentage of A in the β phase:

Weight percentage of A in β phase = 100% - Weight percentage of B in β phase = 100% - 20% = 80%

Next, we can use the given ratio of weight percentages of α and β phases to find the weight percentage of A in the α phase:

Weight percentage of A in α phase = Weight percentage of A in total / (Weight percentage of A in α + Weight percentage of A in β) = 70% / (70% + 20% * 4) = 70% / (70% + 80% * 2) = 70% / 350% = 0.2 or 20%

Now, we can find the weight percentage of B in the alloy:

Weight percentage of B in alloy = 100% - Weight percentage of A in alloy = 100% - (Weight percentage of A in α * (weight percentage of α / total weight percentage) + Weight percentage of A in β * (weight percentage of β / total weight percentage))

Weight percentage of B in alloy = 100% - (20% * (1/5) + 20% * (4/5)) = 100% - (20% * 0.2 + 20% * 0.8) = 100% - 40% = 60%

Explanation:

The mobility of atoms in the α matrix decreases with decreasing temperature, making it more difficult for atoms to move to their new positions in the growing β precipitates. Therefore, the rate of transformation initially decreases with increasing undercooling. However, at very large undercoolings, the thermodynamic driving force for the transformation becomes very large, which can overcome the decreased mobility of atoms and result in an increase in the rate of transformation.

The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is? (Round off to one decimal) ," To find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture, we need to use the given information and apply the lever rule.

First, let's find the mass fractions of A and B in each phase. Since phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B, and the atomic mass of A is twice that of B, the mass fraction of A in phase α is 1/3, and the mass fraction of B is 2/3.

In phase β, the mole fraction of A is twice that of B, so the mole fraction of A is xAβ = 2 * xBβ. Since the total number of moles of A and B in both phases is equal, we have:

Nα = NαA + NαB = NβA + NβB

Using the given information, we can write:

NαA = NβA = (1/3) * Nt * MwA
NαB = NβB = (2/3) * Nt * MwB

where Nt is the total number of moles in the two-phase mixture, and MwA and MwB are the molecular weights of A and B, respectively.

From the given information, we know that the total number of moles of A and B in both phases is equal, so:

Nt = NαA + NαB = NβA + NβB

Substituting the expressions for NαA, NαB, NβA, and NβB, we get:

Nt = (1/3) * MwA * Nt + (2/3) * MwB * Nt

Solving for Nt, we get:

Nt = 3 * (MwA * (1/3) + MwB * (2/3))

Now, we can find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture by using the lever rule:

xA = (NαA / (NαA + NβA)) = (Nα / (Nα + Nβ))

Substituting the expressions for Nα and Nβ in terms of Nt and the given information, we get:

xA = (1/2) * (1/3 + 2/3) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4

Therefore, the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is 0.25 or 25%.",,,0,

The lever rule states that the ratio of the masses of the reactants to the total mass is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the corresponding arms of a lever.

In this case, the reaction is:
γ (0.8 wt.% C) ↔ α (0.02 wt.% C) + $Fe_3C$ (6.67 wt.% C)

Let's denote the mass fraction of pearlite as x, the mass fraction of ferrite as y, and the mass fraction of cementite as z. We have:

x + y + z = 1

We also know that the mass fraction of carbon in pearlite is 6.67 wt.%, so the mass fraction of iron in pearlite is:

1 - 6.67 = 0.3333

The mass fraction of carbon in ferrite is 0.02 wt.%, so the mass fraction of iron in ferrite is:

1 - 0.02 = 0.98

Using the lever rule, we have:

(0.3333 / (0.3333 + y)) = (0.8 / (0.8 + 0.02 + 6.67))

Solving for y, we get:

y = 0.5821

Since the volume % of a phase is proportional to its mass %, we have:

x = 1 - y = 1 - 0.5821 = 0.4179

Therefore, the volume % of pearlite for the steel just below 723°C for 0.45 wt.% carbon steel is approximately 41.79%, which is closest to option C (40.9%).

The molar volumes of α and β phases are 7.377 $cm^3$ and 7.317 $cm^3$ , respectively. Assume that the difference in molar volumes of α and β is independent of pressure. The pressure (in atm) required for α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is (round off to nearest integer) "," To find the pressure required for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/P1) = ΔH/R(1/T2 - 1/T1)

where P1 = 1 atm = 1.01325 × $10^(5)$ Pa, T1 = 773 K, ΔH = 912 J $mol^(−1)$, and T2 = 723 K.

First, we need to convert the pressure to the same unit as the given pressure:

P2 = ? Pa

Now, we can calculate the ratio of the pressures:

ln(P2/P1) = ln(P2/1.01325 × $10^(5)$ Pa) = ln(P2/1.01325) + ln($10^(5)$)

Next, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find P2:

ln(P2/1.01325) = 912 J $mol^(−1)$/(8.314 J $mol^(−1)$ K^(−1))(1/723 K - 1/773 K)

Using a calculator, we can find:

ln(P2/1.01325) ≈ 0.0512

Now, we can find P2:

P2 = 1.01325 × $10^(5)$ Pa × e^0.0512 ≈ 1.062 × $10^(5)$ Pa

Finally, we can convert P2 to atm:

Molar volume of hcp Ti:

Explanation: In an Ellingham diagram, the slope of a line represents the change in entropy (ΔS°) for the reaction at standard state. For the reaction $C + O_2 = CO_2$, the volume change (ΔV) is zero because one volume of $CO_2$ gas is produced from one volume of $O_2$ gas. Since the net change in entropy is negligibly small (i.e., ΔS° = 0), the line for this reaction is nearly horizontal. However, the horizontal slope is not due to the enthalpy change or entropy change being zero, but rather because the entropy change for the formation of $CO_2$ from $C$ and $O_2$ is approximately the same as that for the formation of any other oxide from its corresponding metal and $O_2$. This is because the entropy change for the formation of an oxide primarily comes from the consumption of one mole of $O_2$ gas, which results in a decrease in disorder. Therefore, the lines for different metal oxides have similar slopes, making them nearly parallel to each other. The horizontal slope of the $C + O_2 = CO_2$ line indicates that carbon can reduce almost all metal oxides at temperatures above the points of intersection of the $C–CO_2$ line with these oxide lines, leading to the formation of $CO_2$ gas.",,,0,

In an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, the mass fraction of pearlilte just below the eutectoid temperature is? (answer up to two decimal places)"," To find the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature in an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, we need to use the lever rule and the phase diagram.

First, let's find the mole fractions of liquid and solid phases in equilibrium at the eutectoid temperature (0.8 wt.% C) using the lever rule.

Let xC be the mole fraction of carbon in the liquid phase and xS be the mole fraction of carbon in the solid phase (ferrite and cementite). We have:

xC + xS = 0.08 (1)

Since the carbon content in ferrite is 0.025 wt.%, its mole fraction is:

xS_Fe = 0.025 / (1 + 0.025) = 0.0235

The mole fraction of cementite can be found from the phase diagram or from the fact that the total carbon content in the solid phase is equal to the eutectoid composition:

xS_C = 0.08 - xS_Fe = 0.0565

Now we can find the mole fraction of liquid phase:

xC = 1 - xS = 1 - (xS_Fe + xS_C) = 0.9205

To find the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature, we need to find the mass fractions of ferrite and pearlite in the solid phase.

The mass fraction of ferrite is equal to its mole fraction:

w_Fe = xS_Fe * M_Fe / (M_Fe + M_C) = 0.0235 * 55.85 / (55.85 + 12.01) = 0.0195

The mass fraction of pearlite is the difference between the total mass fraction of solid phase and the mass fraction of ferrite:

w_P = 1 - w_Fe = 1 - 0.0195 = 0.9805

So, the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature in an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C is approximately 0.9805 or 98.05%.

φ(t) = 1 - exp(-kt^n)

We are given n = 2 and φ(100s) = 0.2. We need to find φ(400s).

First, we need to find the value of k. Since we don't have that information, we cannot directly calculate the transformation percentage after 400 seconds. However, we can rearrange the Avrami equation to solve for k given φ(t) and n:

ln[ln(1/(1-φ(t)))] = n * ln(t/t0) + ln(k)

where t0 is a reference time. We can use the given information to find t0:

ln[ln(1/(1-0.2))] = n * ln(100/t0) + ln(k)

Solving for k:

k = exp[ln[ln(5)] / n * ln(100) - ln(1-0.2)]

Now that we have k, we can find φ(400s):

ln[ln(1/(1-φ(400s)))] = n * ln(400/t0) + ln(k)

Solving for φ(400s):

φ(400s) = 1 - exp[-k * (400/t0)^n]

The volume of a unit cell can be calculated using the lattice parameter and the number of atoms in the unit cell.

For BCC phase:
Volume of unit cell = a³
Number of atoms in the unit cell = 2

So, Volume of BCC phase = (0.293 nm)³ × 2

For FCC phase:
Number of atoms in the unit cell = 4

So, Volume of FCC phase = (0.363 nm)³ × 4

Now, we can find the difference in volumes:

ΔV = V(FCC) - V(BCC)

Substituting the values:

ΔV = (0.363 nm)³ × 4 - (0.293 nm)³ × 2

Calculating the difference:

If liquid copper is cooled to 1353 K, magnitude of the driving force($J.mol^(-1)$) for liquid to transform to solid is?(round off to one decimal places)"," The driving force for liquid copper to transform to solid at a temperature of 1353 K is the difference in enthalpy between the liquid and solid states at that temperature. Since the given enthalpy of melting is for the melting temperature (1356 K), we need to find the enthalpy difference at 1353 K.

First, let's calculate the change in enthalpy for melting 1 mol of copper at the given melting temperature:

ΔH_m = 13 $KJ.mol^(-1)$

Now, we need to find the difference in enthalpy between the liquid and solid states at 1353 K. Since the constant pressure heat capacities of solid and liquid copper are assumed to be the same (24.0 J/(mol K)), we can use the difference in temperature to find the difference in enthalpy:

ΔH = ΔH_m + ΔH_s(T_f - T)

where ΔH_s is the change in enthalpy of solid copper from 1356 K to 1353 K, and T_f is the melting temperature.

To find ΔH_s, we can use the Legendre transformation, which allows us to find the change in enthalpy at constant temperature and pressure by considering the reversible transformation from the liquid to the solid at constant temperature, with the pressure changing from 1 bar (at the melting point) to zero (in the solid state). The change in enthalpy for this transformation is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P_2/P_1) = ΔH_m/R * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)

where P_1 and P_2 are the pressures, T_1 and T_2 are the temperatures, and R is the gas constant.

First, we need to find the pressure of solid copper at 1353 K. We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation with the given melting temperature and enthalpy of melting to find the vapor pressure of liquid copper at the melting point:

ln(P_1/1 bar) = ΔH_m/R * (1/T_f - 1/273.15 K)

Solving for P_1, we get:

P_1 ≈ 1.17 × 10^-11 bar

Now, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the pressure of solid copper at 1353 K:

ln(P_2/1.17 × 10^-11 bar) = ΔH_m/R * (1/1353 K - 1/1356 K)

Solving for P_2, we get:

P_2 ≈ 1.13 × 10^-12 bar

Now, we can find ΔH_s:

ΔH_s = ΔH_m + P_2 * V_m

where V_m is the molar volume of copper. Using the ideal gas law, we can find V_m:

V_m = RT/P_1 ≈ 6.51 × 10^-5 m^3/mol

The molar volume of solid copper at standard conditions (298K and 1 bar) is given as 6.022×1023 clusters/mol and its volume is 7×10−6$m^3$/mol. Therefore, the molar volume of solid copper is 6.022×1023 clusters/mol × (7×10−6$m^3$/mol) = 4.217×10−22$m^3$/mol.

The molar volume of liquid copper at its melting point (1358K) is not given in the text, so we cannot directly calculate its molar volume change. However, assuming that the difference in molar volumes between the liquid and solid phases is negligible, we can approximate /Delta1V∗ as 0.

Now, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the free energy change:

dT
dP/equal1T/Delta1V∗
/Delta1H∗

Since /Delta1V∗ is approximated as 0, the equation simplifies to:

dT
dP/equal1T/Delta1H∗

We can find the value of /Delta1H∗ from the given enthalpy of melting:

/Delta1H∗
Cu/equal113400 J $mol^(-1)$

Now, we need to find the temperature and pressure at which the free energy change is 1058K. We don't have the pressure value given, so we cannot directly calculate the free energy change. However, we can calculate the temperature at which the pressure is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure of solid copper at its melting point (1358K), and then use that temperature to find the free energy change.

The equilibrium vapor pressure of solid copper at its melting point can be found using the given equation for the equilibrium vapor pressure of solid Cu (ln(p1 bar) = −45,650/T + 0.306 ln T + 10.81):

ln(p1 bar)
=−45,650
T−0.306 ln T+10.81

Setting T = 1358K and solving for p1 bar, we get:

p1 bar/equal11.01×10−3 bar

Now, we can find the temperature at which the pressure is 1.01×10−3 bar using the given equation for the equilibrium vapor pressure of solid Cu:

ln(p)
=−45,650
T−0.306 ln T+10.81

Solving for T, we get:

T/equal11359 K

Now, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the free energy change at this temperature:

Phase transition,40,G-META-21-22,NUM,42,Given: Eutectoid composition: 0.8 wt.%C. Maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe: 0.025 wt.% C. A 0.6 wt.% C steel sample is slowly cooled from 900°C to room temperature. The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is?(round off to 2 decimal places). ," To determine the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure of a 0.6 wt.% C steel sample that is slowly cooled from 900°C to room temperature, we need to consider the phase diagram and the cooling conditions.

First, let's identify the phases present in the steel based on the given eutectoid composition and the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe:

1. Proeutectoid ferrite (α-Fe): This phase forms first when the austenite cools below the eutectoid temperature (Ae) of 727°C. The maximum carbon content for proeutectoid ferrite is 0.025 wt.%.
2. Austenite (γ-Fe): This phase contains carbon in solid solution. The maximum carbon content for austenite is 0.8 wt.%.
3. Cementite (Fe3C): This phase forms as a result of the eutectoid reaction between austenite and proeutectoid ferrite.

Now, let's determine the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite based on the cooling conditions:

Since the steel is slowly cooled from 900°C to room temperature, the transformation from austenite to pearlite (composed of ferrite and cementite) will occur. However, the question asks for the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite, which forms before the pearlite reaction begins.

From the TTT curve (Figure 8.18b), we can see that the amount of proeutectoid ferrite decreases as the isothermal transformation temperature is lowered. In this case, the cooling is not isothermal, but the rate is not specified. Generally, a slower cooling rate allows more time for proeutectoid ferrite to form.

Assuming a relatively slow cooling rate, the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite can be estimated based on the eutectoid composition and the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe:

1. The maximum carbon content for proeutectoid ferrite is 0.025 wt.%.
2. The carbon content of the steel is 0.6 wt.%.
3. The difference in carbon content between the steel and proeutectoid ferrite is 0.575 wt.%.

To find the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite, we can calculate the volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite based on the difference in carbon content and the difference in densities of the two phases:

1. The density of α-Fe is approximately 7.87 g/cm³.
2. The density of austenite is approximately 7.85 g/cm³.
3. The difference in densities is 0.02 g/cm³.

Using these values, we can calculate the volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite:

Volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = (mass of proeutectoid ferrite / total mass) * (density of proeutectoid ferrite / total density)

Mass of proeutectoid ferrite = (mass of steel) * (mass difference / total mass difference)

Total mass difference = (mass of steel) * (carbon content of steel - carbon content of proeutectoid ferrite) / (density of austenite - density of proeutectoid ferrite)

Mass difference = (mass of steel) * (0.6 wt.% - 0.025 wt.%) / (7.85 g/cm³ - 7.87 g/cm³)

Mass difference ≈ 0.000235 * (0.00575) / (0.0002) ≈ 0.011875 g/cm³

Volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite ≈ (0.011875 g/cm³ / (0.011875 g/cm³ + (mass of steel) g/cm³))

Volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite ≈ 0.011875 / (0.011875 + (mass of steel) / (cm³))

Electrical,1,G-XEC-2015-57-14,NUM,37,"A 1 kg sacrificial anode of Mg (atomic weight: 24.31 amu) is attached to the base of a ship. If the anode lasts for 60 days, what is the average corrosion current (in Amperes) during that period?"," To find the average corrosion current during the 60-day period, we first need to determine the mass loss of the Mg anode and then convert it to the equivalent current using the Faraday's law of electrolysis.

First, let's calculate the mass loss of the Mg anode:

Mass loss = Mass of anode (kg) × Time (days)
Mass loss = 1 kg × 60 days
Mass loss = 60 kg

Now, let's find the mass of Mg ions produced during the corrosion process. Since Mg has an atomic weight of 24.31 amu, we can convert it to grams:

1 amu = 1.66054 × 10^-24 g
24.31 amu = 3.9853 × 10^-22 g

Now, we can calculate the number of moles of Mg ions produced:

Moles of Mg ions = Mass loss (kg) / Atomic weight of Mg (g/mol)
Moles of Mg ions = 60 kg / 3.9853 × 10^-22 g/mol
Moles of Mg ions = 1.513 × 10^21

Next, we can find the number of Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol) worth of charges passed during the corrosion process:

Charges passed = Moles of Mg ions × Faraday constant
Charges passed = 1.513 × 10^21 × 96,485 C/mol
Charges passed = 1.46 × 10^14 C

Finally, we can convert the charges passed to current:

Current = Charges passed / Time (s)
Current = 1.46 × 10^14 C / (60 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour × 60 seconds/minute)
Current = 1.46 × 10^14 C / 3.1536 × 10^7 s
Current = 463,684 A

However, this value is much larger than the actual corrosion current. Since the anode is not delivering this current continuously, we need to find the average current during the 60-day period. We can assume that the anode is delivering a constant current until it is completely consumed. Let's assume that the anode is consumed uniformly over the 60-day period.

The total energy required to dissolve 1 kg of Mg is given by:

Energy = Mass of Mg (kg) × Enthalpy of fusion of Mg (J/kg)
Energy = 1 kg × 108.7 kJ/kg
Energy = 108.7 kJ

The energy required to pass 1 Coulomb of charge through a potential difference of 1 V is given by:

Energy = Charge (C) × Potential difference (V)
Energy = 1 C × 1 V
Energy = 1 J

We can find the energy required to dissolve 1 kg of Mg and pass the equivalent charge through an external circuit:

Total energy = Energy to dissolve Mg + Energy to pass charge
Total energy = 108.7 kJ + 1 J
Total energy = 108,701 J

The energy required to pass 1 Ampere of current for 1 second is given by:

Energy = Current (A) × Potential difference (V) × Time (s)
Energy = 1 A × 1 V × 1 s
Energy = 1 J

We can find the time required to pass the total energy:

Time = Total energy / Energy per second
Time = 108,701 J / 1 J
Time = 108,701 s

The average current during the 60-day period can be calculated as:

Average current = Total energy / (Current × Time)
Average current = 108,701 J / (1 A × 60 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour × 60 seconds/minute)
Average current = 1.51 A

The concentration(in micro molar) of $Ni^(2+)$ in the solution is "," To find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution, we can use the Nernst equation for the galvanic cell. The Nernst equation relates the potential difference between two electrodes to the concentration difference of the ions involved in the reaction.

First, we need to calculate the standard electrode potential difference between the two half cells:

$E_{cell}^{o} = E_{Ni}^{o} - E_{Cd}^{o} = -0.250 V - (-0.403 V) = 0.153 V$

Since the voltage of the cell is zero, the actual potential difference between the two electrodes is equal and opposite to the standard potential difference:

$E_{cell} = -E_{cell}^{o} = -0.153 V$

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions:

$E_{cell} = \frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{a_{Cd}}{a_{Ni}}\right)$

where $a_{Cd}$ is the activity of $Cd^{2+}$ ions in the reference electrode (which is 1 M), and $a_{Ni}$ is the activity of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the unknown solution. Since the temperature is 25°C, we can use the concentration instead of the activity:

$E_{cell} = \frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{C_{Cd}}{C_{Ni}}\right)$

where $C_{Cd}$ is the concentration of $Cd^{2+}$ ions in the reference electrode (1 M), and $C_{Ni}$ is the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the unknown solution.

We know that the voltage is zero, so the left side of the equation is zero:

$0 = \frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{C_{Cd}}{C_{Ni}}\right)$

To solve for $C_{Ni}$, we need to know the number of electrons transferred in the reaction ($n$). Since both Ni and Cd are divalent ions, $n = 2$.

$0 = \frac{RT}{2F}ln\left(\frac{C_{Cd}}{C_{Ni}}\right)$

$ln\left(\frac{C_{Cd}}{C_{Ni}}\right) = \frac{2F}{RT} \cdot 0$

$ln\left(\frac{C_{Cd}}{C_{Ni}}\right) = 0$

$C_{Cd} = C_{Ni}$

Since the concentration of $Cd^{2+}$ ions in the reference electrode is known (1 M), we can find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions by dividing both sides by the known concentration:

$C_{Ni} = \frac{C_{Cd}}{1} = 1 M = 1000 M$

To convert this to micro molar, we need to divide by 1,000,000:

$C_{Ni} = 1 \mu M$

Heating alone cannot increase the electrical conductivity of silicon significantly. It may increase the mobility of charge carriers but does not introduce new carriers.

Doping with arsenic increases the electrical conductivity of silicon by introducing free electrons, making it an n-type semiconductor.

Doping with aluminium introduces acceptor impurities, which create holes in the valence band and make the silicon p-type. However, it does not increase the electrical conductivity directly.

Exposure to light does not significantly affect the electrical conductivity of silicon unless it causes photogeneration of electron-hole pairs, which can contribute to conductivity if the material is doped or if there are defects or impurities present.

Hall effect measurement shows electron mobility to be 3.2 * $10^(-3)m^(2)V^(-1)s^(-1)$. Electrical resistivity of copper is 1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm. The average number of free electrons per atom in copper is ?," To find the average number of free electrons per atom in copper, we can use the given electrical resistivity and the free electron model of conductivity. The free electron model assumes that the conductivity is proportional to the number of free electrons per unit volume, their charge, and their mobility.

First, we need to find the resistivity in terms of the number of free electrons per unit volume and their mobility:

ρ = 1/σ = 1/(ne²μ)

where ρ is the resistivity, n is the number of free electrons per unit volume, and μ is the mobility.

Given that the resistivity of copper is 1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm, we can find the number of free electrons per unit volume:

n = ρ/(e²μ) = (1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm)/((1.6* $10^(-19)$ C)²(3.2* $10^(-3)$ m²V^(-1)s^(-1)))

Now, since there is one copper atom in the unit cell, we can find the average number of free electrons per atom by dividing the number of free electrons per unit volume by the number of atoms per unit cell:

N₀ = N/V = n/N₀a

where N₀ is the Avogadro constant, and N₀a is the number of atoms per unit cell.

Given that copper is an FCC metal with a lattice parameter of 3.62 Å, we can find the number of atoms per unit cell using the formula for the volume of an FCC unit cell:

V₀ = a³

where a is the lattice parameter.

Using the given lattice parameter, we can find the number of atoms per unit cell:

N₀a = V₀/a³ = (4/3)N₀(a/2)³

Now, we can find the average number of free electrons per atom:

The charge passed during the reaction is given as 48250 Coulombs. The Faraday constant is 96500 C/mole of electrons. Since there are 2 electrons involved in the reaction, the total charge for the reaction of 1 mole of Mg is 2 * 96500 C = 193000 C.

At ultraviolet frequencies, the electric field is changing its orientation so fast that even electrons fail to follow the field alternation, and thus the electronic contribution to polarization tends to vanish. In contrast, ionic polarization, which involves the movement of ions in response to an electric field, has a much slower response time and is therefore more significant in the infrared region. Dipolar polarizability, which arises from the alignment of permanent or induced dipoles in a material, is also less important at ultraviolet frequencies because the electric field is changing too rapidly for the dipoles to align effectively. Interfacial polarizability, which arises from the accumulation of charge at interfaces between materials, is not the primary contributor to the dielectric constant at ultraviolet frequencies.",,,0,

$0 = \frac{RT}{2F}ln\left(\frac{C_{Cd}}{C_{Ni}}\right)$

$ln\left(\frac{C_{Cd}}{C_{Ni}}\right) = \frac{2F}{RT} \cdot 0$

$ln\left(\frac{C_{Cd}}{C_{Ni}}\right) = 0$

$C_{Cd} = C_{Ni}$

Since the concentration of $Cd^{2+}$ ions in the reference electrode is known (1 M), we can find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions by dividing both sides by the known concentration:

$C_{Ni} = \frac{C_{Cd}}{1} = 1 M = 1000 M$

where E°cell is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and Q is the reaction quotient.

First, we need to calculate the standard cell potential, E°cell, using the standard electrode potentials for copper:

E°Cathode = -0.34 V
E°Anode = +0.34 V

Since the overall reaction is a displacement reaction, the standard cell potential is the difference between the standard electrode potentials:

E°cell = E°Cathode - E°Anode = -0.34 V - (+0.34 V) = -0.68 V

Next, we need to calculate the reaction quotient, Q, using the given activity of impure copper, $𝑎_(𝐶𝑢)$:

Q = $𝑎_(𝐶𝑢)$^2

Now, we can calculate the voltage required for electrolytic refining by setting the cell potential equal to the applied voltage:

Ecell = Eapplied

Eapplied = -0.68 V - 0.000511 * ln($𝑎_(𝐶𝑢)$^2)

A galvanic cell is formed by connecting Zn($E°_(Zn^(+2)/Zn)$ = -0.76 V) and Fe($E°_(Fe^(+2)/Fe)$ = -0.44 V) wires immersed in their respective ion solutions. The cell discharges spontaneoulsy with a voltage of 0.5V. The ratio of the concentration of $[Fe^(+2)]$ to $[Zn^(+2)]$ ions in the cell is of the order of:  (A) $10^(-6)$ (B) $10^(-5)$ (C) $10^(6)$ (D) $10^(7)$"," To find the ratio of the concentration of $[Fe^{2+}]$ to $[Zn^{2+}]$ ions, we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the electrode potential of a half-cell to the concentration of the ions in the solution.

First, we need to calculate the electrode potential of each half-cell when the ions are at their standard concentration (unit activity). We are given the standard electrode potentials for both Zn and Fe.

$E°_{Zn^{2+}/Zn} = -0.76 V$
$E°_{Fe^{2+}/Fe} = -0.44 V$

The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials of the two half-cells:

$E_{cell} = E°_{Fe^{2+}/Fe} - E°_{Zn^{2+}/Zn} = -0.44 V - (-0.76 V) = 0.32 V$

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the ratio of the concentrations of $[Fe^{2+}]$ to $[Zn^{2+}]$ at the given cell potential:

$E_{cell} = E°_{cell} + \frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]}\right)$

We are given $R$, $F$, $T$, and $E_{cell}$. We need to solve for $\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]}$.

First, we can find $E°_{cell}$:

$E°_{cell} = E°_{Fe^{2+}/Fe} - E°_{Zn^{2+}/Zn} = -0.44 V - (-0.76 V) = 0.32 V$

Now, we can rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for $\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]}$:

$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} = e^{\frac{nF}{RT}(E_{cell} - E°_{cell})}$

Substituting the given values:

$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} = e^{\frac{(2)(96500 C.mol^{-1})}{(8.314 J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1})(298 K)}(0.32 V - 0.32 V)}$

The exponential term is equal to 1, since the difference in potentials is zero. Therefore, the ratio of the concentrations is equal to 1.

However, this result is not consistent with the given options. Let's try to find an approximate value for the ratio of the concentrations by assuming that the difference in potentials is small enough to neglect the exponential term in the Nernst equation. In this case, we can approximate the ratio of the concentrations as:

$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \approx e^{\frac{nF}{RT}E_{cell}}$

Substituting the given values:

$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \approx e^{\frac{(2)(96500 C.mol^{-1})}{(8.314 J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1})(298 K)}(0.32 V)}$

Calculating the value:

$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \approx 10^{0.012} \approx 1.012$

Since the ratio of the concentrations is very close to 1, it is unlikely that the given cell potential corresponds to a large difference in the concentrations of $[Fe^{2+}]$ and $[Zn^{2+}]$ ions. Therefore, it is unlikely that the answer is any of the given options.

It is possible that there is an error in the given cell potential or that the cell contains impurities or other factors that affect the concentrations of the ions. In practice, it is important to carefully control the conditions in a galvanic cell to ensure that the concentrations of the ions remain constant and that the cell potential is measured accurately.",,,0,

Iron is corroding in fresh water which has dissolved oxygen concentration of 15mM. The anodic current density(in $A.cm^(-2)$) at an overpotential of 120 mV is?(round off to three decimal places).," To calculate the anodic current density at an overpotential of 120 mV for iron corroding in fresh water, we can use the following equation:

i = i0 * exp(β * η)

where i is the current density, i0 is the exchange current density, η is the overpotential, and β is the Tafel slope.

First, we need to calculate the exchange current density using the given Tafel slope and the diffusion coefficient of oxygen.

i0 = D * (n * F / RT) * (C * exp(-ΔGad / RT))

where D is the diffusion coefficient, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and ΔGad is the standard free energy change for the anodic reaction.

For the anodic reaction of iron in water, the standard free energy change is -0.034 eV or -0.034 * 1.602 * 10^-19 J/electron.

Assuming a temperature of 25°C (298.15 K), we can calculate the exchange current density as follows:

i0 = 2.42 * 10^-5 * (2 * 1.602 * 10^-19 / (8.314 * 298.15)) * (15 * 10^-3 * 10^-3 * exp(-(-0.034 * 1.602 * 10^-19 / (8.314 * 298.15)))

i0 = 1.12 * 10^-11 A/cm^2

Now we can calculate the current density at an overpotential of 120 mV using the Tafel equation:

η = log(i / i0) / β

i = i0 * exp(β * η)

i = 1.12 * 10^-11 * exp(0.06 * 120 * 10^-3)

i = 1.12 * 10^-11 * exp(0.072)

2. Number of phosphorus atoms per unit volume:
Residual P content = 0.1 parts per billion by weight

= 1 * $10^(-9) g.cm^(-3)
Number of phosphorus atoms per unit volume = (1 * $10^(-9) g.cm^(-3)) * (6.02 * $10^(23) atoms.g^(-1))

First, let's find the standard electrode potential (E°) for the iron reduction reaction using the given data:

E° = -RT ln(I0 / (nF)

where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, I0 is the exchange current density, and n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction.

E° = -(8.314 J/mol K) × (298 K) × ln(10^(-9) A/cm^2 / (2 × 96500 C/mol))
E° ≈ -0.442 V

Next, we can find the corrosion potential (V) using the Tafel equation:

η = b log(j / j0)

where η is the overpotential, j is the corrosion current density, and j0 is the exchange current density.

We are given the corrosion current density (j) and the exchange current density (j0). We can find the overpotential (η) by rearranging the Tafel equation:

η = b log(j / j0)
η = 0.1 V/decade × log(4 µA/cm^2 / 10^(-9) A/cm^2)
η ≈ 0.52 decades × 3 × log(10^3)
η ≈ 0.52 × 3 × 3 = 0.606 V

Finally, we can find the corrosion potential (V) by subtracting the overpotential (η) from the standard electrode potential (E°):

V = E° - η
V = -0.442 V - 0.606 V
V ≈ -1.048 V (rounded off to 2 decimal places)",,,0,

The overall reaction is:

If the height of the green sample was 12 mm, then the fill height of powder (in mm) would have been?"," To find the fill height of the powder, we first need to determine the volume of the green compact and the volume of the powder that was added to the die.

The volume of the green compact can be calculated using its dimensions:

Volume of green compact = π * (diameter / 2)² * height
Volume of green compact = π * (2 * 0.015 m)² * 0.012 m
Volume of green compact = 0.0001131 m³

The density of the green compact is given as 5.5 g/$cm^3$, so we can convert this to kg/$m^3$ and find its mass:

Mass of green compact = Volume of green compact * Green density
Mass of green compact = 0.0001131 m³ * 5500 kg/$m³
Mass of green compact = 0.0633 kg

Since the apparent density of the powder is 2.5 g/$cm^3$, we can find its volume and then subtract the volume of the green compact to find the volume of the added powder:

Volume of powder = Mass of green compact / Green density
Volume of powder = 0.0633 kg / 5500 kg/$m^3$
Volume of powder = 0.0001152 m³

The difference between the volume of the green compact and the volume of the powder gives us the volume of the powder that was added to the die:

Volume of added powder = Volume of green compact - Volume of powder
Volume of added powder = 0.0001131 m³ - 0.0001152 m³
Volume of added powder = -0.0000021 m³

This result indicates that there is a mistake in the problem statement, as the volume of the added powder cannot be negative. It's likely that the green density was meant to be 5.5 g/$cm^3$ instead of 5500 kg/$m^3$.

Assuming the correct green density, we can calculate the fill height of the powder:

The mass of the powder that was added to the die can be calculated using its density and volume:

Mass of powder = Volume of added powder * Apparent density
Mass of powder = -0.0000021 m³ * 2500 kg/$m^3$
Mass of powder = -0.000000525 kg

Since the mass of the powder cannot be negative, there is an error in the problem statement. It's likely that the green density was meant to be 2.5 g/$cm^3$ instead of 5.5 g/$cm^3$.

Assuming the correct green density, we can calculate the fill height of the powder:

Mass of powder = Volume of added powder * Apparent density
Mass of powder = -0.0000021 m³ * 2500 kg/$m^3$
Mass of powder = -0.000000525 kg

The mass of the green compact is 0.0633 kg, so the mass of the powder that was not compacted and was ejected from the die is:

Mass of ejected powder = Mass of green compact - Mass of compacted powder
Mass of ejected powder = 0.0633 kg - Mass of compacted powder

To find the mass of the compacted powder, we can use the volume of the green compact and its density:

Mass of compacted powder = Volume of green compact * Green density
Mass of compacted powder = 0.0001131 m³ * 5500 kg/$m^3$
Mass of compacted powder = 0.0633 kg

Mass of ejected powder = 0.0633 kg - 0.0633 kg = 0 kg

This result indicates that no powder was ejected from the die, which is not possible. It's likely that the problem statement contains errors.

Therefore, we cannot determine the fill height of the powder based on the given information.",,,0,

Explanation:

Grain size strengthening (P) is typically achieved by reducing the grain size, which increases the density of grain boundaries and makes it harder for dislocations to move through them. This mechanism is often referred to as grain boundary strengthening.

Work hardening (Q) is a process that increases the strength of a material by deforming it, which increases the density of dislocations and makes it harder for more dislocations to move through the material.

Dispersion strengthening (R) is a process that involves adding small, evenly distributed particles to a material to impede the movement of dislocations. This can be achieved through mechanisms such as Orowan looping, where dislocations must loop around the particles, or Lomer-Cottrell barriers, where the particles pin dislocations and prevent them from moving.

Solid solution hardening (S) is a process that involves adding solute atoms to a base metal to increase its strength. This can be achieved through mechanisms such as Suzuki interaction, where the solute atoms interact with the dislocations and make it harder for them to move, or by increasing the stacking fault energy, which makes it harder for dislocations to form and move.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) P-4, Q-3, R-1, S-2. Grain size strengthening (P) is associated with the mechanism of grain boundary strengthening (S-2), work hardening (Q) is associated with the mechanism of dislocation interaction (Q-3), dispersion strengthening (R) is associated with the mechanism of dislocation looping around particles (R-1), and solid solution hardening (S) is associated with the mechanism of solute atoms interacting with dislocations (S-1).",,,0,

However, the reason (r) is not the only reason for using DCRP in aluminium welding. While it is true that DCRP helps in breaking up the oxide film on the workpiece surface, there are other reasons for its use as well. For instance, DCRP helps in reducing the risk of porosity in the weld, which is a common issue in aluminium welding.

The elastic modulus of a material is a fundamental material property that is not directly related to its hardness. While it is true that the coarse grained microstructure in the HAZ of a weld can result in lower hardness compared to the base metal, it does not necessarily mean that the elastic modulus in the HAZ is the same as that in the base metal. In fact, changes in microstructure, such as the formation of new phases or the presence of residual stresses, can lead to significant variations in elastic modulus within the HAZ.

The density of the as-pressed aluminium compact is 1755 kg.$m^(-3)$. If the height of the as-pressed compact is 12 mm, the fill height (in mm) required is?"," To find the fill height of the aluminium compact, we need to use the given information and the relationship between the applied pressure, density, and height of the compact.

First, let's find the porosity of the compact:

Porosity = (Apparent density - Compact density) / Apparent density

Porosity = (810 kg.m⁻³ - 1755 kg.m⁻³) / 810 kg.m⁻³
Porosity = 0.795

Now, we can use the given relationship between the applied pressure, density, and height of the compact (Equation 3-17) to find the fill height:

Px/Pa = 1 - (1 - (Pc/pf)ⁱn)ⁱZ

where:
Px = pressure at a given depth in the compact
Pa = applied pressure
Pc = compact density
pf = fill density
n = compaction constant
Z = radial-to-axial pressure ratio

We are given Pc, pf, Pa, and Z, and we want to find h (fill height). We can rearrange Equation 3-17 to solve for h:

h = (1/Z) * [(Pa/Pc)ⁱn - 1] / (1 - (Pc/pf)ⁱn)

Substituting the given values:

h = (1/0.5) * [(600 MPa/1755 kg.m⁻³)ⁱn - 1] / (1 - (1755 kg.m⁻³/810 kg.m⁻³)ⁱn)

We don't have a value for the compaction constant n, so we cannot directly calculate the fill height. However, we can calculate the fill height for different values of n and find the one that gives the correct answer.

For example, if we assume n = 0.5, we get:

h = (1/0.5) * [(600 MPa/1755 kg.m⁻³)⁰.5 - 1] / (1 - (1755 kg.m⁻³/810 kg.m⁻³)⁰.5)
h = 12.1 mm

This value is close to the given height of the as-pressed compact (12 mm), so n = 0.5 might be a reasonable assumption. However, to find the exact value, we would need more information or experimental data.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 12.1 mm, with an assumption of n = 0.5.",,,0,

Explanation:

Brazing is a joining process that uses a filler metal to melt and flow into the gap between two metal surfaces, forming a metallic bond. The filler metal should have a lower melting point than the base metals to ensure that the base metals do not melt during the brazing process.

Steel sheets are commonly brazed using near-eutectic alloys, which have a composition that is close to the eutectic point of the base metals. These alloys have a low melting point and good wettability with the base metals, making them ideal for brazing applications.

Epoxy resins are not suitable for brazing as they are organic materials and do not melt or flow like metals. Refractory alloys have high melting points and are not typically used as brazing filler metals. Large freezing range alloys have a wide range of melting temperatures and may not provide consistent results during brazing.",,,0,

Sand casting is known to produce castings with a naturally rough surface finish due to the presence of embedded sand particles. Permanent mold casting results in a smoother surface finish compared to sand casting, but it may still have some roughness due to the use of a permanent mold. Pressure die casting produces the smoothest surface finish among the given processes due to the use of a metal die and the application of high pressure during the casting process. Investment casting, on the other hand, can produce castings with very fine surface finishes, especially when using lost wax or other advanced techniques.

Energy input per unit length = Power input / Traverse speed
Energy input per unit length = 4800 W / (5 𝑚𝑚.$𝑠^(−1)$ )

(C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains. (D) recrytallize at lower temeperatures," (D) recrystallize at lower temperatures.

Explanation: According to the context provided, a heavily cold-worked metal will have a higher driving force for recrystallization due to the increased dislocation density and strain energy stored in the lattice. This means that the energy required to initiate recrystallization is lower for a heavily cold-worked metal compared to an annealed or less deformed metal. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.

Option (C) is also incorrect because a higher driving force for recrystallization actually facilitates the nucleation of new grains, not creates a higher energy barrier for it.

Finally, option (A) is incorrect because a heavily cold-worked metal will recrystallize into a finer grained microstructure as compared to its less deformed counterpart, not a coarser one.

* Fe-20 wt.% Cr-5 wt.% Ni: 5 wt.% of 20% of the total mass = 1 wt.% of the total mass

Next, let's calculate the Ni contribution from the filler rod:

* 20wt.% Ni-80 wt.% Cr: 20 wt.% of 20% of the total mass = 0.4 × 20 = 8 wt.% of the total mass

The welding current determines the amount of heat generated at the tip of the electrode, which in turn affects the melting rate of the wire. A higher welding current results in a faster melting rate. The diameter of the consumable wire also affects the melting rate, as a larger diameter wire will melt more quickly due to its larger cross-sectional area.

(round off to the nearest integer). "," To find the welding current of the second weld, we need to keep the heat input constant between the two welds. We can use the formula for heat input in Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW):

Heat input (E) = (Current (I) × Voltage (U) × Welding speed (v)) / 1000

Since the welding speed and arc voltage are the same for both welds, we can set up an equation:

(I1 × 18 × 0.002) = (I2 × 18 × 0.0022)

To solve for I2, we can first simplify the equation:

I1 × 0.002 = I2 × 0.0022

Now, divide both sides by 0.002:

I1 = 1.1 × I2

Since the arc heat transfer efficiency is 0.65, we need to account for that in our calculation. The actual heat input for each weld is:

Heat input1 = (I1 × 18 × 0.002) / 0.65
Heat input2 = (I2 × 18 × 0.0022) / 0.65

Since both heat inputs are equal, we can set up another equation:

(I1 × 18 × 0.002) / 0.65 = (I2 × 18 × 0.0022) / 0.65

Now, we can solve for I2:

I1 / I2 = 1.1
I2 = I1 / 1.1

Find the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$," To find the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient of copper in aluminium is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$, we can use the Arrhenius equation:

D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)

where D is the diffusion coefficient, D0 is the frequency factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given the values of D at 400K and 500K. We can rearrange the equation to solve for T:

ln(D/D0) = -Q/R * (1/T)

First, we need to find the value of D0. Since we don't have that information, we can't directly calculate the temperature. However, we can use the given values of D at 400K and 500K to estimate D0.

We can assume that the ratio of D at 400K to D at 500K is equal to the ratio of the exponentials in the Arrhenius equation:

(D400/D500) = exp[-(Q/R)(1/T400 - 1/T500)]

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides and simplify:

ln(D400/D500) = -Q/R * (1/T400 - 1/T500)

We can use the given values of D400 and D500 to find the value of Q/R:

Q/R = -ln(D400/D500) / (1/T400 - 1/T500)

Once we have the value of Q/R, we can use the Arrhenius equation to find the temperature at which D = $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$:

ln($10^(-16)$ / D0) = -Q/R * (1/T)

Solving for T:

T = -R/Q * ln($10^(-16)$ / D0)

We don't have the value of D0, so we cannot directly calculate the temperature. However, we can use an iterative method to estimate the temperature. We can guess a value of D0 and use the Arrhenius equation to calculate the corresponding temperature.

For example, we can start by guessing a value of D0 that is between D400 and D500. Let's say D0 = $10^(-21)$ $m^2s^(-1)$. Using the Arrhenius equation, we can calculate the corresponding temperature:

T = -R/Q * ln($10^(-16)$ / $10^(-21)$)

If the temperature is not close enough to the desired value, we can adjust D0 and repeat the calculation until we find a temperature that gives us the desired diffusion coefficient.

First, let's find the ratio of the diffusion coefficients at 400 °C and 500 °C:

D(400 °C) / D(500 °C) = 5*$10^(-14) m^2s^(-1) / 6*$10^(-13) m^2s^(-1) = 8.33

Now, let's assume that the concentration of copper at the given depth in both experiments is the same, denoted as C. We can write the equation for the amount of copper diffused at each temperature as:

N(400 °C) = C * 5*$10^(-14) m^2s^(-1) * 100 hours
N(500 °C) = C * 6*$10^(-13) m^2s^(-1) * t hours

Since N(400 °C) = N(500 °C), we can set these expressions equal to each other and solve for t:

C * 5*$10^(-14) m^2s^(-1) * 100 hours = C * 6*$10^(-13) m^2s^(-1) * t hours

The activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al in kJ/mol is," To find the activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al, we can use the Arrhenius equation:

D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)

where D is the diffusion coefficient, D0 is the frequency factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We have two measurements of D at different temperatures. We can rearrange the Arrhenius equation to find Q:

ln(D1/D2) = ln(D0) - (Q/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)

where D1 and D2 are the diffusion coefficients at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively.

Substituting the given values:

ln(5.8*10^(-13) / 1.9*10^(-13)) = ln(D0) - (Q/R)(1/550 - 1/500)

Solving for Q:

Q = R * ln(5.8*10^(-13) / 1.9*10^(-13)) / (1/550 - 1/500)

Using the value of R = 8.314 J/mol*K:

Q = 1.11 * 10^4 J/mol

First, we need to find the diffusion length ($L$) of gallium in silicon at the given temperature using the given diffusion coefficient ($D$). The diffusion length is given by:

$$L = \sqrt{D \cdot t}$$

We want the concentration at a depth of $L$ to be one half the surface concentration ($C_s$), so we can set up the following equation:

$$C(L,t) = \frac{C_s}{2}$$

Using Fick's second law of diffusion, we have:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \cdot \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$$

Assuming one-dimensional diffusion in the $x$ direction, we can solve this equation using the method of separation of variables. The solution is:

$$C(x,t) = \frac{C_s}{2} \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{2 \cdot \sqrt{D \cdot t}}\right)$$

We want $C(L,t) = \frac{C_s}{2}$, so we can set up the following equation:

$$\frac{C_s}{2} = \frac{C_s}{2} \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{L}{2 \cdot \sqrt{D \cdot t}}\right)$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $t$, we get:

$$t = \frac{L^2}{4 \cdot D} = \frac{(10^{-3} \text{ cm})^2}{4 \cdot (6 \cdot 10^{-11} \text{ cm}^2 \cdot \text{s}^(-1))} = 1.25 \cdot 10^(11) \text{ s} \approx 398,110 \text{ s}$$

Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer)"," To find the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel, we need to use the Nernst equation and the given data.

First, let's find the reduction potential of the nickel/hydrogen half-cell reaction:

E°(Ni/H2) = -0.25 V

Next, we need to convert the potential to volts:

E°(Ni/H2) = -0.25 V × 1.602 × 10^-19 J/V × 10^-3 J/C × 10^3 C/mol = -4.51 × 10^-19 J/mol

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion:

E = E° + (RT/nF)ln(Q)

where E is the equilibrium potential, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and F is Faraday's constant.

We want to find the partial pressure of hydrogen, so we need to rearrange the equation to solve for pH2:

pH2 = pHg - log(Q)

where pHg is the standard hydrogen potential, which is 0 at 298 K.

First, let's calculate Q:

Q = [Ni2+]^(n/2) [H+]^n / [H2]^n

We are given [Ni2+] = 0.06 M and pH = 4, so we need to find [H+].

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

where pKa is the acid dissociation constant for nickel chloride, which is 7.5.

pH = 7.5 + log([Ni2+]/[NiCl2])

We don't have a value for [NiCl2], but we can assume that it is much larger than [Ni2+] since nickel chloride is a strong ionizer. Therefore, we can approximate [NiCl2] as a constant and solve for [Ni2+]:

pH = 7.5 + log([Ni2+]/Ka)

4 = 7.5 + log([Ni2+]/1.2 × 10^-7)

Log([Ni2+]) = 3.14 - log(1.2 × 10^-7)

[Ni2+] = 1.1 × 10^-3 M

Now we can calculate Q:

Q = (1.1 × 10^-3)^(2/2) (1 × 10^-14)^1 / (1 × 10^-1)^1

Q = 1.2 × 10^-3

Now we can find the partial pressure of hydrogen:

pH2 = 0 - log(1.2 × 10^-3)

pH2 = 3.01 × 10^-3 atm

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is 0.

However, this answer is not physically meaningful since the partial pressure of hydrogen cannot be negative or less than zero.

The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer). ," To solve the problem, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion, which relates the concentration gradient and the diffusion flux to the diffusion coefficient and time. The given information provides the diffusion coefficient (D) and the initial and boundary conditions (Ci and Cs). We need to find the time (t) required to achieve a certain carbon concentration (Cf) at a specific depth (x).

First, we need to convert the weight percentages to molar concentrations. The molar mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol, and the mass density of iron is 7.87 g/cm³.

Ci = 0.1 wt% × 12.01 g/mol / (7.87 g/cm³ × 100%) = 0.000852 mol/cm³
Cs = 1.0 wt% × 12.01 g/mol / (7.87 g/cm³ × 100%) = 0.0101 mol/cm³

Next, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion to find the concentration profile (C) as a function of depth (x) and time (t). The equation for one-dimensional diffusion is:

∂C/∂t = D ∂²C/∂x²

Assuming a steady-state diffusion profile, we can integrate this equation twice to obtain:

C(x,t) = Ci + (Cs - Ci) erfc[(x - x0) / (2√(Dt))]

where x0 is the initial position (x = 0 at the surface). We want to find the time required to achieve a carbon concentration of 0.46 mol/cm³ at a depth of 5 mm. We can set up the equation as follows:

0.46 mol/cm³ = 0.000852 mol/cm³ + (0.0101 mol/cm³ - 0.000852 mol/cm³) erfc[(5 mm - 0) / (2√(Dt))]

Solving for t requires numerical methods or approximations. We can use the error function table values from the image to estimate the time. We can assume that erfc(z) ≈ 1 - erf(z) for small z, and we can approximate z as follows:

z = (5 mm - 0) / (2√(Dt))

We can solve for t iteratively by setting z equal to successively smaller values and looking up the corresponding erf(z) and erfc(z) values in the table until we find a good approximation for t.

Using the given value of D, we can estimate the time as follows:

z = (5 mm) / (2√(6.0*$10^(-11)m^(2).s^(-1) × t))
erf(z) ≈ 0.01
erfc(z) ≈ 0.99

0.46 mol/cm³ = 0.000852 mol/cm³ + (0.0101 mol/cm³ - 0.000852 mol/cm³) erfc(z)
0.46 mol/cm³ ≈ 0.0101 mol/cm³ × 0.99
0.0091 mol/cm³ ≈ 0.0101 mol/cm³ × 0.99
0.0091 mol/cm³ ≈ 0.009 mol/cm³

0.009 mol/cm³ = 0.0101 mol/cm³ × 0.99 - 0.000852 mol/cm³

$x^2$ = $2*D_A*t$

We are given the diffusion length ($x$ = 10 μm = 10^-6 m) and want to find the time ($t$). Rearrange the equation:

$t$ = $x^2$ / ($2*D_A$)

Substitute the known value of $x$ and the calculated value of $D_A$:

$t$ = $(10^-6m)^2$ / ($2*(D_A)°*exp(-{0.0387})$)

To find the time at 600 K, we need to calculate the value of $D_A$ at that temperature.

$D_A$ = $(D_A)°*exp(-{0.0387})$

Now, substitute this value back into the equation for time:

$t$ = $(10^-6m)^2$ / ($2*(D_A)°*exp(-{0.0387})^2$)

Calculate the value of $D_A$ at 300 K:

$D_A$ = $(D_A)°*exp(-{0.0387})$

Now, we can find the time it takes for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 300 K:

$t$ = $(10^-6m)^2$ / ($2*(D_A)°*exp(-{0.0387})^2$)

Since we know the time it takes for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 300 K, we can find the ratio of the times at 600 K and 300 K:

$t_{600K}/t_{300K}$ = $(D_A)_{300K}/(D_A)_{600K}$

Substitute the known value of $t_{300K}$ and calculate the ratio:

We know that it takes 10 hours to homogenize the alloy at 1273 K, so we can set $x$ equal to the size of the alloy and $t$ equal to 10 hours, and solve for $D_{1273K}$:

$10h = \frac{x^2}{D_{1273K}}$

At 300°C and $P_(H_2)$ = 1 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd is 1.64 * $10^(4)mm^(3)$ (STP) per kg of Pd. At 300°C and $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd in $mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd is? (answer up to one decimal place)"," To find the solubility of hydrogen in Pd at $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm, we can use Sievert's law, which states that the concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the square root of the partial pressure of the gas in the contacting atmosphere.

First, we need to find the solubility of hydrogen in Pd at standard conditions (1 atm). We are given that at 300°C and 1 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd is 1.64 * $10^(4)mm^(3)$ (STP) per kg of Pd.

Using Sievert's law, we have:

[H] = Kp * sqrt(P)

where [H] is the solubility of hydrogen in Pd, Kp is the solubility constant, and P is the partial pressure of hydrogen.

At standard conditions, P = 1 atm, so:

1.64 * $10^(4)mm^(3)$ = Kp * sqrt(1)

Solving for Kp:

Kp = (1.64 * $10^(4))^2
Kp = 2.72 * $10^(8) M

Now, we want to find the solubility of hydrogen in Pd at $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm. Using Sievert's law again:

[H] = Kp * sqrt(0.09)

Solving for [H]:

[H] = 2.72 * $10^(8) M * sqrt(0.09)
[H] = 1.12 * $10^(4) M

To convert from moles to $mm^(3)$ (STP), we can use the ideal gas law:

$mm^(3)$ (STP) = (22.414 * 10^3 L) * (1 mole) / (1 kg) * (1 mole) / (1 L) * (1.12 * $10^(4) M)

$mm^(3)$ (STP) = 2.58 * $10^(5)

So, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd at $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm is approximately 2.58 * $10^(5) mm^(3)$ (STP) per kg of Pd. (Answer: 2.6 * $10^(5) mm^(3)$)",,,0,

Transport phenomena,19,G-META-18-25,NUM,54,Given: The interdiffusion coefficient for copper in aluminium at 500°C and 600°C are 4*$10^(-14)$ $m^(2)s^(-1)$ and 8 * $10^(-13)m^(2)s^(-1)$. A copper-aluminium diffusion couple develops a certain concentration profile after an isothermal treatment at 600°C for 10 hours. The time(in hours to 1 decimal place) required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is," To find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C, we can use the relationship between the interdiffusion coefficient and temperature, as well as Fick's second law of diffusion.

First, let's find the ratio of the interdiffusion coefficients at 500°C and 600°C:

D500/D600 = (D500)²/(D600)²

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging:

ln(D500/D600) = ln(D500²/D600²) = ln(D500)² - ln(D600)²

Using the given values, we have:

ln(D500/D600) = ln((4*10^(-14))²/(8*10^(-13))²) = ln(64/6400) = ln(0.01) = -2.2115

Now, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion to find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C. The general form of Fick's second law is:

∂C/∂t = D ∂²C/∂x²

where C is the concentration, D is the interdiffusion coefficient, and x is the spatial position.

We can assume that the initial concentration is zero and the boundary conditions are symmetric, so the solution for the concentration profile is given by:

C(x,t) = (Cs/2)[1 - erf((x - xj)/(2√(Dt)))]

where Cs is the surface concentration, xj is the junction depth, and erf is the error function.

Since we want to find the time required to achieve a certain concentration profile, we can set the concentration at a certain position equal to a fraction of the surface concentration:

C(x,t) = Cs/2 * f

where f is the fraction of the surface concentration.

Solving for t, we get:

t = (x - xj)²/(4D)

At the given position, we have:

x = xj = 10^-3 cm = 10^-7 m

We want to find the time required to achieve a concentration of 0.5 * Cs at this position, so we set f = 0.5:

C(x,t) = Cs/2 * 0.5 = Cs/4

Substituting the given value of Cs = 1, we get:

C(x,t) = 1/4

Now, we can solve for t:

t = (x - xj)²/(4D)

t = (10^-7 - xj)²/(4*D)

Since we don't know the junction depth xj, we can't directly find the time. However, we can find the time ratio between 500°C and 600°C using the given interdiffusion coefficients:

t500/t600 = (D600)²/(D500)²

Using the given values, we have:

t500/t600 = (8*10^(-13))²/(4*10^(-14))² = 1024

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is 1024 times longer than at 600°C:

t500 = 1024 * 10 hours = 10,240 hours

So, the answer is 10,240 hours.",,,0,

Assume [$h_N$]= [wt.%N], where [$h_N$] N h is the activity of nitrogen with respect to 1 wt.% Henrian standard state. Equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen (in wt.%, rounded off to three decimal places) in pure liquid iron, exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K, is?"," To find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron at 1873 K, we need to use Sieverts' law and the given Sieverts' law constant as a function of temperature.

First, we need to calculate the value of $log_(10)K_[N]$ at 1873 K:

$log_(10)K_[N]$ = [-518/1873 - 1.063]
$log_(10)K_[N]$ = [-0.273 - 1.063]
$log_(10)K_[N]$ = -1.336

Now, we can use Sieverts' law to find the equilibrium concentration of nitrogen:

$log_[h_N]$ = $log_(10)K_[N]$ + $log_[1\%N]$
$log_[h_N]$ = -1.336 + $log_[1\%N]$

To find $log_[1\%N]$, we can use the definition of the activity coefficient in terms of the fugacity and the fugacity of the pure component:

$log_[1\%N]$ = $log_{10}(f_{N}/f_{N}^{0})$

Since the pure liquid iron is the solvent, the activity of nitrogen with respect to the 1 wt.% Henrian standard state is equal to its fugacity in the pure liquid iron divided by its fugacity in the standard state. The fugacity of nitrogen in the pure liquid iron can be calculated using the ideal gas law:

$f_{N}$ = $P_{N}$/$RT$

The partial pressure of nitrogen in atmospheric air is approximately 0.001 bar, so we can assume that the nitrogen is in an ideal gas state in the air and use the ideal gas law to find its fugacity:

$f_{N}^{0}$ = $P_{N}^{0}$/$RT$

$P_{N}^{0}$ is the vapor pressure of nitrogen at the temperature of interest, which can be found from a thermodynamic data book or a database. For example, at 1873 K, the vapor pressure of nitrogen is approximately 0.033 bar.

$log_[1\%N]$ = $log_{10}(0.001/(0.033/RT))$

To find the equilibrium concentration of nitrogen, we need to solve for $h_N$:

$h_N$ = 10^($log_[h_N]$ + 1)
$h_N$ = 10^(-1.336 + $log_[1\%N]$ + 1)

Substituting the value of $log_[1\%N]$:

$h_N$ = 10^(-1.336 + $log_{10}(0.001/(0.033/RT)) + 1)$

To find the exact value of $h_N$, we need to know the value of $R$ (the gas constant) and calculate the value of $log_[1\%N]$. The value of $R$ is 8.314 J/(mol·K), and the value of $log_[1\%N]$ can be calculated as follows:

$log_[1\%N]$ = $log_{10}(0.001/(0.033/8.314\times1873))$
$log_[1\%N]$ = $log_{10}(0.001/(0.000387))$
$log_[1\%N]$ = $-2.992$

Substituting the values of $R$ and $log_[1\%N]$ into the equation for $h_N$:

$h_N$ = 10^(-1.336 + $-2.992 + 1)$
$h_N$ = 10^(-1.336 - 1.992)
$h_N$ = 10^(-3.328)
$h_N$ = 0.0492

Finally, we can find the equilibrium concentration of nitrogen by multiplying $h_N$ by 100 and rounding off to three decimal places:

[wt.%N] = $h_N$ × 100
[wt.%N] = 0.0",,,0,

If 200g of weight is lost over a period of 10 years, then the corrosion rate($kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$) is?(round off to the nearest integer)"," To calculate the corrosion rate, we can use the given equation:

Corrosion rate = (Weight loss / (Exposed surface area * Time))

Given:
Weight loss = 200g
Exposed surface area = 50 $cm^2$ = 0.05 $m^2$
Time = 10 years = 10 * 365 * 24 * 3600 $s$ = 31,536,000 $s$

Substituting the values:

Corrosion rate = (200g / (0.05 $m^2$ * 31,536,000 $s$))
Corrosion rate = 0.00000633 $kg.m^(2).s^(-1)$

Find value of y.(answer rounded off to the nearest integer)."," To find the value of y, we first need to find the concentration gradient and then use Fick's first law to calculate the flux.

Given: C(x) = a₁x² + a₂x

We are given that C(2) = $10^(-3}$ atoms.mm⁻³ and C(0) = 0. We can find the constants a₁ and a₂ by using the given values.

C(2) = a₁(2)² + a₂(2)
$10^(-3)$ = a₁(4) + 2a₂

Subtracting a₁(4) from both sides:
$10^(-3)$ = 2a₂
a₂ = $5*10^(-4)$

Now we can find a₁:
C(2) = a₁(2)² + a₂(2)
$10^(-3)$ = a₁(4) + $10^(-2)$
a₁ = $6.5*10^(-3)$

Now we can find the concentration gradient:
∂C/∂x = 2a₁x + a₂

At x = 2 mm:
∂C/∂x = 2($6.5*10^(-3)$)(2) + $5*10^(-4)$
∂C/∂x = $2.7*10^(-2)$

Now we can use Fick's first law to find the flux:
Jx = -D∂C/∂x
Jx = -($3*10^(-3)$)($2.7*10^(-2)$)
Jx = $-8.1*10^(-5)$

The given flux is y * $10^(-3)$ atoms.mm⁻²s⁻¹. We need to find y.

$-8.1*10^(-5)$ = y * $10^(-3)$
y = $-8.1$

Since the flux is a negative value, it means that the flux is in the negative x-direction. Therefore, the value of y is approximately -8.1 (rounded off to the nearest integer). However, since the flux is a negative value, it is not physically meaningful to have a positive value for y. Therefore, the answer is not valid.

For an FCC lattice, there is one atom per unit cell. So,

N = 1 * (1/a^3) = 1/a^3

The saturation magnetization is given as 600 kA/m, which is equal to 600 * 10^3 A/m^2. We can convert this to Bohr magnetons by using the relation:

1 A/m^2 = μ0 * 1 Bohr magneton

So,

600 * 10^3 A/m^2 = 600 * 10^3 * (4π * 1.25663706212 × 10^-7 T m/A) * 1 Bohr magneton
= 1.766 × 10^6 Bohr magnetons/m^3

Now, we can find the net magnetic moment per atom by dividing the saturation magnetization by the number of atoms per unit volume:

Magnetic moment per atom = Saturation magnetization / Number of atoms per unit volume
= 1.766 × 10^6 Bohr magnetons/m^3 / (1/a^3)
= 1.766 × 10^6 Bohr magnetons / m^3 * m^3/1
= 1.766 × 10^6 Bohr magnetons

To find the numerical value, we need to convert this to the given units:

1 Bohr magneton = 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T

So,

1.766 × 10^6 Bohr magnetons = 1.623 × 10^-20 J/T * 1.766 × 10^6
= 2.953 × 10^-13 J

Now, we can convert this to the given units:

1 J = 1 Coulomb * 1 m^2/s^2 / (1.602 × 10^-19 Coulomb)
= 6.242 × 10^18 m^2/s^2

So,

2.953 × 10^-13 J = 2.953 × 10^-13 J / (6.242 × 10^18 m^2/s^2)
= 4.75 × 10^-31 m^2/s^2

Therefore, the net magnetic moment per atom is approximately 4.75 × 10^-31 m^2/s^2 or 0.129 Bohr magnetons.

So, the answer is (D) 0.129.",,,0,

Given: 𝜇𝐵 = 9.273 × $10^(-24)$ A $m^2$, Lattice parameter of BCC iron is 0.287 nm Note: kA is kiloAmperes"," To calculate the saturation magnetization of Fe, we can use the equation:

Ms = N μB J

where N is the number of Fe atoms per unit volume, μB is the magnetic moment of a single Fe atom, and J is the number of magnetic moments aligned per unit volume when the material is fully magnetized.

First, we need to find the number of Fe atoms per unit volume. The volume of the unit cell is given by:

a³

where a is the lattice parameter. Since the BCC structure contains two atoms per unit cell, the number of Fe atoms per unit volume is:

N = (number of Fe atoms per unit cell) × (1/unit cell volume)

Explanation:

The figure schematically shows the atomic dipole moments in the absence of an external magnetic field. Ferromagnetism is characterized by the alignment of all magnetic moments in the same direction, while antiferromagnetism is characterized by the alignment of magnetic moments in opposite directions. Diamagnetism is the response of a material to an external magnetic field, where the induced magnetic moments are in the opposite direction to the applied field. Paramagnetism is the response of a material to an external magnetic field, where the induced magnetic moments are in the same direction as the applied field.

First, we need to convert the saturation magnetization to magnetic moment per unit volume:

M_s = 1700 $kAm^{-1}$ = 1700 $\times$ $10^3$ $Am^{-1}$ = 1700 $\times$ $10^3$ $JT^{-1}m^{-3}$

Next, we can find the magnetic moment per iron atom by dividing the saturation magnetization by the number of iron atoms per unit volume:

n_Fe = number of iron atoms per unit volume = number of iron atoms per unit cell $\times$ number of unit cells per unit volume

The lattice parameter of iron at room temperature is given as 0.287 nm, which corresponds to a cubic lattice with a cell volume of $a^3$ = $(0.287 nm)^3$ = $0.0812 nm^3$. Since iron has a body-centered cubic lattice, there are 2 iron atoms per unit cell. Therefore, the number of iron atoms per unit volume is:

n_Fe = 2 $\times$ $0.0812 nm^3$ = $0.1624 nm^{-3}$

Now we can find the magnetic moment per iron atom:

$\mu$ = M_s / n_Fe = 1700 $\times$ $10^3$ $JT^{-1}m^{-3}$ / $0.1624 nm^{-3}$ = $1.05 \times 10^{-22} JT^{-1}$ = $1.05 \times 10^{-23} Am^2$ (rounded off to 1 decimal place)",,,0,

Backscattered electrons (Q) are high-energy electrons that bounce back from the sample surface after colliding with atoms in the specimen. They carry information about the atomic number of the elements in the sample and are used for compositional analysis.

In this case, the sphere is not moving, so the drag force equals the buoyant force (FB), which is given by FB = ρvgV, where ρ is the density of the liquid, v is the velocity of the sphere (which is the terminal velocity we're trying to find), g is the acceleration due to gravity, and V is the volume of the sphere. Setting FD = FB, we have:

6πμvd = ρvgV

We're given the density of the steel ball ($ρ_(steel)$) and the density and viscosity of the liquid Al ($ρ_(Al)$ and $μ_(Al)$), so we can calculate the terminal velocity as follows:

First, we need to find the volume of the steel ball:

V = (4/3)πR³

Substituting the given density of the steel ball and solving for R:

R = (3M/4πρ_(steel))^(1/3)

Now we can calculate the volume of the steel ball:

V = (4/3)π[(3M/4πρ_(steel))^(1/3)]³

Substituting the given density of the steel ball and the density of the liquid Al, we have:

V = (4/3)π[(3(7200 kg/m³)/4π(2360 kg/m³)]³

Now we can substitute the volume and the given viscosity into the equation for the terminal velocity:

v = (2ρvd³)/9μ

Substituting the given density of the liquid Al and the volume of the steel ball, we have:

v = (2(2360 kg/m³)(3M/4π)³/(9(1*10^(–3) Pa.s)))

Simplifying this expression, we get:

v = 1.3*$10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s

Therefore, the answer is (C) 1.3*$10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s.

However, the given Reynolds number ($5*$10^(5)$) suggests that the flow around the steel ball is no longer in the Stokes regime, and the friction factor (f = 0.2) is not applicable.

At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is"," To calculate the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle, we can use the following equation:

m = ρAv

where:
- m is the mass flow rate
- ρ is the density of the liquid metal
- A is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle
- v is the velocity of the liquid metal at the nozzle exit

First, we need to find the velocity of the liquid metal at the nozzle exit. We can use the Bernoulli equation for steady, incompressible flow to relate the pressure and velocity at two points in the flow:

P1 + ρgH1 = P2 + ρgH2 + 1/2 ρv²

where:
- P1 is the pressure at the liquid surface in the vessel (assumed to be atmospheric pressure)
- H1 is the height of the liquid column in the vessel
- P2 is the pressure at the nozzle exit (which can be calculated using the nozzle discharge coefficient)
- H2 is the velocity head at the nozzle exit

Since P1 = atmospheric pressure and H1 = 3.2 m, we can calculate H2 as follows:

H2 = v²/2g

We can then solve for v using the given nozzle diameter and discharge coefficient:

A = πd²/4
v = m/(ρA)
Cd = m/(ρA√(2g(H1-H2)))

Solving for v:

v = (2g(H1-H2))/(Cd²)

Substituting the given values:

v = (2 x 9.81 m/s² x (3.2 m - H2))/(0.80)²

We need to find H2 to solve for v. We can use the Bernoulli equation to find H2:

P1 + ρgH1 = P2 + ρgH2 + 1/2 ρv²

Assuming P2 is atmospheric pressure:

P1 + ρgH1 = P2 + ρgH2 + 1/2 ρv²
101,325 Pa + 7000 kg/$m^3 x 9.81 m/s² x 3.2 m = 101,325 Pa + 7000 kg/$m^3 x 9.81 m/s² x H2 + 1/2 x 7000 kg/$m^3 x (v/√(2 x 9.81 m/s² x (3.2 m - H2)))²

Solving for H2:

H2 = 3.2 m - (v²/(2g))

Substituting v back into the equation:

H2 = 3.2 m - ( (2 x 9.81 m/s² x (3.2 m - H2))/(0.80)² )/(2 x 9.81 m/s²)

Solving this equation iteratively or numerically, we find that H2 ≈ 1.58 m.

Substituting the values back into the equation for velocity:

v ≈ 11.2 m/s

Now we can calculate the mass flow rate:

The volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed [in $(𝑚^(3).𝑠^(−1)).𝑚^(−2)$ , rounded off to the nearest integer] is"," To find the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed, we can use Darcy's law:

Q = -K A (dp/dz)

where:
- Q is the volumetric flow rate per unit area
- K is the permeability
- A is the cross-sectional area
- dp/dz is the pressure gradient

Given:
- g = 9.8 𝑚
- Density of water = 1000 𝑘𝑔 = 1000 kg/m³
- Pressure drop in the granular zone = 300 mm of water = 300 Pa
- Bed permeability = 0.8 $𝑚^(4).𝑁^(−1).𝑠^(−1)$ = 0.8 d³/N s m

First, we need to find the pressure gradient (dp/dz):

dp = ρgdh = 1000 kg/m³ × 9.8 𝑚 × 0.03 m = 30,000 Pa

Now, we can find the volumetric flow rate per unit area (Q):

Q = -K A (dp/dz) = -0.8 d³/N s m × A (30,000 Pa/m)

To find the cross-sectional area (A), we need to know the dimensions of the blast furnace. Let's assume a rectangular cross-section with a width of 1 m and a height of 10 m:

A = 1 m × 10 m = 10 m²

Now, we can find the volumetric flow rate per unit area (Q):

Q = -0.8 d³/N s m × 10 m² × 30,000 Pa/m = -24,000,000 Pa.m³/s

Since Darcy's law is applicable for laminar flow, we can convert the negative pressure to a positive flow rate:

Ignore the fluid friction due to viscosity and the drag due to changes in the direction of flow. If the volume of the mold cavity is 10 $m^3$, then the time(in seconds) required to fill the mold is?(roound off to nearest integer)"," The mold filling time in a top-gated mold can be calculated using the equation:

mgh = (1/2)mv²

where m is the mass of the liquid metal, g is the acceleration due to gravity, h is the height of the liquid column above the gate, and v is the velocity of the liquid metal at the gate.

First, we need to find the mass of the liquid metal required to fill the mold:

mass = volume × density

where the density of the liquid metal is assumed to be constant.

mass = 10 m³ × ρ

Next, we can find the velocity of the liquid metal at the gate using the equation:

mgh = (1/2)mv²

v² = 2gh

v = √(2gh)

Now, we can find the time required to fill the mold by dividing the volume of the mold cavity by the cross-sectional area of the gate and the velocity of the liquid metal at the gate:

time = 10 m³ / (0.2 m² × √(19.6 m.s⁻²))

time = 10 m³ / (0.2 m² × 4.43 m.s⁻¹)

The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is:  (A) ΔPR/(2L) (B) ΔPR/L (C) 3ΔPR/(2L) (D) 2ΔPR/L"," The correct answer is (B) ΔPR/L.

Explanation:

The given equation for the axial velocity $v_z$ is:

$v_z$ = [ΔP/L]*({$R^2$ - $r^2$}/4µ)

This equation shows that the axial velocity depends on the pressure difference (ΔP), the length of the tube (L), the viscosity (µ), and the radial distance from the axis (r).

The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is given by Newton's law of viscosity:

$\tau$ = µ*($\partial v_z$/$\partial r$)

Since the flow is fully developed, the velocity profile is independent of the axial position (z), so the partial derivative of the axial velocity with respect to the radial position is constant. Therefore, we can evaluate the shear stress at the wall (r = R) and substitute the expression for $v_z$:

$\tau$ = µ*($\partial$ [ΔP/L]*({$R^2$ - $r^2$}/4µ)/$\partial r$)|$_{r=R}$

$\tau$ = µ*[ΔP/L]*($-$2*R/4µ)

$\tau$ = -ΔP/2L

Explanation:

The given context describes a non-rotating smooth solid spherical object fixed in the stream of an inviscid incompressible fluid. The flow is horizontal, slow, steady, and fully developed far from the object.

From the context, we know that the flow is deflected around the sphere, as indicated by the streamline arrows near point O. This deflection of the flow around the sphere is called the wake, and it is a common feature of flow around bluff bodies like a sphere.

Therefore, statement (D) is true. The flow is deflected round the object on each side of the central streamline OA.

The other statements are not necessarily true:

(A) The velocity of the fluid at the point A is not necessarily zero. The velocity of the fluid at the point A depends on the shape of the sphere and the flow conditions.

(B) The fluid pressure at the point A may not exceed that at point O. The pressure distribution around a sphere in an inviscid flow is given by the Bernoulli equation, which predicts that the highest pressure occurs at the stagnation points where the fluid velocity is zero. Since the velocity at point A is not necessarily zero, the pressure at point A may or may not exceed that at point O.

(C) Fluid moving precisely along OA will not turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object. The flow is fully developed far from the object, which means that the velocity profile is parallel to the streamlines. Therefore, fluid moving precisely along OA will continue to move in the same direction and will not turn perpendicular to OA.",,,0,

Ladle deoxidation of liquid steel is done at 1600°C by adding ferro-aluminium. By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?"," To calculate the time required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m in liquid steel, we can use Stokes' law. First, we need to find the density difference between the alumina particles and the steel, and the gravitational force acting on the particle.

1. Density difference: ρalumina = 3650 kg/$m^3$, ρsteel = 7000 kg/$m^3$
ρd = ρsteel - ρalumina = 3350 kg/$m^3$

2. Particle dimensions: d = 50 µm = 50 × 10^-6 m

3. Gravitational force: Fg = ρdVg = ρd × πd³/6
Fg = 3350 × π × (50 × 10^-6)³/6 = 1.12 × 10^-6 N

4. Viscosity of steel: μ = 6 × 10^-3 kg/m/s

5. Using Stokes' law, the upward drag force on the particle is given by: Fd = 6πμdU

Since the particle is rising, the net force acting on it is the difference between the gravitational force and the upward drag force. We want to find the time it takes for the particle to reach the surface, so we set the net force equal to zero and solve for the velocity:

Fg - Fd = 0
1.12 × 10^-6 - 6π × 6 × 10^-3 × 50 × 10^-6 × U = 0

Solving for U:

U = 1.12 × 10^-6 / (6π × 6 × 10^-3 × 50 × 10^-6) = 1.22 × 10^-3 m/s

Now that we have the velocity, we can use it to find the time it takes for the particle to rise from a depth of 2m:

t = d/(2U) = 2/(2 × 1.22 × 10^-3) = 1.64 × 10^-3 s or 1.64 ms.

Explanation: Decreasing the objective aperture size in an optical microscope increases the spherical aberration because it reduces the angle of the most oblique rays collected by the lens, which in turn decreases the numerical aperture and worsens the spherical aberration. This results in a lower resolution and a less sharp image.",,,0,

The smallest minimum feature size that can be theoretically resolved in an optical microscope depends on the wavelength of radiation and the numerical aperture of the objective lens. The refractive index of the medium between the lens and the focal point affects the numerical aperture and thus the resolution, but it does not determine the resolution directly. The intensity of radiation does not affect the resolution.",,,0,

Miscellaneous,6,G-META-17-39,NUM,36,"A solution contains $10^(-3)$ M of $Fe^(+3)$ at 25°C. The solubility product of $Fe(OH)_3$ is $10^(-39)$. Assuming activity equals concentration, the minimum pH at which $Fe^(+3)$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is?(answer up to two decimals places)"," To find the minimum pH at which $Fe^{3+}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$, we need to find the pH at which the product of the $Fe^{3+}$ concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration ($OH^{-}$) is equal to the solubility product constant ($K_{sp}$).

Given:
$[Fe^{3+}] = 10^{-3} M$
$K_{sp} = 10^{-39}$

We know that the solubility product expression for $Fe(OH)_3$ is:

$K_{sp} = [Fe^{3+}][OH^{-}]^3$

Assuming activity equals concentration, we have:

$[OH^{-}] = 10^{-14} M$ (pH = 14 is the pH at which $OH^{-}$ concentration is $10^{-14} M$)

Substituting the given value of $[Fe^{3+}]$ and the calculated value of $[OH^{-}]$ into the solubility product expression, we get:

$10^{-39} = (10^{-3})(10^{-14})^3$

Solving for the exponent of $10^{-14}$, we get:

$3 \times log_{10}(10^{-14}) + log_{10}(10^{-3}) = log_{10}(10^{-39})$

Using the property of logarithms, we have:

$3 \times (-14) + log_{10}(10^{-3}) = -39$

Solving for $log_{10}(10^{-3})$, we get:

$log_{10}(10^{-3}) = -36$

Taking the exponent of $10$ to get the concentration of $Fe^{3+}$, we have:

$[Fe^{3+}] = 10^{-3}$

So, the minimum pH at which $Fe^{3+}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is:

$pH = 14 + log_{10}([OH^{-}]) = 14 + log_{10}(10^{-3} / [Fe^{3+}]) = 14 + log_{10}(10^{-3} / 10^{-3}) = 14 + log_{10}(1) = 14$

However, this answer is not physically meaningful since the pH cannot be greater than 14 in a solution containing only water and $Fe^{3+}$. Therefore, the given assumption that activity equals concentration is not valid in this case, and we need to use the actual activity coefficients to find the minimum pH for precipitation.

So, the answer is not provided in this case.",,,0,
Miscellaneous,7,G-META-20-44,NUM,41,"Given, density of oxide is 6.5 $g.cm^(-3)$. A metal oxidizes at 1200K with a parabolic rate constant of 3* $10^(-6)g^(2).cm^(-4).s^(-1)$. Time taken(in seconds) for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is?(round off to two decimal places). "," To find the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm, we can use the parabolic rate equation:

x^2 = kt

where x is the thickness of the oxide film, k is the parabolic rate constant, and t is the time.

We are given the density of the oxide as 6.5 g.cm^(-3), and we want to find the thickness of the oxide film, which is 2 µm or 2*10^-6 cm. We can first find the mass of the oxide film using its density and volume:

mass = density * volume = 6.5 g.cm^(-3) * (2*10^-6 cm)^3 = 6.5*10^-12 g

We can then use the molar mass of SiO2 (60 g.mol^-1) to find the number of moles of SiO2 in the film:

moles = mass / molar mass = 6.5*10^-12 g / 60 g.mol^-1 = 1.08*10^-13 mol

We can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of oxygen gas that reacted to form the SiO2 film:

moles_O2 = moles / (molar mass_SiO2 / molar mass_O2) = 1.08*10^-13 mol / (60 g.mol^-1 / 32 g.mol^-1) = 1.77*10^-14 mol

We can then use the given parabolic rate constant to find the time taken for the oxide film to grow to its final thickness:

t = x^2 / (k * density) = (2*10^-6 cm)^2 / (3*10^-6 g^2.cm^(-4).s^(-1) * 6.5 g.cm^(-3)) = 1.18*10^6 s = 1.18*10^3 s (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is approximately 1.18*10^3 seconds or 1.18 hours.",,,0,
