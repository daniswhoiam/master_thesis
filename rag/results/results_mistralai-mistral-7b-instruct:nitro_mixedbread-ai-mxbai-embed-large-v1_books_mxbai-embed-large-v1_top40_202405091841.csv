Thermodynamics,2,G-XEC-2012-6,MCQS,49,"Of the following materials, which is the most suitable for an LED emitting at around 380 nm?  (A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap (B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap (C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap (D) Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap "," A. Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap.

Explanation:

The question asks for a material suitable for an LED emitting at around 380 nm. The suitability of a material for an LED depends on its bandgap energy and whether it is a direct or indirect bandgap material.

A direct bandgap material is suitable for an LED because it allows for the emission of photons with little or no change in momentum, which is necessary for efficient radiative recombination of electrons and holes. A small bandgap energy is desirable for an LED emitting in the blue or ultraviolet region because it requires less energy to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band.

Therefore, option A, a direct bandgap material with a small bandgap, is the most suitable choice for an LED emitting at around 380 nm.

Option B, an indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap, is not suitable for an LED because it requires the involvement of phonons in the recombination process, which reduces the transition probability and inhibits stimulated emission.

Option C, a direct bandgap material with a large bandgap, is not suitable for an LED emitting at around 380 nm because it requires a larger energy input to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, making it less efficient for blue or ultraviolet LEDs.

Option D, an indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap, is not a suitable choice for an LED because it is not a common material for LEDs due to its indirect bandgap. Indirect bandgap materials require the involvement of phonons in the recombination process, which reduces the transition probability and inhibits stimulated emission. Additionally, a small bandgap in an indirect material would not provide the necessary energy for efficient blue or ultraviolet LED emission.",,,0,

Thermodynamics,4,G-XEC-2013-15,NUM,29,"The band gap of a semiconducting material used to make an LED is 1.43 eV. What will be the minimum wavelength ofthe radiation emitted by this LED, in μm?","The minimum wavelength of radiation emitted by an LED can be calculated using the equation l = hc/eV, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, e is the charge of an electron, and V is the acceleration voltage (which is equal to the band gap energy in this case).

l = 871.8 nm

Explanation: At low injection level, the minority carrier concentration in a forward biased p-n junction is equal to the majority carrier concentration due to the recombination of minority carriers with majority carriers in the neutral regions of the semiconductor.

If 100 g of water that is at 90 °C is added to the cup, the final temperature of water in °C is","To find the final temperature of water in the cup after adding 100 g of water at 90 °C, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. First, let's calculate the initial internal energy of the system:

U_i = m_w1 * Cp_w * T_w1 + m_c * Cp_c * T_c

where m_w1 = 80 g, Cp_w = 4.18 J/g °C, T_w1 = 4 °C, m_c = 140 g, and Cp_c = 0.385 J/g °C.

U_i = 80 * 4.18 * 4 + 140 * 0.385 * 277
U_i = 1150.72 J

Next, let's calculate the initial enthalpy of the water in the cup:

H_i = m_w1 * (h_fus_w(T_w1) + Cp_w * T_w1)

where h_fus_w(T_w1) is the enthalus_fus(T_w1) = 4.18 * 4 = 17.12 J/g.

H_i = 80 * (17.12 + 4.18 * 4)
H_i = 80 * 21.28 = 170.24 J

Now, let's calculate the initial enthalpy of the added water:

H_w2 = m_w2 * h_fg_w(T_w2)

where m_w2 = 100 g and h_fg_w(T_w2) is the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 90 °C, which can be found from steam tables or online resources.

h_fg_w(90 °C) = 2418.3 kJ/kg = 2418.3 * 10^3 J/kg = 2418300 J/kg
H_w2 = 100 * 2418300 = 241830000 J

The final internal energy of the system can be calculated as:

U_f = U_i + H_w2 - W

where W is the work done during the process, which is assumed to be zero in this case since no work is done.

U_f = 1150.72 + 241830000 - 0
U_f = 241831150.72 J

To find the final temperature of water in the cup, we can use the specific heat of water and the principle of conservation of energy:

m_w1 * Cp_w * (T_w_f - T_w1) + m_c * Cp_c * (T_c_f - T_c) = U_f - H_i

where T_w_f is the final temperature of water in the cup and T_c_f is the final temperature of the copper cup.

First, let's find T_c_f:

m_c * Cp_c * (T_c_f - T_c) = U_f - H_i
140 * 0.385 * (T_c_f - 277) = 241831150.72 - 170.24
T_c_f = 277 + (241831150.72 - 170.24) / (140 * 0.385)
T_c_f = 277 + 1699999.98
T_c_f = 1699999.98 + 277
T_c_f = 1700276.98 °C

Since this temperature is not reasonable, it seems there is an error in the given data or the problem statement. The final temperature of water in the cup should be lower than the initial temperature of the copper cup, and the final temperature of the copper cup should be higher than the initial temperature of the copper cup.

ΔE = Rydberg constant × (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)

ΔE = (1.097 × 10^7 m^-1) × (1/16 - 1/9) = 2.179 × 10^-18 J

To convert this energy to eV, we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J:

ΔE = 2.179 × 10^-18 J / (1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.353 × 10^-16 eV

The Rydberg equation can also be used to find the wavelength of the emitted photon:

Substituting n1 = 4 and n2 = 2, we get:

λ = (1.097 × 10^7 m^-1) × (1/16 - 1/9) = 6.563 × 10^-7 m

To convert this wavelength to μm, we use the conversion factor 1 μm = 1 × 10^-6 m:

λ = 6.563 × 10^-7 m / (1 × 10^-6 m/μm) = 656.3 nm

Therefore, the energy in eV and the wavelength in μm, respectively, of the photon emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom falls from n = 4 to n = 2 state is 1.353 × 10^-16 eV and 656.3 nm.

Explanation: The glass transition temperature (Tg) is a non-equilibrium transition where the material changes from a supercooled liquid to a solid with a disordered structure. The heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient both undergo significant changes during this transition. The heat capacity increases due to the onset of configurational degrees of freedom, while the thermal expansion coefficient decreases due to the decrease in the number of degrees of freedom as the material becomes more rigid.

The band gap of silicon is 1.1 eV.,"To calculate the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV, we first need to determine the number of photons that can be produced from the given x-ray energy and the number of electron-hole pairs generated per photon.

First, we need to find the number of photons in one joule of energy:

1 J = 6.24 × 10^18 photons/J

Next, we need to find the number of photons in one keV of energy:

1 keV = 1.602 × 10^-13 J

So, the number of photons in 1.54 keV = 1.54 × 10^-13 J × 6.24 × 10^18 photons/J = 9.63 × 10^14 photons

Now, we need to find the number of electron-hole pairs generated per photon. Since the energy gap of silicon is 1.1 eV, the energy required to generate one electron-hole pair is 2 × 1.1 eV = 2.2 eV.

So, the number of electron-hole pairs generated per photon = energy of one photon / energy required to generate one electron-hole pair = 1.54 eV / 2.2 eV = 0.70 eV^-1

Finally, we can calculate the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated:

Maximum number of electron-hole pairs = number of photons × number of electron-hole pairs generated per photon = 9.63 × 10^14 photons × 0.70 eV^-1 = 6.74 × ×10^14 electron-hole pairs

D'(T') = 2 × D(1300 K)

First, we need to find D(1300 K):

D(1300 K) = D₀ × e^(-Q/R × 1300 K)

Now, we set up the equation for D'(T'):

D'(T') = 2 × D(1300 K)

D'(T') = 2 × D₀ × e^(-Q/R × T')

Since D₀ is a constant, we can cancel it out:

e^(-Q/R × T') = 2 × e^(-Q/R × 1300 K)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(e^(-Q/R × T')) = ln(2) + ln(e^(-Q/R × 1300 K))

ln(-Q/R × T') = ln(2) - ln(e^(-Q/R × 1300 K))

Using the property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we get:

ln(-Q/R × T'/e^(-Q/R × 1300 K)) = ln(2)

Now, we can solve for T':

T' = -R × e^(Q/R × 1300 K) × 2^(ln(2))

T' = -8.314 J/mol^(-1) × e^(148 kJ/mol × 1300 K/8.314 J/mol^(-1) K) × 2^(0.6931)

Thermodynamics,26,G-XEC-2020-8,NUM,80,"A ceramic material is periodically heated and cooled between 25° C and a higher temperature $T_f$.

Material's coefficient of thermal expansion is 7.5* $10^(-6)°C^(-1)$ and modulus of elasticity (E) is 200GPa. The lowest value of $T_f$( in °C) at which material will fail is?(round off to the nearest integer.). Assume that there is no plastic deformation during thermal cycling. "," To find the lowest value of $T\_f$ at which the material will fail, we need to determine the maximum thermal stress developed in the material during thermal cycling and compare it with the maximum compressive stress the material can withstand.

The thermal stress developed in the material can be calculated using the equation:

$$\sigma\_T = E \alpha \Delta T$$

where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion and $\Delta T$ is the temperature change.

Since the material is periodically heated and cooled between 25°C and $T\_f$, the temperature change can be calculated as:

$$\Delta T = T\_f - 25^\circ C$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\sigma\_T = 200GPa \times 7.5 \times 10^{-6} \times (\Delta T)$$

To find the value of $\Delta T$ that makes $\sigma\_T = 200MPa$, we set the right-hand side of the equation equal to $200MPa$ and solve for $\Delta T$:

$$200MPa = 200GPa \times 7.5 \times 10^{-6} \times \Delta T$$

$$\Delta T = \frac{200MPa}{200GPa \times 7.5 \times 10^{-6}}$$

$$\Delta T \approx 117.65^\circ C$$

Therefore, the lowest value of $T\_f$ at which the material will fail is:

$$T\_f \approx 25^\circ C + 117.65^\circ C = 142.65^\circ C$$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is $T\_f \approx 143^\circ C$.",,,0,

/Δ1G = −4πr³/Δ1Gv + 4πr²γsl

We are given ΔGv and γsl, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

/Δ1G = −4πr³(0.18*10^(9) J.m^(-3)) + 4πr²(0.18 J.m^(-2))

To simplify the equation, we can first find the constant term:

Constant term = −4π(0.18*10^(9) J.m^(-3))

Now, we can set the Gibbs free energy change equal to zero to find the critical radius:

0 = −4πr³(0.18*10^(9) J.m^(-3)) + 4πr²(0.18 J.m^(-2))

To solve for r, we can first divide both sides by 4π:

0 = −r³(0.18*10^(9) J.m^(-3)) + r²(0.18 J.m^(-2))

Next, we can bring the terms with r to one side and set it equal to zero:

r³(0.18*10^(9) J.m^(-3)) − r²(0.18 J.m^(-2)) = 0

We can factor out r² from the left side:

r²(0.18*10^(9) J.m^(-3) − 0.18 J.m^(-2)) = 0

Since r cannot be zero (as it represents the radius of the critical nucleus), the term in parentheses must be zero:

0.18*10^(9) J.m^(-3) − 0.18 J.m^(-2) = 0

We can solve for r by setting the terms equal to each other and converting to the same units:

0.18 J.m^(-2) = 0.18*10^(9) J.m^(-3) * 1 m^3

r = (0.18 J.m^(-2))^(1/3) * 1 m

r ≈ 0.028 m ≈ 28 nm

(A) Low deposition rate and low substrate temperature (B) Low deposition rate and high substrate temperature (C) High deposition rate and low substrate temperature (D) High deposition rate and high substrate temperature,"The correct answer is (B) Low deposition rate and high substrate temperature. The reason is that at high substrate temperatures, the surface mobility of adsorbed atoms and clusters is increased, allowing them to move larger distances before being incorporated into growing nuclei, resulting in a relatively low concentration of nuclei and thus larger crystallites. The substrate temperature is the most significant factor contributing to high mobility, and therefore grain size tends to increase with increasing substrate temperature. However, at low deposition rates, there is more time for the adsorbed atoms to move and form larger grains. Therefore, the combination of low deposition rate and high substrate temperature favours the formation of larger grains in thin films.",,,0,

Thermodynamics,41,G-XEC-2022-15,MCQS,110,"A student aims to deposit a thin metallic film on $SiO_2$ substrate, with an adhesion layer between the metal film and substrate, in a contiguous planar fashion. Island type of growth must be avoided. The student performs an extensive optimization exercise. Which one of the following steps is in the right direction?   (A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing","The correct answer is (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited.

Explanation:

The goal is to deposit a thin metallic film on a $SiO_2$ substrate with an adhesion layer between them to ensure good adhesion and avoid island type of growth. The interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the substrate ($σs$) and between the adhesion layer and the metal film ($σf$) are important factors in determining the growth mode.

The condition for layer-by-layer growth mode is $\Delta σ=σf+σi-σs=0$, where $σi$ is the interfacial energy between the metal film and the substrate. However, this condition is rigorously fulfilled only for homoepitaxy, where $σs=σf$ and $σi=0$. For heteroepitaxy, the growth mode depends on the lattice mismatch between the substrate and the film and the interfacial energy.

Therefore, choosing a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$ is the right direction as it can improve the adhesion between the adhesion layer and the substrate, making it less likely for the film to detach during deposition and ensuring good coverage and uniformity.

The other options are not necessarily incorrect but may not directly contribute to the goal of avoiding island type of growth and ensuring good adhesion. For example, increasing the substrate temperature and decreasing the deposition rate may improve the film quality but do not directly address the interfacial energy issue. Using intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing may help improve the film properties but may not necessarily prevent island type of growth.",,,0,

The resistivity of a pure semiconductor at 298 K is 3000 Ωm. Assume that the number of electrons excited ($𝑛_e$) across the band gap is given by the relation $n_e$ = $(N_A)*exp(-{E_g/k_(B)T})$. The band gap(in ev) ($𝐸_g$) of the semiconductor is? (Round off to two decimals) "," To find the band gap of the semiconductor, we can use the given information about the resistivity and the mobilities of electrons and holes. The resistivity is related to the carrier densities and their mobilities through the equation:

ρ = 1/(ne * μe) + 1/(np * μp)

where ne and np are the electron and hole densities, respectively. At thermal equilibrium, the product of the carrier densities is given by the mass-action law:

ne * np = n0^2

where n0 is the intrinsic carrier density. We can rearrange this equation to find the relationship between the electron and hole densities:

np = n0^2 / ne

Now, we can use the given mobility values and the resistivity to find the carrier densities. We know that the resistivity is given by:

ρ = 1/(ne * μe) + 1/(np * μp)
3000 Ωm = 1/(ne * 0.14 m^2/(V s)) + 1/(np * 0.06 m^2/(V s))

We can solve for ne and np using this equation:

ne = ρ * (1/0.14 m^2/(V s) + 1/0.06 m^2/(V s) * np)
np = n0^2 / ne

We can simplify this equation by expressing np in terms of ne:

np = n0^2 / (ρ * (1/0.14 m^2/(V s) + 1/0.06 m^2/(V s) * np))

To find the intrinsic carrier density n0, we can use the given relation for the number of electrons excited across the band gap:

n0 = N_A * exp(-E_g / k_B * T)

We can rearrange this equation to find E_g in terms of n0:

E_g = -k_B * T * ln(N_A / n0)

Now, we can use an iterative method to find the value of E_g that satisfies the equation for np. We can guess a value for E_g, calculate np using the equation above, and then check if np satisfies the mass-action law with the calculated value of ne. If not, we adjust the value of E_g and repeat the process until we find a value that satisfies the mass-action law.

Using the given temperature of 298 K, we can start by guessing a value for E_g, such as 1 eV. We can calculate ne using the given relation:

ne = N_A * exp(-E_g / k_B * T) = 6.02 * 10^(23) * exp(-1 / 8.62 * 10^(-5) * 298) = 1.11 * 10^(20) m^-3

We can then calculate np using the equation above:

np = n0^2 / ne = (1.11 * 10^(20))^2 / (1.11 * 10^(20)) = 1.23 * 10^(20) m^-3

We can check if the mass-action law is satisfied:

ne * np = (1.11 * 10^(20)) * (1.23 * 10^(20)) = 1.37 * 10^(21) m^-3

This value is not equal to the intrinsic carrier density n0, so we need to adjust the value of E_g and repeat the process. By iterating this process, we can find that the value of E_g that satisfies the mass-action law and the given resistivity is approximately 1.13 eV.

Therefore, the band gap of the semiconductor is approximately 1.13 eV.",,,0,
Thermodynamics,43,G-XEC-2022-21,NUM,81,"A new glass material is developed to minimize the transmission of the light through the window with glass panel of thickness 5 mm. The refractive index of the glass material is 1.5 and the absorption coefficient can be changed from 0.3 $cm^(-1)$ to 1 $cm^(-1)$. In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places) ","To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel, we need to use the reflection and transmission coefficients for the given refractive index and absorption coefficient.

First, let's calculate the reflection coefficient (R) and transmission coefficient (T) for the given refractive index (n) and absorption coefficient (α) using Eqs. (16.5) and (16.6) respectively.

R = (n - 1)2 + α2(n + 1)2 + α2
T = (1 - R)2exp(-αl)

where l is the thickness of the glass panel (5 mm = 5 × 10-3 m).

Now, we need to find the maximum and minimum transmission coefficients for the given range of absorption coefficients (0.3 cm-1 to 1 cm-1). To do this, we can plot the transmission coefficient as a function of absorption coefficient and find the maximum and minimum values.

However, we can also approximate the maximum and minimum transmission coefficients using the following relationships:

When α = 0, T = 1 (no absorption)
When α is large, T approaches 0 (complete absorption)

So, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel can be approximated as:

Ratio = T(min) / T(max) = T(max) / T(min) = 1 / T(min)

To find T(min), we can use the given absorption coefficient of 0.3 cm-1 and the refractive index of 1.5:

T(min) = (1 - R(min))2exp(-αl)

where R(min) can be calculated using the given refractive index and absorption coefficient:

R(min) = (n - 1)2 + α2(n + 1)2 + α2

Substituting the given values, we get:

R(min) = (1.5 - 1)2 + (0.3)2(1.5 + 1)2 + (0.3)2 = 0.363

T(min) = (1 - 0.363)2exp(-0.3 × 5 × 10-3) = 0.485

So, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is:

Ratio = 1 / T(min) = 1 / 0.485 = 2.05

Therefore, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is approximately 2.05.",,,0,

If the reaction rate is to be tripled, the temperature of the reaction should be  (A) 174.5 K (B) 447.5 K (C) 600.5 K (D) 847.5 K"," To find the temperature at which the reaction rate is tripled, we can use the Arrhenius equation:

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

where k is the reaction rate, A is the frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

We want to find T when k' = 3k, so we can set up the equation:

3k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

To solve for T, we need to take the natural logarithm of both sides and rearrange:

ln(3) + ln(A) = ln(e^(-Ea/RT))

Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify:

ln(3) + ln(A) = -Ea/RT

Now we need to find the value of R, which is 8.314 J/mol K. We can rewrite the equation as:

T = -Ea/(R ln(3) + ln(A))

Substituting the values, we get:

T = -8314 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol K ln(3) + ln(A))

To find the value of ln(A), we can use the fact that the reaction rate at 300 K is given, so we can write:

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

Substituting the values, we get:

k = Ae^(-8314 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol K x 300 K))

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:

ln(A) = ln(k) + Ea/RT

Substituting the values, we get:

ln(A) = ln(k) + 8314 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol K x 300 K)

Now we can substitute this value of ln(A) back into the equation for T:

T = -8314 J/mol / [8.314 J/mol K (ln(k) + 8314 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol K x 300 K))]

To simplify the expression, we can first calculate the term in the square brackets:

ln(k) + 8314 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol K x 300 K) = ln(k) + 0.00112

Substituting this back into the equation for T, we get:

T = -8314 J/mol / [8.314 J/mol K (ln(k) + 0.00112)]

To find the temperature at which the reaction rate is tripled, we need to find the value of k' = 3k. Since we don't know the value of k, we can't directly calculate the temperature. However, we can make an approximation based on the given information.

The activation energy is given as 8.314 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to 8.314 x 10^3 J/mol. We can assume that the frequency factor A is roughly the same order of magnitude as the reaction rate at 300 K. Let's assume A = 1 x 10^12 mol/m^3/s.

Using the Arrhenius equation, we can calculate the reaction rate at 300 K:

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT) = 1 x 10^12 mol/m^3/s x e^(-8.314 x 10^3 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol K x 300 K)) = 1.2 x 10^5 mol/m^3/s

To find the temperature at which the reaction rate is tripled, we can set up the equation:

3k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

Substituting the values we have calculated, we get:

3 x 1.2 x 10^5 mol/m^3/s = 1 x 10^1",,,0,

Given that ∆G° = -RTlnK, we can rearrange this equation to find K:

K = exp(-∆G°/RT)

Substituting the given values:

K = exp(-8120 J/(8.314 J/mol·K·mol) × (1173 K + 273.15 K))

Now, we can find the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$:

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{CO}/(p_{CO_2} \times K)$

$p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{total} \times x_{CO_2}$

$p_{FeO}$ = $p_{total} \times x_{FeO}$

Since the reaction is at equilibrium, $x_{CO_2}$ + $x_{CO}$ + $x_{FeO}$ = 1

We can use this relationship to find $x_{CO_2}$:

$x_{CO_2}$ = 1 - $x_{CO}$ - $x_{Fe}$

Substituting the given value of $x_{Fe}$ = 1, we get:

$x_{CO_2}$ = 1 - $x_{CO}$ - 1

$x_{CO_2}$ = $x_{CO}$

Now, we can find $p_{CO_2}$:

$p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{total} \times x_{CO}$

Substituting the given value of $p_{total}$ = 1 bar:

$p_{CO_2}$ = 1 bar × $x_{CO}$

Now, we can find the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$:

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{CO}/(p_{CO_2} \times K)$

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{CO}/(1 \times K)$

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{CO}/K$

Substituting the given value of $p_{CO}$ = 1 atm = 1.01325 bar:

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = 1.01325 bar / K

To find K, we need to use the given value of ∆G°:

K = exp(-8120 J/(8.314 J/mol·K·mol) × (1173 K + 273.15 K))

K = 0.000125

Substituting this value back into the equation for $p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$:

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = 1.01325 bar / 0.000125

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = 8314.67

To find the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$:

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{CO}/(p_{CO_2} \times K)$

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{CO}/(8314.67 \times 0.000125)$

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{CO}/1.01325$

$p_{CO}/p_{CO_2}$ = 0.9898

Therefore, the ratio of $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$ is closest to option (B) 0.25, but it is not exactly equal to that value. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options. However, based on the given information, the best answer would be (B) 0.25.",,,0,

The given equation for the integral enthalpy of mixing is mix $ΔH^(mix)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$. Here, $χ_(Cu)$ and $χ_(Zn)$ are the mole fractions of copper and zinc, respectively.

To find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we need to differentiate the given equation with respect to $χ_(Cu)$ while keeping $χ_(Zn)$ constant.

Using the given equation, we have:

∂(mix $ΔH^(mix)$)∂$χ_(Cu)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$

Now, we need to find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, which is given by:

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = ∂(mix $ΔH^(mix)$)∂$χ_(Cu)$

Using the chain rule, we have:

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = ∂(mix $ΔH^(mix)$)∂$χ_(Cu)$ * ∂$χ_(Cu)$/∂$χ_(Cu)$

Since ∂$χ_(Cu)$/∂$χ_(Cu)$ = 1, we have:

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$

Now, we need to find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu in terms of the mole fractions of copper and zinc. Using the given equation for the integral enthalpy of mixing, we have:

mix $ΔH^(mix)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

Differentiating both sides with respect to $χ_(Cu)$, we get:

∂(mix $ΔH^(mix)$)∂$χ_(Cu)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$

Comparing this with the expression for the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we have:

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$

Assume that air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen.,"To find the theoretical requirement of air for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$, we first need to determine the theoretical air requirement based on the stoichiometric equation for $CH_4$ combustion.

The stoichiometric equation for $CH_4$ combustion is:

$CH_4 + 2(O_2 + 3.76N_2) \rightarrow 9CO_2 + 2H_2O + 86.89N_2$

From this equation, we can see that for every mole of $CH_4$, we need 2 moles of $O_2$ and 3.76 moles of $N_2$. Since 1 mole of $O_2$ occupies approximately 22.4 $L$ at STP, and 1 mole of $N_2$ occupies approximately 20.2 $L$ at STP, the total theoretical air requirement (in $m^3$ at STP) for the complete combustion of 1 mole of $CH_4$ is:

$2(22.4) + 3.76(20.2) = 23.11 \approx 23.11 m^3$

Now, since we have 100 $m^3$ of $CH_4$ at STP, the theoretical air requirement for its complete combustion would be:

$100 m^3 \times 23.11 m^3/mol \approx 2311 m^3$

(D) Increasing temperature and decreasing pressure."," The correct answer is (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure.

Explanation:
The Boudouard reaction, C (s) + CO2 (g) ⇋ 2CO (g), is an important reaction in iron making. The standard Gibbs free energy change of this reaction at 298 K is given as ΔG° = 172000 J/mol.

To determine the conditions that favor the forward reaction, we need to consider the sign of ΔG. When ΔG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous and favors the forward direction. When ΔG is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous and favors the reverse direction.

The Gibbs free energy change of a reaction is given by the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, where ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change.

Since ΔH for the Boudouard reaction is negative, increasing the temperature and pressure will favor the forward reaction by increasing the value of T and P, respectively, and making ΔG more negative.

Therefore, the answer is (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure.",,,0,

The following reactions are assumed to be at thermodynamic equilibrium: ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g) and  2CO(g) = $CO_2$(g) + C(s). Assume ideal gas behaviour. Based on mole balance, the relationship applicable to the system at equilibrium is  (A)	$p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$ (B) $p_(Zn)$ = 2*$p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (C) $p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (D) $p_(Zn)$ = 0.5*$p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$"," The correct answer is (B) $p_(Zn)$ = 2*$p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$.

Explanation:

At equilibrium, the number of moles of each species remains constant. The given reactions are:

ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g)
2CO(g) = CO2(g) + C(s)

From the first reaction, we can see that for every mole of ZnO(s) that reacts, one mole of Zn(g) and one mole of CO(g) are produced. Therefore, the number of moles of Zn(g) and CO(g) in the system is equal to the number of moles of ZnO(s) that reacted.

Since the system is closed, the total number of moles of gas remains constant. The number of moles of N2 in the air entering the reactor is not relevant to the equilibrium composition of the products, so we can ignore it.

Let the number of moles of ZnO(s) that reacted be x. Then, the number of moles of Zn(g) and CO(g) produced are also x each. The number of moles of CO2(g) produced is 2x.

At equilibrium, the partial pressures of each gas are related to their mole fractions and the total pressure by the ideal gas law:

$p_i$ = $n_i$ * $R$ * $T$ / $V$

where $p_i$ is the partial pressure of species i, $n_i$ is the number of moles of species i, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $V$ is the volume.

Since the total number of moles of gas is constant, the total pressure is also constant. Let the total pressure be P. Then, the partial pressures of Zn(g) and CO(g) are each $x$ * ($R$ * $T$ / $V$) = $x$ * ($P$ / $V$) = $px$ / $V$. The partial pressure of CO2(g) is 2x * ($R$ * $T$ / $V$) = 2x * ($P$ / $V$) = 2*$px$ / $V$.

Therefore, the relationship applicable to the system at equilibrium is:

$p_{Zn}$ + $p_{CO}$ = $p_{Zn}$ + $p_{CO}$ + $p_{CO_2}$

Simplifying, we get:

$p_{Zn}$ = 2*$p_{CO}$ + $p_{CO_2}$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $p_(Zn)$ = 2*$p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$.",,,0,

For a SiC grain size of 20 µm, the average interparticle (SiC-SiC) neck size (in µm) is:  (A) 3.03 (B) 4.28 (C) 9.16 (D) 18.32 ","To calculate the average interparticle neck size, we can use the Young-Laplace equation for capillary forces:

$γ\left( \theta \right) = \frac{2\gamma _{SL}\gamma _{SS}\cos \theta }{{r}}$

where $\gamma \left( \theta \right)$ is the interfacial tension between the solid-liquid and solid-solid interfaces, $\theta$ is the contact angle, and $r$ is the radius of the neck.

Since we have the contact angles for both solid-solid and solid-liquid interfaces, we can calculate the contact angle for the three-phase contact line using Young's equation:

$\cos \theta = \frac{{\gamma _{SS} - \gamma _{SL}}}{{\gamma _{LV}}}$

where $\gamma _{LV}$ is the liquid-vapor interfacial energy.

First, we need to find the liquid-vapor interfacial energy. We can use the contact angle data for Ni on alumina and zirconia in vacuum (Figure 6-38b) to find the contact angle for Ni on SiC. Since SiC does not react with solid Ni but liquid Ni, we can assume that the contact angle for Ni on SiC in vacuum is the same as that for Ni on alumina or zirconia.

From the figure, we can see that the contact angle for Ni on alumina and zirconia in vacuum is about 130 degrees. Using Young's equation, we can find that $\gamma _{LV} = \gamma _{Ni/vacuum} \cdot \cos \theta = 0.1 \cdot \cos 130^\circ \approx 0.051 J.m^{-2}$.

Now we can calculate the contact angle for the three-phase contact line using the given contact angles and Young's equation:

$\cos \theta = \frac{{\gamma _{SS} - \gamma _{SL}}}{{\gamma _{LV}}}$

$\cos \theta = \frac{{\gamma _{SiC-SiC}} - \gamma _{SiC-Ni}}{{\gamma _{LV}}}$

$\cos \theta = \frac{{0.80 - 0.45}}{{0.051}}$

$\cos \theta \approx 5.88$

Since the contact angle cannot be greater than 180 degrees, this result is not physically meaningful. It seems that there is an error in the given contact angle data or the assumptions made about the interfacial energies.

Therefore, we cannot determine the answer based on the given information.",,,0,

First, let's calculate the heat released during the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen:

ΔH = $m_{CO} * ΔH°_(298)$ (CO → $CO_2$)

where $m_{CO}$ is the molar flow rate of CO.

ΔH = 1 kg-mol * (-282000 kJ/(kg-mol CO))

ΔH = -282000 kJ

ΔS = ΔS(heating) - ΔS(cooling)
ΔS = 36.86 J.K^(-1) - (-37.8 J.K^(-1))
ΔS = 74.66 J.K^(-1)

According to the third law of thermodynamics, the entropy of a perfect crystal at 0 K is zero. Therefore, the entropy of the transformation at 0 K is the difference of the entropy of the final state (monoclinic sulfur) and the entropy of the initial state (orthorhombic sulfur):

ΔS0 = S(monoclinic sulfur at 0 K) - S(orthorhombic sulfur at 0 K)

Since both the initial and final states are at 0 K, their entropies are both zero according to the third law. Therefore, the entropy change for the transformation at 0 K is also zero.

However, the given entropy changes are for the transformation at 368.5 K, not at 0 K. To apply the third law, we need to find the entropy of the transformation at 0 K, which can be calculated using the given entropy changes and the legendre transformation.

The legendre transformation is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that can be done by a system at constant temperature and pressure. It is used to calculate the entropy change for a reversible process at constant temperature and pressure, such as the transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5 K.

The entropy change for the transformation at 0 K can be calculated as follows:

ΔS0 = ΔH/T

The enthalpy change for the transformation at 368.5 K is given by the difference of the entropies of the final and products, multiplied by the temperature:

ΔH = ΔS(heating) × T
ΔH = 36.86 J.K^(-1) × 368.5 K
ΔH = 13,238.5 J

ΔS0 = ΔH/T
ΔS0 = 13,238.5 J / 368.5 K
ΔS0 = 36.03 J.K^(-1) (up to two decimal places)

Since we are given the surface energy γ and the change in volume free energy ΔGv, we can substitute these values into the equation and solve for the critical radius r, which will then give us the critical edge length of the cube-shaped nucleus.

First, we need to find the critical radius r*:

Now, we can find the critical edge length of a cube-shaped nucleus by taking the cube root of the critical radius:

l* = √[6 * r³]
l* = √[6 * (1.85 nm)³]

First, we need to calculate the volume fraction of solid phase (ε) by considering the fraction of tungsten grains and the fraction of nickel. Since the size of tungsten grains is given, we can calculate the volume fraction of tungsten (ωw) as:

ωw = (Volume of tungsten grains) / (Total volume)

Total volume = (Volume of tungsten grains) + (Volume of nickel)

Given, the size of tungsten grains is 40 µm, so the volume of one tungsten grain is:

Vw = (4/3) * π * (20 µm)^3 = 1.333 * 10^-12 m^3

Assuming the size of nickel particles is much smaller than tungsten grains, we can consider the volume of nickel as negligible. Therefore, the volume fraction of solid phase (ε) is equal to the volume fraction of tungsten (ωw):

ε = ωw = (Volume of tungsten grains) / (Total volume) = Vw / (Vw + Vn)

Since Vn is negligible, ε ≈ 1.

Now, we can calculate the surface energy (γ) using the given interfacial energies:

γtungsten-tungsten = 0.52 J.m^-2
γtungsten-nickel = 0.30 J.m^-2

The total surface energy per unit area (γtotal) is given by:

γtotal = γtungsten-tungsten * ωw * 2 + γtungsten-nickel * ωnickel * 2

To determine the percentage change in the energy barrier, we can use the following equation:

Δ(ΔG) / ΔG = Δ(γls) / γls

Substituting the given values:

Δ(ΔG) / ΔG = 0.1 / γls

Since we don't have a specific value for γls, we cannot directly calculate the percentage change in the energy barrier. However, we can express the answer in terms of γls:

(A) If γls = 1 J/m², then Δ(ΔG) / ΔG = 0.1 / 1 = 0.1 or 10%
(B) If we assume that the percentage change in the energy barrier is proportional to the percentage change in the interfacial energy, then:

Δ(ΔG) / ΔG = Δ(γls) / γls = 0.1

Multiplying both sides by ΔG / Δ(ΔG) to get the percentage change in the energy barrier:

Δ(ΔG) / ΔG = 0.1 / γls * ΔG / Δ(ΔG)

Since ΔG / Δ(ΔG) is the ratio of the energy barrier to its change, it is typically a large number. For example, if ΔG / Δ(ΔG) = 1000, then:

Δ(ΔG) / ΔG = 0.1 / γls * 1000

Δ(ΔG) / ΔG = 1000 * 0.0001 = 1%

So, ln($𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)$) = 0.875 * $(1 − 0.7)^2$ = 0.875 * 0.09 = 0.07853

Now, we can calculate the activity of Zn using the Raoult's law equation:

$𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=0.7)$ = $𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=0.7)$ * $𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=1.0)$


We are given that $𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=1.0 = 3.6 * $10^(−4)$ atm.

So, we need to find $𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=0.7)$. Using the given approximation for $𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)$, we have:

ln($𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)$) = 0.07853

$𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)$ = exp(0.07853) = 1.0815

Now, we can calculate the activity of Zn:

$𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=0.7)$ = 1.0815 * $𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=1.0

$𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=0.7)$ = 1.0815 * 3.6 * $10^(−4)$ atm = 3.85 * $10^(−4)$ atm

Finally, we can calculate the ratio of vapor pressures:

[ $𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=0.7)/$𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=1.0)$] = [ 3.85 * $10^(−4)$ atm / 3.6 * $10^(−4)$ atm ] = 1.064

where:
- Pz is the partial pressure of zinc
- γzb is the Henry's law coefficient for zinc
- Xz is the mole fraction of zinc in the solution
- P° is the vapor pressure of pure zinc

dUe = Gb²(0.7)L = (82 GPa)(0.2856 nm)²(0.7)(100 nm) = 1.13 × 10^-10 J/m

U = ρdUe = (10^(15) m^-2)(1.13 × 10^-10 J/m) = 1.13 × 10^-1 J

Explanation:

When $C_(3)H_(8)$ is burnt with stoichiometric amount of oxygen, the combustion reaction is complete and the adiabatic flame temperature is determined solely by the heat released during the reaction. However, when excess oxygen is present, some of the heat is used to heat up the excess oxygen, which raises the temperature less than it would be with stoichiometric conditions.

(C) 4 hours. (D) 16 hours. ","To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the temperature distribution in a sphere is given by Eq. (6.16) in the text, which relates the temperature at a given radius and time to the thermal diffusivity, initial temperature difference, and time.

Let's denote the radius of both spheres as r, and the thermal diffusivity of sphere X as αx and that of sphere Y as αy. We are given that the center of sphere X reaches a temperature of 800K in 1 hour. Using Eq. (6.16), we can write:

Tx(rx, 1h) = 800K

Now, we want to find the time it takes for the center of sphere Y to reach the same temperature, Ty(ry, t). We can write:

Ty(ry, t) = 800K

To find the time t for sphere Y, we can set up the equation:

Tx(rx, 1h) = Ty(ry, t)

Using Eq. (6.16) for both spheres, we get:

(Tf - To) / [1 - exp(-αx * (1h)² / r²)] = (Tf - To) / [1 - exp(-αy * t² / r²)]

Since both spheres have the same diameter and are initially at the same temperature To, we can simplify the equation by canceling the common terms:

1 / [1 - exp(-αx * (1h)² / r²)] = 1 / [1 - exp(-αy * t² / r²)]

Now, we can solve for t by taking the reciprocal of both sides and taking the natural logarithm:

ln[1 - exp(-αy * t² / r²)] = ln[1 - exp(-αx * (1h)² / r²)] + ln(1/αy)

Using the property of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as:

ln[1 - exp(-αy * t² / r²)] = ln[1 - exp(-αx * (1h)² / r²)] + ln(αx / αy) + ln[1 - exp(-αx * (1h)² / r²)]

Since the first and last terms on the right-hand side are equal (both equal to ln[1 - exp(-αx)]), we can simplify the equation:

ln[1 - exp(-αy * t² / r²)] = ln(αx / αy)

To find t, we can use numerical methods to find the value of t that satisfies this equation. However, we can make some rough estimates based on the given thermal diffusivities.

Since αy is smaller than αx, it will take longer for sphere Y to heat up. In fact, the ratio of the heating times is approximately the square root of the ratio of the thermal diffusivities:

t / (1h) ≈ √(αx / αy)

Plugging in the values, we get:

t / (1h) ≈ √(100 * $10^(-6)m^(2)s^(-1) / 25 * $10^(-6)m^(2)s^(-1))

t ≈ 1.54 hours

Since the answer must be a multiple of 1 hour, the closest answer is (C) 4 hours. However, this is an approximation, and the exact answer can be found by solving the equation numerically.",,,0,

(A) 25 (B) 38 (C) 62 (D) 75","To determine the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy, we need to use the lever rule. The lever rule states that the weight fraction of each phase in equilibrium is proportional to the weight fraction of the constituent element in each phase.

First, let's find the weight fractions of the phases in equilibrium at the eutectic temperature of 561°C. We are given the weight percentages of Sn in each phase, so we can calculate the weight fractions as follows:

α-phase: 14.48 wt.% Sn → xα = 0.14.148
Mg2Sn: 63.02 wt.% Sn → xMg2Sn = 0.6302

Now, we can use the lever rule to find the weight fraction of each phase in the alloy with a 50 wt.% Sn composition:

The total weight of the alloy is 100 g, and the weight of Sn is 50 g. The weight of Mg is therefore 50 g - 50 g x 0.5 = 25 g.

The weight of the α-phase can be found by using the weight fraction of Sn in the α-phase and the total weight of the alloy:

weight of α-phase = 25 g x 0.01448 = 0.3615 g

The weight of Mg2Sn can be found by using the weight fraction of Sn in Mg2Sn and the total weight of the alloy:

weight of Mg2Sn = 25 g x 0.6302 = 15.755 g

Now, we can find the weight fractions of each phase in the alloy:

weight fraction of α-phase = weight of α-phase / total weight of alloy = 0.3615 g / 100 g = 0.003615
weight fraction of Mg2Sn = weight of Mg2Sn / total weight of alloy = 15.755 g / 100 g = 0.15755

To find the weight percentage of eutectic constituent present in the alloy, we need to multiply the weight fraction of the α-phase by its Sn content:

weight percentage of eutectic constituent = weight fraction of α-phase x weight percentage of Sn in α-phase x 100%
= 0.003615 x 0.1448 x 100%
= 0.00528%

To convert this to a weight percentage, we need to multiply by 10,000:

weight percentage of eutectic constituent ≈ 0.053%

The assertion [a] states that low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often have additions of strong carbide-forming elements.

The reason [r] given is that during creep deformation, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix, lose coherency.

(A) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$ (B) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ > $X_B$ (C) If $ΔH_(mix)$ > 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$ (D) If $ΔH_(mix)$ < 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$","The correct answer is (C) If $ΔH_(mix)$ > 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$.

Explanation:

For a dilute solution of B in A, the activity of B, $a_B$, can be approximated using Henry's law, which states that $a_B$ is proportional to the mole fraction of B, $X_B$. However, the activity coefﬁcient, $\gamma_B$, which relates the activity to the mole fraction, may deviate from unity due to intermolecular interactions between A and B.

The mixing enthalpy, $ΔH_(mix)$, represents the heat released or absorbed when one mole of A and one mole of B are mixed at constant temperature and pressure. If $ΔH_(mix)$ is positive, the mixing process is endothermic, meaning that heat is absorbed, and if it is negative, the mixing process is exothermic, meaning that heat is released.

In a dilute solution, the activity of B is approximately equal to its mole fraction, $X_B$, when the solution is ideal. However, for a real solution, the activity may deviate from the mole fraction due to intermolecular interactions.

When $ΔH_(mix)$ is positive, the solution is non-ideal, and the activity of B, $a_B$, is expected to be lower than its mole fraction, $X_B$, due to the endothermic nature of the mixing process. This is because the energy required to mix the components raises the temperature of the solution, which decreases the activity of the solute, B, due to the temperature dependence of the activity.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) If $ΔH_(mix)$ > 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$.",,,0,

If the surface energy increases by 20%, the new surface energy is 1.2γ. The change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume remains the same, so ΔGo is still the same. Therefore, the new critical radius is:

rc_new = -2(1.2γ)/ΔGo

To find the percentage increase in the critical radius, we can first find the ratio of the new critical radius to the old critical radius:

rc_new/rc = (-2(1.2γ)/ΔGo) / (-2γ/ΔGo)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

rc_new/rc = 1.2

So the new critical radius is 1.2 times the old critical radius. To find the percentage increase, we can take the difference between the new and old critical radii and divide by the old critical radius:

% increase = ((rc_new - rc) / rc) × 100%

% increase = ((1.2rc_1.2 × r_c) - r_c) / r_c × 100%

% increase = (2.2r_c - r_c) / r_c × 100%

% increase = 120%

However, this result is not physically meaningful, as the critical radius cannot be more than twice the old critical radius. This indicates that the assumption of a 20% increase in surface energy leading to a 120% increase in critical radius is not valid.

Therefore, the answer to the question is not provided in this context. The relationship between the critical radius and surface energy is more complex than a simple proportionality, and the assumption of a 120% increase in critical radius based on a 20% increase in surface energy is not valid.",,,0,

What is the change in the enthalpy of pure iron (in J/mol) when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C?," To find the change in enthalpy of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C, we need to integrate the specific heat function with respect to temperature over the given temperature range.

First, let's find the specific heat at 25°C and 700°C:

At 25°C: $C_{p,25}$ = 17.49 J/(mol.K)
At 700°C: $C_{p,700}$ = 17.49 + 24.77 * $10^(-3)*700$ = 17.49 + 24.77 = 42.26 J/(mol.K)

Now, we can integrate the specific heat function with respect to temperature:

$ΔH$ = $\int_{298.15}^{700} C_p dT$

Using the given specific heat function:

$ΔH$ = $\int_{298.15}^{700} (17.49 + 24.77 * 10^{-3}*T) dT$

Integrating term by term:

$ΔH$ = $\int_{298.15}^{700} 17.49 dT + \int_{298.15}^{700} 24.77 * 10^{-3}*T dT$

Integrating the first term:

$ΔH_{1}$ = $17.49 * (T - 298.15)$

Integrating the second term:

$ΔH_{2}$ = $24.77 * 10^{-3} * \frac{1}{2} * (T^2 - (298.15)^2)$

Adding the two integrals:

$ΔH$ = $17.49 * (T - 298.15) + 24.77 * 10^{-3} * \frac{1}{2} * (T^2 - (298.15)^2)$

Now, we can find the change in enthalpy when heating from 25°C to 700°C by evaluating the integral at the given temperature range:

$ΔH$ = $17.49 * (700 - 298.15) + 24.77 * 10^{-3} * \frac{1}{2} * (700^2 - (298.15)^2)$

$𝜆 = −𝜇𝜆𝐺° = −(−8000\text{ J/mol}) = 8000\text{ J/mol}$

Next, we can substitute the given values into the equation for $K\_c$:

$ln(𝑝_(C{O}_2)/𝑝_(CO)) = ln(K\_c) = −𝜆𝜃/(RT)$

$ln(𝑝_(C{O}_2)/𝑝_(CO)) = −(8000\text{ J/mol})(1200\text{ K})/(8.314\text{ J }mol^(-1)K^(-1})(1.380649\times 10^(-23)\text{ J/K})$

$ln(𝑝_(C{O}_2)/𝑝_(CO)) = −1.12\times 10^5$

To find $𝑝_(C{O}_2)/𝑝_(CO)$, we can take the exponential of both sides:

$𝑝_(C{O}_2)/𝑝_(CO) = e^{−1.12\times 10^5} = 1.15\times 10^(-221.8)$

Therefore, the equilibrium ratio is very small, which means that under the given conditions, $Fe_(3)O_(4)$ is more likely to react with $CO$ to form $3FeO$ and $CO_2$. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes ideal gas behavior and does not take into account the fact that $Fe_(3)O_(4)$ and $FeO$ are solids, which can affect the actual behavior of the system. In practice, the reaction may not proceed as predicted based on ideal gas behavior alone.",,,0,

On the other hand, if the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, the free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for solidification is ?","To find the free energy change for solidification when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, we can use the given information given for the case when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1256 K and the melting point of the metal, which is 1356 K.

First, let's calculate the undercooling temperature, $∆T$, for both cases:

For $T$ = 1256 K:
$∆T$ = $T_{melt}$ - $T$ = 1356 K - 1256 K = 100 K

For $T$ = 1200 K:
$∆Tmelt = 1356 K, T = 1200 K, ∆T = ?

Since we know that the free energy change for solidification is proportional to the undercooling temperature, we can set up a proportion:

$∆G^(L→S)$ (1256 K) / $∆T$ (1256 K) = $∆G^(L→S)$ (1200 K) / $∆T$ (1200 K)

We are given the values for the left side of the proportion:

$∆G^(L→S)$ (1256 K) = -1000 J $mol^(-1)$
$∆T$ (1256 K) = 100 K

So, we need to find $∆T$ (1200 K) and $∆G^(L→S)$ (1200 K) to complete the proportion.

To find $∆T$ (1200 K), we can use the given melting point and calculate the undercooling temperature:

$∆T$ (1200 K) = $T_{melt}$ - $T$ = 1356 K - 1200 K = 156 K

Now, we can set up the proportion:

$-1000 J $mol^(-1)$ / 100 K = $∆G^(L→S)$ (1200 K) / 156 K

To find $∆G^(L→S)$ (1200 K), we can cross-multiply and solve for it:



$∆G^(L→S)$ (1200 K) = $-1000 J $mol^(-1)$ * 156 K / 100 K
$∆G^(L→S)$ (1200 K) = $-1560 J $mol^(-1)$

So, the free energy change for solidification when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K is $-1560 J $mol^(-1)$.",,,0,

Given that the latent heat of fusion is 3 × $10^(5) J $kg^(-1)$ and the total rate of heat removal by the mould is 4.2 × $10^6$ W, the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is?"," To find the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit, we need to first find the rate of heat removal per unit area at the mould-metal interface and then use the energy balance equation.

From the given information, we have:

Mass flow rate of metal = 35 kg/s
Latent heat of fusion = 3 × 10^(5) J/kg
Total rate of heat removal by the mould = 4.2 × 10^6 W

Let the area of the mould-metal interface be A. Then, the rate of heat removal per unit area is given by:

q = Total rate of heat removal / Area
q = 4.2 × 10^6 W / A

Now, let the mass of solid and liquid at the mould exit be m_s and m_l, respectively. The energy balance equation at the mould exit can be written as:

m_s × Latent heat of fusion + m_l × Specific heat × Temperature difference = Heat removed by the mould

Let the temperature difference between the solid and liquid be ΔT. Then,

m_s × 3 × 10^(5) J/kg + m_l × Specific heat × ΔT = 4.2 × 10^6 W × Time

Since the solid and liquid remain at the melting point, their temperature difference is given by:

ΔT = Latent heat of fusion / Specific heat
ΔT = 3 × 10^(5) J/kg / Specific heat

Substituting this value in the energy balance equation, we get:

m_s × 3 × 10^(5) J/kg + m_l × (3 × 10^(5) J/kg) / (Specific heat) = 4.2 × 10^6 W × Time

Let x be the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit. Then, m_s = x × 35 kg/s and m_l = (1 - x) × 35 kg/s. Substituting these values in the energy balance equation, we get:

x × 35 kg/s × 3 × 10^(5) J/kg + (1 - x) × 35 kg/s × Specific heat × (3 × 10^(5) J/kg) / Specific heat = 4.2 × 10^6 W × Time

Solving for x, we get:

x = [4.2 × 10^6 W × Time / (35 kg/s × 3 × 10^(5) J/kg + 35 kg/s × (3 × 10^(5) J/kg) / Specific heat)]

To find the exact value of x, we need to know the value of Time or Specific heat. Without this information, we cannot find the exact value of x. However, we can express x in terms of Time or Specific heat.

Therefore, the answer is: The mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is a function of Time or Specific heat.",,,0,

Given that the activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution in Fe is $10^(-3)$, the standard Gibbs free energy change (in kJ) for this equilibrium is?","To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for the given equilibrium, we can be used the following equation:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

where K is the equilibrium constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

First, we need to calculate the activity of Si at 1 wt.% concentration using the given activity coefficient:

aSi = xSi * fSi

where xSi is the mole fraction of Si in the solution, and fSi is the activity coefficient.

xSi = 1 g / (1 g + 99.999 g) = 1 / (100.001) = 0.001

aSi = 0.001 * $10^(-3)$ = $10^(-6)$

Next, we can calculate the equilibrium constant using the given activity and the activity coefficient at infinite dilution:

K = aSi / (1 - aSi)

K = $10^(-6)$ / (1 - $10^(-6)$) = $10^(-6)$ / 0.99999 = $1.00001 * $10.0.001 = 1.00001

Now, we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

ΔG° = -(8.314 J/mol K) * (298.15 K) * ln(1.00001)

ΔG° = -(8.314 J/mol K) * (298.15 K) * (-2.3026 * 10^-5)



ΔG° = 1.352 * 10^-3 J/mol

To convert J/mol to kJ, we need to divide by 1000:

ΔG° = 1.352 * 10^-3 J/mol / 1000 = 1.352 * 10^-6 kJ/mol

Therefore, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the given equilibrium is approximately 1.352 * 10^-6 kJ/mol.",,,0,

First, let's calculate the new equilibrium constant (K) using the given temperature (T) and the initial and final partial pressures (p1 and p2):

ln(K) = ln(p1/p2) = ln(1 mbar/0.7 mbar) = 0.1053

Now, we can calculate the new equilibrium constant (K) using the ideal gas law:

K = (p1/p2)³/(RT)³ = (1 mbar/0.7 mbar)³/(8.314 J/mol·K·(1873 K))³ = 0.0115

Next, we can find the new nitrogen mole fraction (xN2) using the new partial pressure (pN2) and the total number of moles (nTotal):

xN2 = pN2/(pN2 + Σpi) = pN2/(pN2 + Σpi) = 0.0014

where Σpi is the sum of the partial pressures of all other gases in the system.

Since we don't have the information about the other gases, we cannot calculate the exact value of Σpi. However, we can express the new nitrogen content as a percentage of the total number of moles:

New nitrogen content = xN2 × nTotal = 0.0014 × nTotal = 1.4 ppm

So, the new equilibrium nitrogen content in the steel is 1.4 ppm.",,,0,

where:
- ε is the emissivity of steel (0.8)
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.7 * $10^(-8) W.m^(-2).k^(-4))
- A is the surface area of the top surface of the slab (1 m^2)

We can use the given data and the equation:

$$\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ$$

First, we need to calculate $\Delta H^\circ$ and $\Delta S^\circ$ at 500 K:

$$\Delta H^\circ_{500K} = \Delta H^\circ_{298K} + \int_{298K}^{500K} \Delta C_p dT$$

$$\Delta S^\circ_{500K} = \Delta S^\circ_{298K} + \int_{298K}^{500K} \Delta C_p \frac{dT}{T}$$

We are given that $\Delta H^\circ$ = −61080 J and $\Delta S^\circ$ = −132.22 J $K^(−1)$. We also know that $\Delta C_p$ is the difference in the specific heats of products and reactants. Since the reactants and products are pure solids, their specific heats are approximately constant in the given temperature range. Therefore, we can assume that $\Delta C_p$ is constant.

Let's assume that $\Delta C_p$ = $c_p^{Ag_2O} - c_p^{Ag}$ = $x$ J $K^(−1)$. We can then calculate $\Delta H^\circ_{500K}$ and $\Delta S^\circ_{500K}$ as follows:

$$0 = -61080 + x(500-298) - 500[-132.22 + x\ln\left(\frac{500}{298}\right)]$$

Assume that the system containing the two pieces of copper remains isolated during this process. A 1 mol piece of copper at 400 K is brought in contact with another 1 mol piece of copper at 300 K, and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. The entropy(in J $K^(-1)$ to three decimal places) change for this process is? ","To calculate the entropy change for the given process, we can use the formula for the entropy change of a closed system:

ΔS = Σn i (Sfi - Si)

where Si and Sfi are the final and initial entropies of the i-th substance, respectively. In this case, we have two moles of copper (substance i = 1) undergoing a reversible isothermal process at temperature T. Since the process is isothermal, the entropy change of each mole of copper can be calculated using the formula:

ΔSi = Cp ln(Tf/Ti)

where Cp is the specific heat capacity of copper and Tf and Ti are the final and initial temperatures, respectively.

Given that the system remains isolated during the process, the initial and final entropies of the copper must be equal, and the entropy change of the system is zero. However, the entropy of the surroundings also changes during the process, and we can calculate it using the given information.

First, let's calculate the final temperature Tf of the two pieces of copper after they reach thermal equilibrium. Since the system is isolated, the initial internal energy Ui must be equal to the final internal energy Uf. We can use the formula for the internal energy of a closed system:

Ui = Σn i (1/2 mi Cp i Ti2)

where mi is the mass of the i-th substance and Ti is its temperature. Since we have two moles of copper, each with a mass of 63.55 g (molar mass of copper = 63.55 g/mol), the initial internal energy is:

Ui = 2 × (1/2 × 63.55 g/mol × 22.6 J/g K × 400 K2) = 1.12 × 105 J

The final internal energy Uf can be calculated using the same formula, but with the final temperatures Ti = Tf:

Uf = 2 × (1/2 × 63.55 g/mol × 22.6 J/g K × Tf2)

Since Ui = Uf, we can set up the equation:

1.12 × 105 J = 2 × (1/2 × 63.55 g/mol × 22.6 J/g K−1mol−1 × Tf2)

Solving for Tf, we get:

Tf = 510.1 K

Now, we can calculate the entropy change of the surroundings using the formula:

ΔSsurr = Σn i (Si,fi - Si,i)

where Si,i and Si,fi are the initial and final entropies of the i-th substance, respectively. Since the copper is an ideal monatomic gas, we can use the formula for the entropy change of an ideal gas:

ΔSi = n R ln(Tf/Ti)

where n is the number of moles and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K).

For the first piece of copper (i = 1), the initial and final entropies are the same, so the entropy change is zero. For the second piece of copper (i = 2), we have:

Si,1i = 1 × 8.314 J/mol K × ln(510.1 K/300 K) = 1.3.03 J/mol

Si,1fi = 1 × 8.314 J/mol K × ln(510.1 K/400 K) = 1.18 J/mol

ΔSi,1 = Si,1fi - Si,1i = (1.18 - 1.303) J/mol = -0.123 J/mol

Since the entropy of the surroundings decreases during the process, the entropy change of the system plus surroundings is negative. However, since the given that the system remains isolated during the process, the entropy change of the system is zero, and the entropy change of the surroundings must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the entropy change of the system. Therefore, the entropy change of the system plus surroundings is zero.

Therefore, the answer is:

where K is the equilibrium constant and R is the gas constant. Since the reaction is at constant temperature (973 K), we can use the equation:

ΔG° = -RT ln(P_(O\_2)$/($P_(SO\_2)$)^0.5)

Solving for ln(P_(O\_2)$/($P_(SO\_2)$)^0.5), we get:

We are given the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\Delta_rG^\circ$, and the activities of MoO2, so we need to find the equilibrium constant, $K_p$, and then use it to find the partial pressures ratio.

First, let's calculate the equilibrium constant, $K_p$:

$K_p = e^{\frac{-\Delta_rG^\circ}{RT}}$

$K_p = e^{\frac{-(-120860J)}{(8.314J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1}) \times 1873K}}$

ΔHm(Ag-Ag) = 0 J.mol^(-1)
ΔHm(Au-Ag) = (−8300 J.mol^(-1))/2 = -4150 J.mol^(-1)

Air at 300 K is passed at a mass flow rate of 1.5 $kg.s^(-1)$ through a metallic tube of inner diameter 0.08 m. Inner wall temperature of the tube is maintained at 700 K. Temperature of the air leaving the tube is 600 K. Assuming that heat transfer occurs entirely by steady state convection, length of the tube(in metres) is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ","To find the length of the tube, we need to use the energy balance equation for steady-state convection. The energy balance equation states that the rate of heat transfer from the tube wall to the air is equal to the rate of heat transfer from the air to the fluid inside the tube.

The rate of heat transfer from the tube wall to the air can be calculated using the given coefficient of convective heat transfer, the area of the tube, and the temperature difference between the tube wall and the air.

The rate of heat transfer from the air to the fluid inside the tube can be calculated using the mass flow rate of the air, the specific heat capacity of air, and the temperature difference between the air entering and leaving the tube.

Once we have calculated both rates of heat transfer, we can set them equal to each other and solve for the length of the tube.

First, let's calculate the rate of heat transfer from the tube wall to the air:

q = h * A

where h is the coefficient of convective heat transfer, A is the area of the tube, and q is the rate of heat transfer.

A = π * (d/2)^2

where d is the diameter of the tube.

Substituting the given values, we get:

A = π * (0.08 m)^2 = 0.0314 m^2

q = 500 $W.m^(-2).K^(-1)$ * 0.0314 m^2 = 15.7 $W$

Next, let's calculate the rate of heat transfer from the air to the fluid inside the tube:

m = ρ * v * A

where m is the mass rate of flow, ρ is the density of air, v is the velocity of the air, and A is the area of the tube.

The velocity of the air can be calculated using the given mass flow rate and the density of air:

v = m / (ρ * A)

Substituting the given values, we get:

The temperature difference between the air entering and leaving the tube can be calculated using the given temperatures:

ΔT = T_out - T_in = 600 K - 300 K = 300 K

The rate of heat transfer from the air to the fluid inside the tube can be calculated using the given specific heat capacity of air and the mass rate of flow:

q = m * Cp * ΔT

Substituting the given values, we get:

q = 1.5 $kg.s^(-1)$ * 1080 $J.kg^(-1).K^(-1)$ * 300 K = 5135 $W$

Setting the rates of heat transfer equal to each other and solving for the length of the tube, we get:

15.7 $W$ = 5135 $W$ / (π * (d/2)^2)

Solving for d, we get:

d = 0.061 m

Substituting the value of d back into the equation for the area of the tube, we get:

A = π * (0.061 m)^2 = 0.0157 m^2

Finally, we can calculate the length of the tube by dividing the rate of heat transfer from the tube wall to the air by the rate of heat transfer from the air to the fluid inside the tube:

L = q / q

Substituting the calculated values, we get:

L = ≈ 0.003 m

h = 1
k = 1
l = 0

d = a√(h² + k² + l²) = a√(1² + 1² + 0²) = a

d = 4.988 Å

sinθ = λ / (2d)

θ = sin⁻¹(λ / (2d))

θ = sin⁻¹(1.54 Å / (2 × 4.988 Å))

θ = sin⁻¹(0.152) ≈ 0.2866 radians

Atomic structure,11,G-XEC-2015-64-21,NUM,30,Calculate the density of copper in kg $m^(-3)$ given that copper has an fcc lattice with a lattice parameter of 0.365 nm. Copper has an atomic weight of 63.54 amu,"To calculate the density of copper, we first need to find the mass of one unit cell and then divide it by the volume of the unit cell.

The mass of one unit cell is given by the sum of the masses of all the atoms in the unit cell. Since copper has an fcc lattice with four atoms per unit cell, we have:

m_unit_cell = 4 × m_copper_atom

The mass of a copper atom is given in amu, so we need to convert it to kg:

m_copper_atom = 63.54 amu × 1.66054 × 10^-27 kg/amu = 1.0811 × 10^-22 kg

Now we can calculate the mass of one unit cell:

m_unit_cell = 4 × 1.0811 × 10^-22 kg = 4.3244 × 10^-22 kg

The volume of the unit cell is given by:

V_unit_cell = a^3

where a is the lattice parameter. We are given that a = 0.365 nm = 0.365 × 10^-9 m.

V_unit_cell = (0.365 × 10^-9 m)^3 = 4.113 × 10^-29 m^3

Now we can calculate the density:

ρ = m_unit_cell / V_unit_cell = 4.3244 × 10^-22 kg / (4.113 × 10^-29 m^3) = 1.05 × 10^3 kg/m^3

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and sinθ is the sine of the diffraction angle θ.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d. Using the lattice parameter a, we can calculate the interplanar spacing using the following formula:

d = a/√(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices. For the first diffraction peak, h, k, and l are usually (110), so:

d = 4.1 Å/√(1² + 1² + 0²) = 2.025 Å

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the diffraction angle θ:

1.54 Å = 2 × 2.025 Å × sinθ

Solving for sinθ:

sinθ = 1.54 Å/(2 × 2.025 Å) = 0.361

To find the angle θ in degrees, we can use the inverse sine function:

θ = sin⁻¹(0.361) ≈ 21.1°

Explanation:

(i) Polymers that are less coiled are more likely to form regular conformations and configurations, which favor crystallization. Therefore, they are more likely to be crystalline.

(ii) Branched polymers have more complex structures and are less likely to form regular conformations and configurations, which makes it harder for them to crystallize. Therefore, they are less crystalline than linear polymers.

(iii) Inter-chain interactions increase the strength of the intermolecular bonds between the chains, which can increase the glass transition temperature by making it harder for the chains to move past each other.

(iv) However, inter-chain interactions can also hinder the movement of the chains, making it more difficult for them to rearrange and form crystalline regions. Therefore, polymers with inter-chain interactions are not necessarily more crystalline than those without inter-chain interactions.

First, let's calculate the molecular weight of one repeat unit (Mr) using the given degree of polymerization:

Mr = (Mn / DP)

Since Mn = 10^(5) gmol^(-1), and DP = 2210,

Mr = (10^(5) gmol^(-1) / 2210)

Now, we need to find the molecular weight of each repeat unit. Let's assume that one repeat unit is ethylene, which has a molecular weight of 28 g/mol.

The molecular weight of the other repeat unit can be calculated as follows:

Mw_other = Mr - Mw_ethylene

Mw_other = (10^(5) gmol^(-1) / 2210) - 28 g/mol

To determine the structure of the other repeat unit, we need to find its molecular formula based on its molecular weight. We can use the atomic weights of C, H, F, and Cl to calculate the number of each atom in the repeat unit.

Let x be the number of carbon atoms, y be the number of hydrogen atoms, z be the number of fluorine atoms, and w be the number of chlorine atoms in the repeat unit.

We have the following equations:

x * 12 g/mol + y * 1 g/mol + z * 19 g/mol + w * 35.5 g/mol = Mr_other

x + y = 2 (since there are two carbon atoms in ethylene)

We can solve these equations to find the structure of the other repeat unit.

Let's try option B, $−CH_2−CHCl−$. The molecular weight of this repeat unit is 62 g/mol.

x = 2, y = 10, z = 1, w = 1

62 g/mol = 2 * 12 g/mol + 10 * 1 g/mol + 1 * 19 g/mol + 1 * 35.5 g/mol

62 g/mol = 24 g/mol + 10 g/mol + 19 g/mol + 35.5 g/mol

62 g/mol = 88.5 g/mol

This is not correct, so the other repeat unit is not $−CH_2−CHCl−$.

Let's try option C, $−CF_2−CF_2−$. The molecular weight of this repeat unit is 44 g/mol.

x = 2, y = 0, z = 4, w = 0

44 g/mol = 2 * 12 g/mol + 0 * 1 g/mol + 4 * 19 g/mol

44 g/mol = 48 g/mol - 4 g/mol

44 g/mol = 44 g/mol

This is correct, so the other repeat unit is $−CF_2−CF_2−$.

The density of states in a three dimensional solid varies with energy as $E^(-1/2)$. This is because of the presence of critical points in the energy band structure, where the density of states exhibits anomalous behavior as a function of energy. At these critical points, the density of states is expected to be singular, and the expected singularities are defined by equation (2.51), where the gradient of the energy with respect to the wave vector is zero. For these points, the density of states is expected to exhibit anomalies as a function of energy.

The schematic representation of two isoenergetic surfaces in the k-space, E(k)=E and E(k)=E+dE, is shown in Figure 2.21. The distance dk between the two isoenergetic surfaces is obtained by observing that dE=∇ kE(k)·dk=| ∇ kE(k)|dk.

Near a critical point, where Eq.(2.51) holds, we can expand the energy as a function of the wavevector, in quadratic form. Indicating with kx,ky,kz the principal axes of the quadratic form and taking the origin at the critical point itself, we have E(k)=Ec±ℏ2

First, we need to find the number of atoms in the unit cell. In a body centered cubic lattice, there are two types of atoms: those at the corners and those at the body center. The number of corner atoms is given by the number of unit cells in each dimension, which is 8, multiplied by the number of atoms per unit cell in each dimension, which is 1/2 (since each corner atom is shared by two unit cells). The number of body center atoms is  atoms is 1. Therefore, the total number of atoms in the unit cell is:

b = a√2

The area of the unit cell is then given by:

A = b² = a²√2

Finally, we can find the number of atoms per unit area by dividing the total number of atoms in the unit cell by the area of the unit cell:

ρ = N/A = 4.5 / (a²√2)

Explanation:

The number of close packed planes in the lattice of an FCC metal is six. This is because in an FCC lattice, each atom is surrounded by twelve nearest neighbors, and the close packed planes are the planes where the atoms are in contact with their twelve nearest neighbors. These planes are stacked in an ABC, ABC, ... sequence, where C is rotated by 2π/6 with respect to the B plane. Therefore, there are six close packed planes in the lattice.

If the energy of formation of vacancies in pure copper is 0.9 ev, the fraction of vacancies pure copper at 27 ° C will be x * $10^(-16)$. Find x. ","To find the fraction of vacancies in pure copper at 27°C, we can use the given equation for the chemical potential of vacancies at equilibrium:

μv = μo\_v + kBTln(nv/N)

where μv is the chemical potential of vacancies, μo\_v is the formation energy of a vacancy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and N is the total number of lattice sites.

We are given that μo\_v = 0.9 eV and T = 27°C + 273.15 = 297.15 K. We want to find nv/N, which is the fraction of vacancies.

First, we need to find the value of kBT at the given temperature:

kBT = 8.62 * $10^(-5)$eV/K * 297.15 K = 2.53 * $10^(-21)$J

Now, we can rearrange the equation for μv to solve for nv/N:

ln(nv/N) = (μo\_v - μv)/kBT

We are given that μv = 0 at equilibrium, so we can use this value to find nv/N:

ln(nv/N) = (μo\_v - 0)/kBT = μo\_v/(kBT)

To find x, we need to convert the given fraction to a decimal:

x = $10^(-16)$ = 1 * $10^(-16)$ = 1 * $10^(-14)$ = 1 * $10^(-12)$ * $10^(-2)$ = 1 * $10^(-12)$ * 0.0001 = 1 * 0.0001 * $10^(-12)$ = 1 * $10^(-14)$

Now, we can find nv/N by taking the exponential of both sides of the equation:

nv/N = exp(ln(nv/N)) = exp(μo\_v/(kBT))

To find the number of vacancies at any temperature, we need to calculate the concentration of vacancies at equilibrium and then use the given equation for the chemical potential of vacancies to find the concentration at the desired temperature.

First, we calculate the concentration of vacancies at equilibrium using the given equation:

n\_v = N * exp(-E\_f/kT)

where N is the total number of lattice sites, E\_f is the energy of formation of a vacancy, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

We are given that N = 10^22 sites/cm^3, E\_f = 0.9 eV, and T = 300 K.

First, we need to convert the given temperature to Kelvin:

T = 300 K + 273.15 K = 573.15 K

Now, we can calculate the concentration of vacancies at equilibrium:

n\_v = N * exp(-E\_f/kT) = 10^22 sites/cm^3 * exp(-0.9 eV/(8.62 * $10^(-5)$eV/K * 573.15 K)) = 1.16 * $10^(-4}$ sites/cm^3

Next, we need to find the concentration of vacancies at the desired temperature using the given equation for the chemical potential of vacancies:

ln(n\_v/N) = (μo\_v - μv)/kBT

where μo\_v is the formation energy of a vacancy, μv is the chemical potential of vacancies at the desired temperature, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

We are given that μo\_v = 0.9 eV and T = 90% of the melting temperature, which is 1358 K.

First, we need to find the value of kBT at the given temperature:

kBT = 8.62 * $10^(-5)$eV/K * 1358 K = 1.13 * $10^(-19)$J

The area of the unit cell in the (110) plane can be calculated using the lattice parameter a as follows:

Area = a^2 * sqrt(2) / 2

Substituting the value of a = 0.287 nm, we get:

Area = (0.287 nm)^2 * sqrt(2) / 2
Area = 0.115 nm^2

The planar atomic density is given by the number of atoms per unit area in the (110) plane. Since a BCC crystal contains two atoms per unit cell, the planar atomic density is:

Planar atomic density = 2 / Area

Substituting the value of Area, we get:

Planar atomic density = 2 / 0.115 nm^2

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing for the fourth reflection. In an FCC lattice, the interplanar spacing for the (hkl) reflection is given by:

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

For the fourth reflection, h = 2, k = 2, and l = 0. So,

d = a / √(2² + 2² + 0²) = a / √(4) = a / 2

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the Bragg angle:

2d sin θ = nλ
2(a / 2) sin θ = 4 × 1.54056 Å
sin θ = (4 × 1.54056 Å) / (2 × a)
sin θ = (6.16224 Å) / (2 × 3.5 Å)
sin θ = 0.3472
θ = sin⁻¹(0.3472)

Assume that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy. ","The surface energies for the {111} and {100} planes in an FCC metal are different due to the number of broken bonds per surface atom. For the {111} plane, there are six nearest neighbors in the plane, three above and three below, so three bonds are broken for each surface atom when the crystal is cut along this plane. For the {100} plane, there are four nearest neighbors in the plane, so four bonds are broken for each surface atom. Therefore, the surface energy for the {111} plane is smaller than that for the {100} plane.

The ratio of surface energy for the {111} surface to {100} surface can be calculated as follows:

Surface energy of {111} surface = energy required to break 3 bonds per surface atom
Surface energy of {100} surface = energy required to break 4 bonds per surface atom

Assuming that the energy to break one bond is a constant, we have:

Surface energy of {111} surface = 3 × energy to break one bond
Surface energy of {100} surface = 4 × energy to break one bond

The ratio of surface energy for the {111} surface to {100} surface is:

(round off to 2 decimal places) ","To find the density of austenite, we first need to determine the number of atoms in a unit cell and the total mass of the unit cell.

1. Calculate the number of atoms in a unit cell:
Since austenite has an fcc structure, there are 4 atoms in the unit cell. Two of these atoms are Fe atoms, and the other two are C atoms.

2. Calculate the total mass of the unit cell:
The total mass of mass of the total number of atoms in the unit cell is given by:

Total mass = (number of Fe atoms) × (atomic mass of Fe) + (number of C atoms) × (atomic mass of C)

Total mass = (2) × (55.8 g/mol) + (2) × (12.0 g/mol)

Total mass = 111.6 g/mol

3. Calculate the density of austenite:
The density is given by the total mass of the unit cell divided by the volume of the volume of the unit cell. Since the lattice parameter is given in Å, we need to convert it to m to find the volume.

Volume = (lattice parameter)³

Volume = (4 Å)³ = 64 Å³ = 64 × (1 × 10⁻⁹ m)³ = 6.626 × 10⁻⁹ m³

The enthalpy required to create an oxygen vacancy in $CeO_2$ is 4 eV. The number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K is? (Round off to the nearest integer)," To calculate the number of oxygen vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K, we can use the following equation:

$n = N \exp\left(-\frac{E}{k_BT}\right)$

where $n$ is the number of vacancies, $N$ is the total number of available sites, $E$ is the formation energy of the vacancy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

First, we need to find the total number of available oxygen sites per mole of $CeO_2$. Since $CeO_2$ has a formula unit of $CeO_2$, it contains 2 moles of oxygen per mole of $CeO_2$. Avogadro's number can be used to find the number of atoms in 1 mole of any substance.

$N = 2 \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} \times \frac{1}{1} = 1.204 \times 10^{24}$

Now we can calculate the number of oxygen vacancies using the given equation:

$n = 1.204 \times 10^{24} \times \exp\left(-\frac{4 \text{ eV}}{8.62 \times 10^{-5} \text{ eV/K} \times 1000 \text{ K}}\right)$

$n = 1.204 \times 10^{24} \times \exp\left(-\frac{6.704 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{8.62 \times 10^{-5} \text{ eV/K} \times 1000 \text{ K}}\right)$

$n = 1.204 \times 10^{24} \times \exp\left(-\frac{6.704 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{8.62 \times 10^{-5} \text{ eV/K} \times 8.62 \times 10^5 \text{ J/mol-K}}\right)$

$n = 1.204 \times 10^{24} \times \exp\left(-\frac{6.704 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{7.34 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}\right)$

$n = 1.204 \times 10^{24} \times \exp(-0.923)$

$n \approx 3.89 \times 10^{23}$

Since we are looking for the number of vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$, we need to divide the result by the total number of oxygen atoms in 1 mole of $CeO_2$:

$\frac{n}{N} = \frac{3.89 \times 10^{23}}{1.204 \times 10^{24}} \approx 0.032$

Therefore, the number of oxygen vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K is approximately 0.032 mol, or about 2 vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$. However, since vacancies are point defects, we cannot have a fraction of a vacancy. Therefore, we cannot have an exact number of vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$ at this temperature. We can only say that there are fewer than 2 vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$.

So, the answer is ""fewer than 2"" vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K.",,,0,

Given: n = 1, λ = 0.154 nm, θ = 78°

First, we need to find d, the interplanar spacing for the {311} planes in an fcc lattice. We can use the Miller indices to find the plane spacing using the lattice constant:

dhkl = λ / (2sinθ)

For {311} planes in an fcc lattice, the Miller indices can be related to the lattice constant a:

h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = a^2

Since h^2 + k^2 = 9 and l^2 = 1, we have:

a^2 = h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 10 + 1 = 11
a = sqrt(11)

Now, we can find d using the given diffraction angle and wavelength:

d = h/(2sinθ) = (1/2)(λ/sinθ) = (1/2)(0.154 nm / sin(78°))

To find the lattice parameter, we need to use the relationship between the lattice parameter and the plane spacing:

a = dhkl = d / |Fhkl|

We don't have the absolute value of the structure factor |Fhkl|, but we can calculate it using the atomic scattering factor f and the number of atoms per unit cell Z:

|Fhkl| = Z * f(hkl)

For an fcc lattice, Z = 4. We can assume that the atomic scattering factor f for the metal is approximately the same as that for a simple metal like copper, which is around 0.132.

|Fhkl| = 4 * 0.132 = 0.528

Now, we can find the lattice parameter:

a = d / |Fhkl| = d / 0.528 = d * 1.907 nm

Plugging in the value of d we calculated earlier:

a = d / |Fhkl| = (0.203 nm) / 0.528 = 0.385 nm

or0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.10 MN/$m^{(1.5)}$ * d^(-1/2)

or0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.10 MN/$m^{(1.5)}$ * 0.0326
or0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.0101 MN/$m^2$
or0 = 100.0101 MN/$m^2$

The calculated yield strength is slightly higher than the given value of 100 MN/$m^2$. However, since the given value is only an approximation for the yield strength of the material with ASTM No. 6 grain size, we can assume that the calculated value is within the acceptable range.

Atomic structure,55,G-META-13-54,MCQS-NUM,38,An edge dislocation is present in α-Fe. Atomic diameter of iron atom is 0.25 nm and its shear modulus is 70 GPa. Modulus of the Burgers vector (in nm) is  (A) 0.125 (B) 0.25 (C) 0.50 (D) 0.625 ,"The Burgers vector is related to the lattice parameter and shear modulus by the equation: b = √(2/2)·a, where a is the lattice parameter. In this case, the lattice parameter of α-Fe is 0.25 nm. Therefore, the magnitude of the Burgers vector is:

b = √(2/2)·a = √(2/2)·0.25 nm = 0.353 nm

To find the modulus of the Burgers vector, we need to find its components along the principal crystal axes. In the simple cubic lattice, the shortest lattice vector is associated with slip from a cube corner to a face center, and has components a/2, a/2, 0. Therefore, the Burgers vector in the α-Fe lattice can be written as:

b = a/2[1 1 0]

To find the modulus of the Burgers vector, we need to find the magnitude of the vector projected along each principal axis and then take the square root of the sum of these squares. However, since the Burgers vector is along the [1 1 0] direction, its components along the other two principal axes are zero. Therefore, the modulus of the Burgers vector is simply its magnitude along the [1 1 0] direction:

b = 0.353 nm

So, the answer is (B) 0.25 nm, but the correct answer is (C) 0.50 nm, since the question asks for the modulus of the Burgers vector, which is the square of its magnitude.",,,0,
Atomic structure,56,G-META-13-55,MCQS-NUM,45,An edge dislocation is present in α-Fe. Atomic diameter of iron atom is 0.25 nm and its shear modulus is 70 GPa. Energy (in J/m) of the dislocation is  (A) 0.5 * $10^(-9)$ (B) 1.1 * $10^(-9)$ (C) 2.2 * $10^(-9)$ (D) 4.4 * $10^(-9)$,"To calculate the energy of an edge dislocation in α-Fe, we can use the expression for the energy per unit length of an edge dislocation given by equation (9.23b) in the text:

dUe = Gb2 4π(1−υ)dr

where G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector, υ is the Poisson's ratio, and r is the radius of the dislocation core.

First, we need to find the value of the Burgers vector for iron. In simple cubic crystals, the Burgers vector can be defined as:

−→b = a[uvw]

where a is the atomic diameter and u, v, and w are the components of the Burgers vector in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. Since the crystal symmetry is cubic, the Burgers vector components can be chosen as:

b = a√u2+v2+w2

For iron, the atomic diameter is 0.25 nm, so:

b = a√(12+1+1) = a√14 = 0.353553 nm

Now, we can calculate the energy per unit length of the edge dislocation:

dUe = Gb2 4π(1−υ)dr

where G = 70 GPa = 70 × 109 N/m2, b = 0.353553 nm, υ = 1/3, and r is the radius of the dislocation core.

To find the value of r, we can use the expression for the energy per unit length of a dislocation given by equation (9.23c) in the text:

Ue = Gb2 4π(1−υ)ln(r/ro)

where ro is the core radius. Solving for r, we get:

r = ro e^(Ue/Gb2 4π(1−υ)ln)

Since the exact value of the core radius is not given in the text, we cannot calculate the energy directly using this method. However, we can make an estimate based on the given information.

The energy of an edge dislocation is typically about 4 eV per atom plane threaded by the dislocation. For iron, with a density of 7.87 g/cm3 and an atomic mass of 55.85 g/mol, the atomic mass density is 2.33 × 1024 kg/m3. The number of atoms in a cubic unit cell is given by:

N = (a3)/(a∥3)

where a is the lattice parameter and a∥ is the atomic diameter. For iron, the lattice parameter is 0.2866 nm, so:

N = (0.2866 nm)3/(0.25 nm)3 = 4.31 × 1022 atoms/m3

The energy of an edge dislocation threading through one unit cell is:

E = 4 eV/atom × 4.31 × 1022 atoms/m3 = 1.72 × 10-9 J/m

To find the energy per unit length of the dislocation, we need to estimate the area over which the dislocation is operative. For dislocation lines of sizes from 1 to 10 nm, we can estimate the area to be 10-12 to about 10-14 cm2. The force can be calculated using the area estimates and the expression F = s·A, where s is the shear modulus and A is the area. The energy can then be calculated as F·dx, where x is the magnitude of the distortion or the magnitude of the Burgers vector. We estimate this to be about 0.1 nm.

Using the given shear modulus of 70 GPa, we can calculate the energy per unit length:

dUe = F/A = (s·A)/A = s = 70 × 109 N/m2 = 7.0 × 10-9 J/m

Multiplying this by the length of the dislocation line, we get:

Ue = dUe × L = 7.0 × 10-9 J/m × L

Now, we can compare the energies of the given options to find the correct answer.

dhkl = 2π / ||ghkl|| = 1 / sqrt(h2(b1)2 + k2(b2)2 + l2(b3)2)

First, we need to calculate the mass of one atom:

Mass of one atom = Atomic weight
Mass of one atom = 183 g/mol

Next, we need to find the volume of the unit cell:

Volume of the unit cell = Lattice parameter^3
Volume of the unit cell = (0.4 nm)^3 = 0.00064 cubic nm

Now, we can calculate the number of atoms in the unit cell by dividing the total mass of the unit cell by the mass of one atom:

Total mass of the unit cell = Density × Volume of the unit cell
Total mass of the unit cell = 19000 kg/$m^3$ × 0.00064 cubicubic nm
Total mass of the unit cell = 121.76 kg

Number of atoms in the unit cell = 121.76 kg / 183 g/mol
Number of atoms in the unit cell = 0.665 icubic units

nλ = 2d sin θ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the diffraction angle. In this case, we are given the diffraction angle (2𝜃 = 68.7°) and the lattice parameter (a = 0.2887 nm). We can find the interplanar spacing (d) using the lattice parameter:

d = a / √h² + k² + l²

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the first peak. Since we don't have the Miller indices, we can't directly calculate the interplanar spacing. However, we can use the given diffraction angle to find the wavelength indirectly.

First, we need to find the sin θ value using the given 2𝜃 angle:

sin θ = sin(2𝜃 / 2) = sin(68.7° / 2) ≈ 0.622

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the wavelength:

nλ = 2d sin θ

We don't know the order of reflection (n), but we can solve for λ:

λ = 2d sin θ / n

Since we don't have the interplanar spacing (d), we can't directly calculate the wavelength. However, we can use the lattice parameter (a) and the given diffraction angle (2𝜃) to find an approximate value for d, and then use that to find an approximate value for λ.

First, we can find the interplanar spacing (d) using the lattice parameter (a):

d = a / √h² + k² + l²

Since we don't have the Miller indices (h, k, l), we can't directly calculate the interplanar spacing. However, we can use the given diffraction angle (2𝜃 = 68.7°) to find an approximate value for d.

The Miller indices (h, k, l) for the first peak in a powder diffraction pattern on BCC iron can be found by indexing the diffraction pattern. In this case, we are given the diffraction angle (2𝜃 = 68.7°), so we can't directly find the Miller indices without additional information.

To find the Miller indices, we would typically use a diffraction pattern indexing software or a set of tables that list the possible Miller indices for various diffraction angles and lattice types. Without this information, it's not possible to find the Miller indices directly.

However, we can still find an approximate value for the wavelength by using an approximate value for the interplanar spacing (d) based on the lattice parameter (a) and the given diffraction angle (2𝜃).

First, we can find an approximate value for the interplanar spacing (d) using the lattice parameter (a) and the given diffraction angle (2𝜃):

d = a / √h² + k² + l²

Since we don't have the Miller indices (h, k, l), we can use an approximate value for them based on the given lattice parameter (a) and the diffraction angle (2𝜃). For BCC iron, the first peak typically occurs for the (220) plane, so we can use approximate values for h, k, and l based on that:

d = a / √(2² + 2² + 0²) = a / √8 = a / √2 × √2 = a / √2 ≈ 0.173 nm

Now, we can use this approximate value for d to find an approximate value for the wavelength:

Explanation:

The assertion [a] is that the rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution of B in A is controlled by the diffusivity of B. This statement is generally true.

However, the reason [r] given is that ""Atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries."" This statement is not the correct reason for why the diffusivity of B controls the rate of homogenization.

The correct reason is that in a dilute substitutional solid solution, the diffusivity of B is the dominant factor controlling its transport in the matrix of A. The absence of dislocations and grain boundaries in a dilute solution is not the reason for this, but rather a consequence of the dilute concentration of B.

Therefore, the answer is (B) both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a].",,,0,
Atomic structure,82,G-META-21-15,NUM,60,Given: For the symmetric distribution: Probability P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98. The grain size (X) of annealed specimens follows a symmetric distribution with a mean (µ) of 5µm and a standard deviation (σ) of 0.5 µm. The percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is expected to be?(round off to nearest integer) ," To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm, we can use the z-score formula for a symmetric distribution:

z = (X - µ) / σ

We want to find the percentage of specimens with z between -1 and 1, which corresponds to the range µ - σ to µ + σ.

Using the given probability P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98, we can find the z-score corresponding to this probability using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator:

P(Z ≤ z) = 0.98
Z = z = ?

Using a calculator or a standard normal distribution table, we find that z = 1.28.

Now we can find the range of grain sizes corresponding to z = 1.28:

X = µ + zσ = 5 µm + 1.28 × 0.5 µm = 5.41 µm

To find the grain size range, we can use the same z-score and the formula for the range of X:

X1 = µ + zσ = 5 µm + 1.28 × 0.5 µm = 5.41 µm
X2 = µ + (-z)σ = 5 µm + (-1.28) × 0.5 µm = 4.59 µm

So the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is approximately:

(X2 - X1) / (µ + σ - µ + (-σ)) × 100% = (0.82 µm) / (1 µm) × 100% = 82%

The second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC metal occurs at what Bragg angle θ (in degrees)? (answer up to two decimal places),"To find the Bragg angle for the second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC metal, we can use Bragg's law:

2d sin θ = λ

where d is the interplanar spacing, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, and sin θ is the sine of half the scattering angle.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d using the lattice parameter a:

d = a√(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the second peak. Since the lattice is FCC, we can use the Miller indices for the (111) plane as a starting point and look for the next peak in the diffraction pattern.

The first peak in the FCC (111) pattern occurs at θ = 35.27°, so we can find the next peak by incrementing the Miller indices until we find the correct angle.

Let's assume the next peak has Miller indices (h, k, l) = (2, 2, 2). Then,

d = a√(2² + 2² + 2²) = a√(8) = a√2√2√2 = a√2√2 × a√2 = a√2

Now we can use Bragg's law to find the Bragg angle:

2d sin θ = λ

2a√2 sin θ = 0.154 nm

sin θ = 0.154 nm / (2a√2)

θ = sin⁻¹(0.154 nm / (2a√2))

θ = sin⁻¹(0.154 / (2 × 0.36 × √2))

θ = sin⁻¹(0.0235)

The number of atoms per unit area($nm^(-2)$) in (100) plane of Pb is?(round off to the nearest integer).","To find the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb, we first need to determine the area of the unit cell in the (100) plane. In an FCC lattice, the (100) plane is a square lattice, so the area of the unit cell in this plane is simply a^2, where a is the edge length of the cube.

The volume of the unit cell in an FCC lattice is given by V = a^3/4. We can find the edge length a by using the atomic radius r and the given formula for the volume of an FCC unit cell:

V = (4/3)πr^3

Solving for r, we get:

r = a/√2

Substituting the given value of r = 0.175 nm, we get:

a = √2 × 0.175 nm = 0.235 nm

Now, we can find the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane by dividing the total number of atoms in the unit cell by the area of the unit cell in the (100) plane:

Number of atoms per unit area = (Number of atoms in the unit cell) / (Area of the unit cell in the (100) plane)

The number of atoms in the FCC unit cell is given by:

Number of atoms = (4/3)πr^3/a^3 = (4/3)π(a/√2)^3/a^3 = (4/3)π(1/√2)^3 = 4

So, the number of atoms per unit cell is 4. Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane is:

Number of atoms per unit area = 4 / (a^2) = 4 / (0.235 nm)^2 ≈ 15.7 × 10^14 nm^-2

We are given n = 1, λ = 0.1543 nm, and θ = 24.65°. We need to find d.

First, calculate sinθ:

sinθ = sin(24.65°) ≈ 0.422

Next, calculate d:

d = nλ / (2sinθ)

d = (1) * (0.1543 nm) / (2 * 0.422)

d ≈ 0.289 nm

The Bragg angle(in degree) for the second reflection will be?(round off to 1 decimal places)"," To find the Bragg angle for the second reflection in the X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC crystal, we can use the Bragg equation:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the Bragg angle.

We are given that the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle of 30°, and the lattice parameter of the FCC crystal is 0.2866 nm. We can find the interplanar spacing using the lattice parameter and the Miller indices of the first reflection.

The Miller indices of the first reflection are not given directly, but we can determine them from the Bragg angle using the relationship:

dhkl = λ / (2sinθ)

where hkl are the Miller indices. Since the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle of 30°, we have:

dhkl = λ / (2sin30°) = λ / (2 x √3/2) = λ / (√3)

To find the Miller indices, we can use the relationship:

h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = (a / d)^2

where a is the lattice parameter. Substituting the given value of a and the calculated value of dhkl, we have:

h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = (0.2866 nm) ^2 / (dhkl) ^2 = (0.2866 nm) ^2 / (λ ^2 / (√3) ^2) = (√3 / λ) ^2

Solving for h^2, we get:

h^2 = (√3 / λ) ^2 - k^2 - l^2

Since the first reflection occurs at hkl = 111, we have:

h^2 = (√3 / 0.15418 nm) ^2 - k^2 - l^2 = 12.36 - k^2 - l^2

We can assume that the second reflection also occurs from the same family of planes, so the interplanar spacing d is the same. Therefore, we can use the Bragg equation to find the Bragg angle for the second reflection:

nλ = 2dsinθ

Solving for sinθ, we get:

sinθ = nλ / (2d)

Substituting the given value of λ and the calculated value of d, we have:

sinθ = 1 / (2 x 0.2866 nm / (√3 / 0.15418 nm)) x n

Solving for θ, we get:

θ = sin^-1 (n / (2 x 0.2866 nm / (√3 / 0.15418 nm)))

The enthalpy (in KJ $mol^(-1)$) of vacancy formation is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ,"To find the enthalpy of vacancy formation, we can use the given information and the equation for chemical potential of vacancies (μv) in terms of temperature and vacancy concentration (nv).

First, we need to find the change in vacancy concentration (Δnv) when the temperature increases from 27°C to 127°C. Since the vacancy concentration doubles, we have:

Δnv = 2 * nv27°C

Next, we can use the equation for chemical potential of vacancies (μv) in terms of temperature and temperature and vacancy concentration (nv):

μv = μov + kBT ln(nv/N)

At 27°C, the vacancy concentration is not given, but we know that it is not enough to double at 127°C, so we can assume it is a small concentration. In this case, we can use the dilute approximation (μv ≈ μov + μoA), and we know that at equilibrium, μv = 0. Therefore, we have:

μoA = - μov = kBT ln(nv/N)

Now, we can find the change in chemical potential (Δμv) when the temperature increases from 27°C to 127°C:

Δμv = μv127°C - μv27°C = kBT [ln(nv127°C/N) - ln(nv27°C/N)]

Since the vacancy concentration doubles, we have nv127°C = 2 * nv27°C. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

Δμv = kBT [ln(2 * nv27°C/N) - ln(nv27°C/N)] = kBT [ln(2) + ln(nv27°C/N)]

Now, we can find the enthalpy change (ΔH) using the equation:

ΔH = - Δμv = - kBT [ln(2) + ln(nv27°C/N)]

To find the value of nv27°C, we can use the given information given that the vacancy concentration doubles when the temperature increases from 27°C to 127°C. Let's assume that the vacancy concentration at 27°C is x. Then, the vacancy concentration at 127°C is 2x.

Now, we can use the equation for chemical potential of vacancies (μv) in terms of temperature and vacancy concentration (nv) to find the value of x:

μv = μov + kBT ln(x/N)

At equilibrium, μv = 0, so we have:

μo = - kBT ln(x/N)

Now, we can find the value of x by solving for x:

x = N exp(- μo/kT)

Substituting the given value of R, we get:

x = N exp(- μo/(8.314 J/mol K * 273.15 K))

Now, we can find the value of ΔH:

ΔH = - kBT [ln(2) + ln(2x/N)] = - kBT [ln(2) + ln(2) + ln(x/N)] = - kBT [ln(2) + ln(2) + ln(N exp(- μo/(8.314 J/mol K * 273.15 K))/N]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

ΔH = - kBT [ln(2) + ln(2) + ln(N) - μo/(8.314 J/mol K * 273.15 K)]

Now, we can find the value of ΔH by substituting the given value of R and solving for μo:

μo = - kBT ln(x/N) = - (8.314 J/mol K * 273.15 K) ln(x/N)

Now, we can find the value of x:

x = N exp(- μo/(8.314 J/mol K * 273.15 K))

(A) Fine grain size (B) FCC crystal structure (C) High melting point (D) Cold worked microstructure ","The desirable characteristic(s)/attribute(s) for achieving better creep resistance while designing a material for high temperature application are:

(C) High melting point
(B) FCC crystal structure
(A) Coarse grain size (for high-temperature applications where diffusional flow-controlled creep dominates)

Explanation:

1. High melting point: The rate of recovery by climbing of edge dislocations is proportional to the rate of self-diffusion. At a given temperature, since self-diffusion is usually slower for a metal of higher melting point than for a metal of lower melting point, climbing process at a given temperature becomes more difficult in metals and alloys of high melting point, leading to higher resistance to creep.
2. FCC crystal structure: Metals with low stacking fault energy have greater creep resistance because the perfect dislocations are dissociated into partial dislocations, for which it is more difficult to overcome obstacles by cutting through, cross-slipping, or climbing. The lower the stacking fault energy, the higher the separation between partial dislocations, i.e., the width of dissociated dislocations, and the more difficult it is to overcome the obstacles. Such dissociated dislocations exist in FCC metals. Furthermore, FCC metals having close-packed structures than BCC metals result in lower diffusivities that limit creep deformation. So, creep resistance of FCC metals is usually superior to BCC metals at equivalent homologous temperatures.
3. Coarse grain size: For high-temperature applications where diffusional creep dominates, increasing the grain size reduces the creep rate. This is because vacancy diffusion is relatively slow in a coarse-grain material having more number of high-angle grain boundaries, and so, the creep rate is higher. When the same material is subjected to high temperature for grain coarsening, the grain growth causes most of the high-energy grain boundaries to vanish. Hence, the coarse-grain material will result in a lower creep rate and higher resistance to creep. For example, when aluminium is added for deoxidation of steels, it refines the grain size, and thus, creep properties are generally poor in aluminium-deoxidized steels than in silicon-deoxidized steels having relatively coarse grains.",,,0,
Atomic structure,99,G-META-22-50,NUM,38,Consider a tilt boundary of misorientation of 2° in an aluminium grain. The lattice parameter of aluminium is 0.143 nm. The spacing(in nm) between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ,"According to the given context, the number of dislocations per unit length of a tilt boundary can be calculated using the equation (n = 1 / (h * sin(θ/2))), where h is the spacing between dislocations and θ is the tilt angle in radians. In this case, the tilt angle is 2° or 0.0353 radians. The lattice parameter of aluminium is given as 0.143 nm.

First, we need to find the Burgers vector b, which is given by the equation b ~ θ. Since the tilt angle is small, we can assume that the Burgers vector is approximately equal to the lattice parameter.

Therefore, b ~ 0.0353 radians * 0.143 nm/radian = 0.0051 nm.

Next, we can calculate the spacing h using the equation h = 1 / (n * sin(θ/2)). Since we are interested in an estimate only, we can assume that about one fifth of all dislocations contribute to the deformation. Therefore, n ~ 0.2 * (number of dislocations per unit area).

The number of dislocations per unit area can be calculated using the Read-Shockley formula, which gives the energy per unit area of a tilt boundary as Ygb = 4zr(1 - v) x b, where Eo = r v and A = ln(b/ro). For aluminium, the shear modulus is μ = 28 GPa and Poisson's ratio is v = 0.33. The lattice parameter ro is given as 0.143 nm.

Using these values, we can calculate Eo = μ * v = 9.45 GPa * 0.33 = 3.11 GPa and A = ln(b/ro) = ln(0.0051 nm / 0.143 nm) = -2.51.

Therefore, Ygb = 4 * 3.11 GPa * 1 / (2 * 3.11 GPa) * exp(-2.51) = 0.012 J/m².

Since the energy per unit area is given, we can calculate the number of dislocations per unit area as N = Ygb / (Us + Ue), where Us and Ue are the energies per unit length of an edge and screw dislocation, respectively. For aluminium, Us ~ 0.035 J/m and Ue ~ 0.045 J/m.

Therefore, N = 0.012 J/m² / (0.035 J/m + 0.045 J/m) = 0.011 J/m².

Since we assumed that about one fifth of all dislocations contribute to the deformation, the number of dislocations per unit length is n = 0.2 * 0.011 J/m² = 0.0022 J/m².

Finally, we can calculate the spacing h using the equation h = 1 / (n * sin(θ/2)) = 1 / (0.0022 J/m² * sin(0.0353 radians / 2)) = 0.031 nm.

Therefore, the spacing between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary is approximately 0.031 nm or 31 pm.",,,0,

Δσ = k√d

where Δσ is the increase in yield strength, k is the Hall-Petch constant, and d is the grain size.

First, we need to find the Hall-Petch constant for ferritic steel. From the context, we know that the Hall-Petch constant for ferritic steel is 35 N/mm3/2 or 35 MPa√m.

Next, we can calculate the expected yield strength when the grain size is 16 μm:

Δσ = k√d
Δσ = 35 MPa√m × √(16 × 10^-6 m)
Δσ = 35 MPa√(16 × 10^-6)

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What is the relaxation time constant for this material?","To find the relaxation time constant, we can use equation (8.5) given by:

t1/t2 = exp(-Q/(kT1) - Q/(kT2))

We are given the initial temperature T1 = 20°C, the final temperature T2 = 20°C (since the temperature is constant during the experiment), and the initial stress σ1 = 10 MPa, the final stress σ2 = 5 MPa, and the initial strain ε1 = 50%.

First, we need to find the strain rate ˙ε at 20°C using equation (8.3):

˙ε = Aexp(-Q/(kT))

Since the strain is constant, the strain rate is also constant. We can use the given strain of 50% to find the strain rate:

50% = ε1 = ˙ε0t1

Solving for ˙ε0, we get:

˙ε0 = 50% / t1

Now, we can use equation (8.5) to find the relaxation time constant:

t1/t2 = exp(-Q/(kT1) - Q/(kT2))

Since T1 = T2, we have:

t1/t2 = exp(-2Q/(kT))

We know that σ1 = 10 MPa and σ2 = 5 MPa, so we can find the ratio of stresses:

σ1/σ2 = 10 MPa / 5 MPa = 2

Using the given strain of 50%, we can find the initial strain rate ˙ε0:

˙ε0 = 50% / t1

Now we can find the activation energy Q using the given stresses and time:

ln(σ1/σ2) = ln(2) = Q/(kT)

Solving for Q, we get:

Q = kT * ln(2)

Now we can find the relaxation time constant:

t1/t2 = exp(-2Q/(kT))

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

t1/t2 = exp(-2 * (kT * ln(2)) / kT)

Simplifying, we get:

t1/t2 = exp(-2 * ln(2)) = exp(-ln(2)^2) = 1/e^2

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

ln(t1/t2) = ln(1/e^2) = -ln(e) - ln(e) = -2ln(e)

τr = η/E

Since the elastic modulus is temperature-dependent, we need to find its value at 20°C. Let's assume that the elastic modulus of the elastomer at 20°C is 1 MPa.

τr = η/E = η/(1 MPa)

Next, we need to find the stress relaxation constant (A) using the initial stress (10 MPa) and the strain (0.5) and the elastic modulus (1 MPa).

A = σ0/ε0 = 10 MPa /0.5 = 20 MPa

Now, we can use the stress relaxation equation (7.2) to find the stress after 60 days at 20°C.

σ(t) = σ0 * exp(-t/τr)

σ(60 days) = σ0 * exp(-60 days / τr)

To find the exact value, we need to know the value of the viscosity (η). Unfortunately, the given information does not provide that value. Therefore, we cannot find the exact stress after 60 days at 20°C.

However, we can make an approximation by assuming a value for the viscosity and calculating the stress accordingly. For example, if we assume a viscosity of 1 Pa.s, we can calculate the stress after 60 days at 20°C as:

First, let's calculate the work done to deform the material to failure. Since the alloy does not exhibit any strain hardening, we can assume that the deformation is elastic until failure. The total strain at failure is given as ε = 0.108.

The strain energy density (W) for elastic deformation can be calculated using the given Young's modulus (E) and the total strain (ε):

W = 0.5 * E * ε^2

Substituting the given values:

W = 0.5 * 110 GPa * (0.108)^2

F = σy * A

The volume (V) of the bar can be calculated using its length (L) and cross-sectional area (A):

V = AL

The mass (m) of the bar can be calculated using its density (ρ) and volume (V):

m = ρ * V

The potential energy (U) at failure can be calculated using the load (F) and the length (L) of the bar:

U = F * L

Substituting the given values:

U = 880 MPa * A * L

To convert the units to MJ/$m^3$, we need to convert the potential energy (U) to Joules and then divide by the volume (V) in cubic meters.

1 MJ = 10^6 J
1 m^3 = 10^6 mm^3

Substituting the given values:

U = 880 MPa * A * L * 10^6 J / (10^6 mm^3)

We know that V = (π/4) (d/2) ^2 and d = 30 μm + 2 × 90 μm = 210 μm. So,

V = π (210 μm) ^2 / 4 = 3.1416 × 10^-9 m^3

V0 = π (30 μm) ^2 / 4 = 7.854 × 10^-11 m^3

m = -ln(1 - (3.1416 × 10^-9 / 7.854 × 10^-11) ^ (1/m)) / ln(300 / 300)

Solving this equation numerically, we get m ≈ 13.1.

If the applied load is 10 kg and the average length of diagonals of square indentation is 0.5 mm, the Vickers hardness in kg $mm^(−2)$ is? (round off to nearest integer)","To calculate the Vickers hardness, we can use the formula:

Vickers hardness = (Applied load / Area of indentation) × 10^3

First, we need to calculate the area of the indentation. The area of each lateral triangular face of the pyramidal indentation is 1/4th of the lateral area, and the lateral area is given by the formula:

Lateral area = (a × LS) / 2

where a is the length of each arm of the square base of the pyramidal indentation, and LS is the slant height of the pyramidal indentation.

From the given information, we have:

a = 0.5 mm
LS = hc cos(136° / 2)

where hc is the contact depth of indentation beneath the specimen surface under load.

To find hc, we can use the formula:

hc = tan(68° / 2) × a

Now we can calculate the lateral area:

Lateral area = (0.5 × hc cos(136° / 2)) / 2

Next, we can calculate the total area of the indentation by multiplying the lateral area by 4:

Total area = 4 × (0.5 × hc cos(136° / 2)) / 2

Now we can calculate the Vickers hardness:

Vickers hardness = (10 × 10^3) / (4 × (0.5 × hc cos(136° / 2)) / 2)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Vickers hardness = 201.06 × hc cos(136° / 2)

To find the value of hc, we can use the given information that the contact depth is beneath the specimen surface under a load of 10 kg. However, we don't have enough information to calculate the exact value of hc. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact value of the Vickers hardness with the given information.

However, we can make an approximation by assuming that the same indentation depth is obtained when the sample is indented with a Knoop indenter. In that case, the indentation depth of a Knoop indenter with a load of 10 kg is approximately 0.01 mm. Using this value, we can calculate an approximate value for the Vickers hardness:

Vickers hardness ≈ 201.06 × 0.01 × cos(136° / 2) ≈ 19.6 kg/mm^2

Therefore, the answer is approximately 19.6 (rounded to the nearest integer).",,,0,

Explanation:

In the given problem, we are dealing with a polymer matrix composite reinforced with long continuous ceramic fibres aligned in one direction. The Young's moduli of the matrix and fibres are denoted by $E_m$ and $E_f$ respectively, and the volume fraction of the fibres is denoted by $f$.

We are asked to find the Young's modulus of the composite $E_C$ in a direction perpendicular to the length of fibres, assuming an isostress condition.

To find the expression for $E_C$, we can use the rule of mixtures, which states that the strain is additive under the assumption of isostress. Therefore, the strain in the composite is given by:

$$\epsilon = \epsilon_m + \epsilon_f$$

Since the strain is defined as the partial derivative of the spatial displacement function with respect to the spatial coordinates, we have:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial u_m}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_f}{\partial x}$$

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial u_m}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_f}{\partial y}$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \frac{\partial^2 u_m}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_m}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_f}{\partial y^2}$$

Under the assumption of isostress, the stresses in the matrix and fibres are equal, i.e., $\sigma_m = \sigma_f$. Therefore, we can write:

$$\frac{1}{E_C} = \frac{1}{E_m} \frac{V_m}{A_A} + \frac{1}{E_f} \frac{V_f}{A_A}$$

where $V_m$ and $V_f$ are the volumes of the matrix and fibres, and $A_A$ is the cross-sectional area of the composite.

Since the volume fractions of the matrix and fibres are related to their volumes and cross-sectional area by:

$$V_m = (1-f)V$$

$$V_f = fV$$

where $V$ is the total volume of the composite, we have:

$$\frac{1}{E_C} = \frac{1}{E_m} \frac{(1-f)V}{A_A} + \frac{1}{E_f} \frac{fV}{A_A}$$

$$\frac{1}{E_C} = \frac{1}{E_m} \frac{(1-f)}{A_A} A_A + \frac{1}{E_f} \frac{f}{A_A} A_A$$

$$\frac{1}{E_C}{} = \frac{1}{E_m} \frac{1}{A_A} A_A + \frac{1}{E_f} \frac{1}{A_A} A_A$$

$$\frac{1}{E_C} = \frac{1}{E_m} \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{E_f} \frac{1}{1}$$

$$\frac{1}{E_C} = \frac{1}{E_m} + \frac{1}{E_f}$$

Therefore, we have:

$$E_C = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{E_m} + \frac{1}{E_f}}$$

$$E_C = \frac{E_m E_f}{E_m + E_f}$$

$$E_C = fE_m + (1-f)E_f$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $E_C$ = f$E_m$ + (1-f)$E_f$.",,,0,

Explanation:

Fatigue (P) is a phenomenon that occurs due to the cyclic application of stress, leading to the progressive damage and eventual failure of a material. The possible mechanism for fatigue is the interaction between dislocations (R-3).

Creep (Q) is a time-dependent deformation process that occurs under constant stress. The possible mechanisms for creep are grain boundary sliding (1), slip band extrusion and intrusion (2), and dislocation interaction (4). However, since creep is a time-dependent process, it is not directly related to the yield point phenomenon (S), which is a static property.

Strain hardening (R) is a phenomenon that occurs when a material undergoes plastic deformation, resulting in an increase in its strength. The possible mechanism for strain hardening is dislocation interaction (4).

Yield point phenomenon (S) is a phenomenon where a material exhibits a decrease in its flow stress at a specific temperature and strain rate, leading to a yielding point before the material starts to flow plastically.

Mechanical,24,G-META-12-44,MCQS-NUM,42,Fracture stress for a brittle material having a crack length of 1 µm is 200 MPa. Fracture stress for the same material having a crack length of 4 µm is  (A) 200 MPa (B) 150 MPa (C) 100 MPa (D) 50 MPa," The fracture stress for a brittle material is inversely proportional to the square root of the crack size. Therefore, the fracture stress for a crack length of 4 µm is lower than that for a crack length of 1 µm.

Using the given equation for fracture stress (rf = √(2Ecs/a)), we can calculate the fracture stress for a crack length of 4 µm:

rf (4 µm) = √(2Ecs/4 µm)

Given that the fracture stress for a crack length of 1 µm is 200 MPa, we can find the value of Ecs:

Ecs = (200 MPa)^2 * (1 µm)^2
Ecs = 8.0 × 10^11 Pa m^2

Now, we can calculate the fracture stress for a crack length of 4 µm:

rf (4 µm) = √(2 * 8.0 × 10^11 Pa m^2 / 4 µm)
rf (4 µm) = √(2 * 2.0 × 10^12 Pa m^-1)
rf (4 µm) = √(4.0 × 10^12 Pa m^-1)
rf (4 µm) = 2 * 1.9 × 10^6 MPa

Yield strength of the material is approximately  (A) 100 MPa (B) 115 MPa (C) 165 MPa (D) 215 MPa," To find the yield strength of the material, we can use the Hall-Petch equation:

or0 = yield strength
oi = friction stress
k = Hall-Petch constant
d = grain size

Given:
oi = 100 MN/$m^2$
k = 0.10 MN/$m^{(1.5)}$
d = ASTM No. 6 corresponds to a grain size of approximately 1.67 µm

First, we need to convert the grain size to meters:

d = 1.67 µm = 1.67 × 10^-6 m

Now, we can calculate the yield strength:

or0 = oi + kd^(-1/2)
or0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.10 MN/$m^{(1.5)}$ × (1.67 × 10^-6 m)^(-1/2)
or0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.10 MN/$m^{(1.5)}$ × 0.0113
or0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ + 0.0121 MN/$m^2$
or0 = 100.0121 MN/$m^2$
or0 = 100.0121 GPa

To find the yield strength for a grain size of 36 µm, we can interpolate between the given values.

First, let's find the percentage increase in yield strength:

Percentage increase = (New yield strength - Old yield strength) / Old yield strength × 100%
Percentage increase = (145 MPa - 100 MPa) / 100 MPa × 100% = 45%

Now, let's find the yield strength for a grain size of 36 µm based on the given percentage increase:

New yield strength = Old yield strength + (Old yield strength × Percentage increase / 100%)

The percentage increase is 45%, so the yield strength for a grain size of 36 µm should be between the yield strengths for grain sizes of 25 µm and 64 µm. Since the yield strength increases as the grain size decreases, the answer should be closer to 125 MPa (for a grain size of 25 µm) than to 140 MPa (for a grain size of 64 µm).

The initial gauge length of the specimen (in mm) was?," To find the initial gauge length of the specimen, we can use the given information about the constant crosshead speed and the initial strain rate. From the text, we know that the strain rate is related to the crosshead velocity and the initial gauge length through the equations (1.144a) and (1.144b). We can use these equations to solve for the initial gauge length.

First, let's find the initial engineering strain rate using the given information:

_eC = 5 * $10^(-3) s^(-1)

Next, we can use equation (1.144a) to find the initial engineering strain:

_eC = deC/dt = vC/L0C

We know that the crosshead speed is 6 mm/min, so the crosshead velocity is 6 * $10^3 mm/s. We can substitute this value and the initial engineering strain rate into the equation:

5 * $10^(-3) s^(-1) = 6 * $10^3 mm/s / L0C

Solving for L0C, we get:

L0C = 6 * $10^3 mm/s / (5 * $10^(-3) s^(-1)) = 1.2 * $10^6 mm

Since the initial gauge length is given in mm, we need to convert L0C to L0:

L0 = L0C / (1 + eC) = 1.2 * $10^6 mm / (1 + 5 * $10^(-3) s^(-1)) = 1.198 * $10^6 mm = 11980 mm

First, let's find the initial gauge length (L0) by using the given change in gauge length (ΔL) and the true strain (ϕ):

ϕ = ln(L/L0)
0.405 = ln(L/L0)

Taking the exponent of both sides:

L/L0 = e^(0.405)

ΔL = L - L0

Substituting the expression for L/L0 from above:

ΔL = (L * e^(0.405)) - L0

We don't have a value for L0, but we do know that ΔL is 5 mm. So, we can set up the equation:

Therefore, $\alpha$ is the constant of proportionality that relates the driving forces for sintering at different particle sizes.

Mechanical,41,G-META-15-55,NUM,66,A brittle material is mechanically tested in medium P in which it has surface energy $𝛾_𝑠$= 0.9 J $m^(-2)$ . This material has a fracture strength of 300 MPa for a given flaw size. The same solid containing the same flaws is then tested in medium Q in which $𝛾_𝑠$= 0.1 J $m^(-2)$. The fracture strength (in MPa) in medium Q based on Griffith's theory is?,"To find the fracture strength in medium Q based on Griffith's theory, we need to use the Griffith equation (8.23) and the given data:

Given:
- Fracture strength in medium P: 300 MPa
- Surface energy in medium P: $𝛾_𝑠$= 0.9 J $m^(-2)$
- Surface energy in medium Q: $𝛾_𝑠$= 0.1 J $m^(-2)$

Griffith equation:
$T_c = \sqrt{\frac{2\gamma}{a}}$

where:
- $T_c$ is the critical stress intensity factor (fracture strength)
- $\gamma$ is$ is the surface energy
- $a$ is the crack length

First, we need to find the critical crack size $a$ in medium P and medium Q using the given fracture strength and the surface energies:

Medium P:
$T_c = 300 \text{ MPa} = 300 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}$

Using the Griffith equation:
$a = \frac{T_c^2}{2\gamma} = \frac{(300 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa})^2}{2 \times 0.9 \text{ J} \times m^2}$

Calculate the value of $a$ and then find the corresponding crack length in medium Q using the given surface energy:

$a_{Medium\ Q} = \frac{T_c^2}{2\gamma_{Medium\ Q}} = \frac{(300 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa})^2}{2 \times 0.1 \text{ J} \times m^2}$

Now, we have the critical crack size in both media. We can compare the results to find the fracture strength in medium Q.

Since the Griffith equation relates the critical stress intensity factor to the surface energy and crack size, we can find the fracture strength in medium Q by using the critical crack size we calculated and the surface energy in medium Q:

$T_c = \sqrt{\frac{2\gamma_{Medium\ Q}}{a_{Medium\ Q}}}$

$T_c = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 0.1 \text{ J} \times m^2}{(a_{Medium\ Q})}}$

$T_c = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 0.1 \text{ J} \times m^2}{\frac{(300 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa})^2}{2 \times 0.9 \text{ J} \times m^2}}}$

$T_c = \sqrt{\frac{0.1 \text{ J} \times m^2 \times 0.9 \text{ J} \times m^2}{(300 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa})^2}}$

$T_c = \frac{0.9 \text{ J} \times m^2}{300 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa} \times \sqrt{2}}$

$T_c \approx 1.15 \times 10^3 \text{ Pa}$

To convert the critical stress intensity factor to fracture strength, we need to use the elastic modulus of the material:

$E = 100 \text{ GPa} = 100 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}$

$T_f = \frac{T_c}{E} = \frac{1.15 \times 10^3 \text{ Pa}}{100 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}} \approx 1.15 \times 10^{-6} \text{ MPa}$

$T_f \approx 1.15 \text{ MPa}$

where Vf is the volume fraction of the fiber, Eft is the elastic modulus of the fiber, Em is the elastic modulus of the matrix, and Ect is the elastic modulus of the composite in the transverse direction.

Substituting the given values, we have:

Vf = 0.4
Eft = 70 GPa
Em = 3.5 GPa

Solving for Ect:

(1/Ect) = (0.4/70 GPa) + (0.6/3.5 GPa)

Ect = 1/(1/0.4*(70 GPa) + 1/0.6*(3.5 GPa))

Ect = 1/(0.0529 + 0.1667)

Ect = 1/0.2196

Ect = 4.61 GPa

Therefore, the elastic modulus along the transverse direction is approximately 4.61 GPa.

Since the rod is subjected to a uniaxial stress, σy and σz are zero, and εx = σx/E = 0.02. Substituting these values into the equation for εv, we get:

εv = 1 - 2(0.3) * (1) * (0.02 + 0 + 0) = 1 - 0.6 * 0.02 = 0.94

To find the volumetric strain to three decimal places, we can write it as:

Mechanical,47,G-META-17-52,NUM,41,Given the young's modulus E = 4.5 GPa. A perfectly elastic-plastic material has a yield of 450 MPa and fractures at a strain of 0.45. The ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is? (answer up to three decimal places),"To find the ratio of resilience to toughness, we first need to calculate the resilience and toughness separately.

Resilience:
The resilience is the energy absorbed during elastic deformation, which is given by the area under the linear portion of the stress-strain diagram up to the yield point. Since the material is elastic-plastic, the linear portion of the stress-strain diagram corresponds to the elastic behavior up to the yield point.

From the given information, we have the following:
Young's modulus E = 4.5 GPa
Yield strain εy = 0.45

The strain energy per unit volume U is given by the area under the stress-strain curve up to the yield point. Since the material is elastic up to the yield point, we can use the equation for the strain energy of a perfectly elastic material:

U = 1/2 * E * εy^2

Substituting the given values:

U = 1/2 * 4.5 GPa * (0.45)^2 = 0.4875 GPa * (0.45)^2 = 0.1133 GPa * m^3/C03

Resilience = U * volume = 0.1133 GPa * m^3/C03 * volume


Toughness:
The toughness is the total energy absorbed by the material up to the point of fracture. Since the material is elastic-plastic, the total energy absorbed is the sum of the energy absorbed during elastic deformation (resilience) and the energy absorbed during plastic deformation (toughness in the plastic range).

The energy absorbed during plastic deformation is given by the area under the stress-strain curve up to the fracture strain. Since the stress-strain curve is linear up to the yield point and then follows a parabolic trend beyond the yield point, we can use the following equation to calculate the energy absorbed during plastic deformation:

U_plastic = 1/3 * (σf^2 * εf)

where σf is the fracture stress and εf is the fracture strain.

From the given information, we have:
Yield stress σy = 450 MPa = 0.45 GPa
Fracture strain εf = 0.45

Substituting the given values:

U_plastic = 1/3 * (0.45 GPa^2 * 0.45) = 0.1171 GPa * m^3/C03

Toughness = U_elastic + U_plastic = 0.1133 GPa * m^3/C03 + 0.1171 GPa * m^3/C03 = 0.2304 GPa * m^3/C03

Now, we can find the ratio of resilience to toughness:

Ratio of resilience to toughness = Resilience / Toughness = (0.1133 GPa * m^3/C03 * volume) / (0.2304 GPa * m^3/C03)

To get the answer up to three decimal places, we need to know the value of the volume. Without that information, we cannot provide an exact answer. However, we can express the answer in terms of the volume:

Ratio of resilience to toughness = (0.1133 / 0.2304) * (volume / m^3)

So, the answer depends on the volume of the material.",,,0,

(A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture (B) The fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture (D) The fibre will undergo buckling","Based on the information provided above, the correct answer is (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture.

Explanation:

The given stress of 20 MPa is less than the theoretical fracture strength of the glass fibre, which can be estimated using the Griffith equation for brittle materials. The Griffith equation relates the critical stress, ac (i.e., the fracture strength), required to propagate a crack of length 2a through a solid of elastic modulus, E, and surface energy, Ysv, as follows:

ac = (Ysv / (2a))(1 - (v^2))(E / (1 - v^2))

where v is the Poisson's ratio.

Given that the fibre diameter is 5 microns or 5 x 10^-6 meters, the crack length, 2a, would be much smaller than this value. Therefore, the critical stress, ac, would be much larger than the given stress of 20 MPa.

Since the given stress is less than the critical stress, the fibre will not undergo fracture. Instead, it will undergo elastic deformation, as the stress is below the elastic limit of the material.

Therefore, the answer is (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture.",,,0,

If the composite is subjected to longitudinal loading (iso-strain condition and assuming elastic response), what is the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement rounded off to two decimal places?","To find the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement, we can use the rule of mixtures for Young's modulus in the longitudinal direction:

$𝐸_{cl} = 𝐸_{cf}V_{f} + 𝐸_{cm}V_{m}$

where $𝐸_{cl}$ is the Young's modulus of the composite, $𝐸_{cf}$ is the Young's modulus of the fiber, $𝐸_{cm}$ is the Young's modulus of the matrix, $Vf$ is the volume fraction of fibers, and $Vm$ is the volume fraction of the matrix.

Given that $Vf = 0.25$ and $Vm = 1 - Vf = 0.75$, we can rearrange the equation to find the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement:

$𝜏_{f} = \frac{𝐸_{cf}V_{f}}{𝐸_{cl}}$

Substituting the given values, we have:

$𝜏_{f} = \frac{250\text{ GPa} \times 0.25}{𝐸_{cl}}$

To find $𝐸_{cl}$, we can use the same rule of mixtures equation with the given values of $𝐸_{cf}$ and $𝐸_{cm}$:

$𝐸_{cl} = 250\text{ GPa} \times 0.25 + 2.5\text{ GPa} \times 0.75 = 62.5\text{ GPa}$

Substituting this value back into the equation for $𝜏_{f}$, we get:

$𝜏_{f} = \frac{250\text{ GPa} \times 0.25}{62.5\text{ GPa}} \approx 0.402$

Therefore, the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement is approximately 0.40 or 40.2%.",,,0,

The fracture strength depends on various factors such as the material properties, crack length, and loading conditions. Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to determine the answer with certainty.

However, based on the given information, we can make some assumptions. If we assume that the fracture strength is directly proportional to the inverse of the crack length, then we can estimate that the fracture strength of the sample with the smaller crack ($𝜎_1$) is greater than that of the sample with the larger crack ($𝜎_2$). Therefore, the ratio of the fracture strengths would be less than 1, which means the answer is (A) 0.5 or some value less than 0.5.

Let's denote the mass of the rod as m, the distance between the bottom of the rod and the wall as h, and the coefficient of friction between the rod and the wall as μ.

When the bottom of the rod is pulled horizontally away from the wall, the potential energy of the rod is converted into kinetic energy of the bottom end. The kinetic energy is then transferred to the top end of the rod as it starts sliding down the wall.

The conservation of energy equation is:

mgh = (1/2)mv²

where g is the acceleration due to gravity.

We can find the velocity of the bottom end of the rod using the given acceleration and the distance it moves:

a = 4 𝑐𝑚. $𝑠^(−1)$
d = h

v = √(2ad) = √(2ah)

Substituting the values, we get:

v = √(2 × 4 × 0.3) = 1.155 𝑐𝑚. $𝑠^(−1)$

Now, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum to find the velocity of the top end of the rod. Let's denote the velocity of the top end of the rod as v\_top.

The momentum of the system before the rod starts sliding is zero, as there is no motion in the horizontal direction. The momentum after the rod starts sliding is given by the momentum of the bottom end of the rod and the momentum of the top end of the rod in the vertical direction.

The momentum of the bottom end of the rod is mv, and the momentum of the top end of the rod in the vertical direction is mv\_top. Since the rod is long and thin, we can assume that the mass of the top part of the rod is negligible compared to the mass of the bottom part, so the momentum of the top end of the rod in the horizontal direction is zero.

The principle of conservation of momentum in the vertical direction is:

mv = mv\_top

Substituting the value of v from above, we get:

v\_top = v / (1 + μ)

Using the value of v from above, we get:

v\_top = 1.155 / (1 + μ)

To find the value of μ, we can use the equation of friction:

F\_f = μmg

where F\_f is the friction force acting on the bottom end of the rod. The friction force is equal to the normal force, which is given by the weight of the rod:

F\_f = mg

Substituting the value of g and the mass of the rod, we get:

F\_f = 9.81 × 0.5 = 4.905 N

The coefficient of friction is given by:

μ = F\_f / mg = 4.905 / (0.5 × 9.81) = 0.5

Substituting this value of μ in the equation for v\_top, we get:

v\_top = 1.155 / (1 + 0.5) = 0.703 𝑐𝑚. $𝑠^(−1)$

Therefore, the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod when it starts sliding down the wall is approximately 0.70 𝑐𝑚. $𝑠^(−1)$ .",,,0,

Resilience is a measure of the ability of a material to absorb energy elastically during deformation and release it upon unloading. It is the area under the elastic portion of the true stress-strain curve. In contrast, the engineering stress-strain curve does not represent the true behavior of the material in the plastic range, and the area under the elastic region of the engineering stress-strain curve does not provide an accurate measure of the resilience of the material.",,,0,

If the applied tensile stress is 100 MPa and the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) is 25 MPa, which one of the following slip systems will be activated?  (A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1) (B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1) (C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1) (D) [0 1 1](1 1 -1)","Based on the given information, the slip system that will be activated is the one with the largest Schmid factor. The Schmid factor is given by the equation: Schmid factor = cosθ cosλ, where θ is the angle between the normal to the slip plane and the tensile axis, and λ is the angle between the slip direction and the tensile axis.

To determine which slip system has the largest Schmid factor, we need to calculate the Schmid factors for each of the given slip systems:

(A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1)
θ = arccos((-1)/√3) = 120°
λ = 0° (since the slip direction is in the [1 1 1] direction)
Schmid factor = cos(120°) cos(0°) = -1/2

(B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1)
θ = arccos(1/√3) = 60°
λ = 90° (since the slip direction is perpendicular to the tensile axis)
Schmid factor = cos(60°) cos(90°) = 0

(C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1)
θ = arccos(-1/√3) = 240°
λ = 180° (since the slip direction is opposite to the tensile axis)
Schmid factor = cos(240°) cos(180°) = -1

(D) [0 1 1](1 1 -1)
θ = arccos(-1/√3) = 240°
λ = 0°
Schmid factor = cos(240°) cos(0°) = -1/2

Since the Schmid factor for option (C) is the same as that for option (A), but the slip direction for option (C) is different, we need to consider the Taylor factor. The Taylor factor is a factor that accounts for the effect of the applied stress on the slip system. It is given by the equation: Taylor factor = (σcosλ)/(CRSScosθ), where σ is the applied tensile stress.

For option (A), the Taylor factor is:
Taylor factor = (100 MPa cos(0°))/(25 MPa cos(120°)) = 2.41

For option (C), the Taylor factor is:
Taylor factor = (100 MPa cos(180°))/(25 MPa cos(240°)) = -0.41

Since the Taylor factor for option (C) is negative, it means that the applied stress is in the opposite direction to the slip direction, and therefore, this slip system will not be activated.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (A): [-1 0 1](1 1 1).",,,0,

Explanation:

Necking instability occurs during tensile testing when the slope of the true stress-true strain curve equals the true strain. This is because at the onset of necking, the material can no longer support the applied load due to the reduction in cross-sectional area, and the increase in stress required to cause further deformation is not sufficient to offset the decrease in load-carrying capacity. Therefore, the condition for necking instability is given by dσ/de = σ, which can be rearranged to dσ/de = 1/ε, or dσ/dε = ε.

μ\_Al = 1*10^(–3) Pa.s
Reynolds number = 5*10^(5)
f = 0.2

Reynolds number = ρ\_Al v d μ\_Al
5*10^(5) = 2360 kg/m³ v (3 m) 1*10^(–3) Pa.s
v = 1.82 m/s

Now, we can calculate the force:

F = 0.2 π (0.03 m)² (2360 kg/m³ (1.82 m/s)² / 2)
F = 0.2 π (0.0009 m²) (2360 kg/m³ (3.28 m²/s²) / 2)
F = 0.2 π (0.0009 m²) (2360 kg/m³) (1.64 m/s²)
F = 0.2 π (0.0009 m²) (5475.2 kg/m³) 1.64 m/s²
F = 0.2 π (0.0009 m²) (8996.4 N)
F = 0.2 π (0.00287 m³) 8996.4 N

First, let's find the derivative of σ with respect to ε:

dσ/dε = 1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{0.25-1}$ = 1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{-0.25}$

Now, we set this derivative equal to zero to find the value of ε at the maximum stress point:

1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{-0.25}$ = 0

To solve for ε, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1050 * 0.25) + ln($ε^{-0.25}$) = ln(0)

ln(1050 * 0.25) = -ln($ε^{-0.25}$)

Using the property of logarithms, we can write:

ln(1050 * 0.25) = ln(1050) + ln(0.25) - ln($ε^{-0.25}$)

Now, we can use the fact that ln(1050) ≈ 6.907 and ln(0.25) ≈ -1.609 to approximate the logarithms:

6.907 - 1.609 - ln($ε^{-0.25}$) ≈ 0

Using the property of logarithms again, we can write:

ln($\frac{1}{ε^{0.25}}$) ≈ -6.398

Taking the exponent of both sides, we get:

$ε^{0.25}$ ≈ $\frac{1}{e^{-6.398}}$ ≈ 22.15

Now, we can find the maximum true uniform strain by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of the gage length at the maximum load to the original gage length:

eu = ln(L/L0)

Since L = εuC0L0, we have:

eu = ln(εuC0)

Substituting εu = 22.15, we get:

eu = ln(22.15C0)

coefficient of friction (l) = 0.5

First, we need to find the final thickness (h2) using the given formula for maximum reduction:

h2 = h1 / (C0h2)

where C0 is a constant that depends on the roll radius and the angle of friction:

C0 = 4 / (sin²(f / 2))

Using the given roll diameter and coefficient of friction, we can calculate the angle of friction (f):

C0 = 4 / (sin²(30° / 2)) = 4 / (sin²(15°)) = 4 / (0.2588) = 15.48

Now, we can find h2:

h2 = h1 / (C0h2) = 480 mm / (15.48 × 720 mm²) = 480 mm / 11312.8 mm² = 0.0423 mm

The assertion (a) that the peak aging time for an Al-4 wt.% Cu alloy is indicated by a maximum in the hardness is true. This is because during the aging process, the formation of precipitates such as θ, which are coherent with the matrix, leads to an increase in hardness. The maximum hardness is achieved when the maximum volume fraction of these precipitates is formed.

First, let's find the true stress (σ) corresponding to the given true strain (ε = 0.3).

From the flow curve, we have σ = $200𝜀^{0.25}$. We need to find σ when ε = 0.3.

We can rewrite the flow curve as 𝜀 = ($200$)^(1/0.25) * σ^(0.25).

Now, we can solve for σ when ε = 0.3:

0.3 = ($200$)^(1/0.25) * σ^(0.25)

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides:

log10(0.3) = log10($200$^(1/0.25)) + log10(σ^(0.25))

Using a calculator, we find that log10($200$^(1/0.25)) ≈ 1.115.

Subtracting this value from the logarithm of 0.3, we get:

log10(σ^(0.25)) ≈ log10(0.3) - log10($200$^(1/0.25)) ≈ -0.185

Now, we can find σ by raising 10 to the power of this logarithm:

σ ≈ 10^(-0.185) * $20.3$^(1/0.25) ≈ 111.1 MPa

Next, we can calculate the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume by integrating the true stress and true strain relationship:

W = ∫σdε = ∫$111.1$MPa * $0.3$dε

The integral of this function can be calculated as:

W = $111.1$MPa * $0.3$ * ε = $33.33$MPa*m

To convert this value to MJ/$m^3$, we need to divide by 1,000,000:

W = $33.33$MPa*m / 1,000,000 = $33.33$×10^-6 MJ/$m^3$

So, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is approximately $33.33$×10^-6 MJ/$m^3$.",,,0,

First, we need to calculate the value of r0 using the given Young's modulus (E) and surface energy (cs).

From equation (9.9), we have:

rc = sqrt(Ecsr0)

We are given E = 60 GPa and cs = 0.5 J.m^(-2). To convert the surface energy to SI units, we have:

cs = 0.5 J.m^(-2) = 0.5 N.m^(-1)

Now, we can calculate r0:

rc = sqrt(Ecsr0)
rc = sqrt((60 GPa)(0.5 N.m^(-1)))
rc = 1.154 x 10^(-8) m

Since qt = r0, we can now use equation (9.27) to find the fracture strength (rf):

rf = sqrt(2Ecs/r0)
rf = sqrt(2(60 GPa)(0.5 N.m^(-1))/(1.154 x 10^(-8) m))
rf = 1.17 GPa

Therefore, the fracture strength of the brittle material with a surface crack of length 2µm is approximately 1.17 MPa.",,,0,
Mechanical,79,G-META-17-22,NUM,36,"A material which shows power law behavior,  σ = 50*$ε^(0.3)$, is being wire drawn. The maxium strain per pass in annealed condition (assume ideal work and efficiency η = 1) is?(answer up to two decimal places)"," To find the maximum strain per pass in annealed condition for the given power law material, we can use the power law equation, σ = 50*$ε^(0.3)$. We need to find the value of ε that corresponds to the maximum ideal reduction per pass.

First, let's find the maximum reduction per pass, rmax, in annealed condition without considering friction or back tension. We can use the equation for the ideal drawing stress, rF = Yln(A1/A2), where A1 and A2 are the initial and final cross-sectional areas, respectively. Since the width remains constant, we have A1 = w*h1 and A2 = w*h2.

rmax = ln(h1/h2)

Now, we need to find the corresponding maximum strain, εmax. We can use the power law equation, σ = 50*$ε^(0.3)$, and the ideal drawing stress equation, rF = Yln(A1/A2), to solve for εmax.

First, let's find Y, the plane strain flow stress, in terms of rmax. We have rF = Yln(h1/h2) = rmax. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get Y = rmax/ln(h1/h2).

Now, we can substitute Y in the power law equation, σ = 50*$ε^(0.3)$, and solve for εmax.

50 = σ = 50*$ε^(0.3)$

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides and solving for ε, we get:

ε = ($(50/50)^(1/0.3)) = 1.189

Now, we can find εmax by using the relationship between the true strain, ε, and the reduction, r. We have ε = ln(1 + r). Substituting r = rmax, we get:

εmax = ln(1 + rmax)

Substituting rmax = ln(h1/h2), we get:

εmax = ln(h1/h2 + 1)

Now, we can find the value of εmax up to two decimal places by substituting the given values of h1 and h2.

Assuming h1 = 10 mm and h2 = 7 mm, we have:

εmax = ln(h1/h2 + 1) = ln(1.4) = 0.346

So, the maximum strain per pass in annealed condition is approximately 0.35 (rounded to two decimal places).",,,0,

The length of the crack (in m) after one million cycles will be?(answer up to three decimal places).","To find the length of the crack after one million cycles, we need to integrate the crack growth rate equation over that number of cycles.

First, let's find the value of ΔK for the given stress amplitudes:

ΔK = σ(maximum) - σ(minimum) = 200 Mpa - 0 Mpa = 200 Mpa

Now, we can use the given crack growth rate equation to find the crack length after one million cycles:

a(1,000,000 cycles) = a(initial) + ∫da/dN dN

Using the given crack growth rate equation, we have:

da/dN = $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$

We want to find the area under this curve from a = 1 m to a = a(1,000,000 cycles). To do this, we can set up an integral:

∫[1, a(1,000,000 cycles)] $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3 da

Substituting the value of ΔK and integrating, we get:

∫[1, a(1,000,000 cycles)] $10^(-12)$ (200 Mpa)^3 da

= $10^(-12)$ (200 Mpa)^4 [ln(a(1,000,000 cycles) - 1) - ln(1)]

To find a(1,000,000 cycles), we need to solve for the value that makes the argument of the natural logarithm equal to zero:

ln(a(1,000,000 cycles) - 1) - ln(1) = 0

ln(a(1,000,000 cycles) - 1) = ln(1)

a(1,000,000 cycles) - 1 = e

a(1,000,000 cycles) = e + 1

Now, we can find the length of the crack after one million cycles by adding the initial crack length to the length we just found:

a(1,000,000 cycles) = e + 1 + 1 = e + 2 ≈ 2.71828 + 2 = 4.71828 meters

In this case, the roll diameter is given as 200 mm, the coefficient of friction is 0.1, and we need to find the maximum reduction in a single pass.

First, we need to find the friction angle f. We know that f = tan⁻¹(μ), so:

f = tan⁻¹(0.1) ≈ 5.71°

Next, we can find the roll radius R by dividing the roll diameter by 2:

R = 200 mm / 2 = 100 mm


Now, we can find the maximum possible reduction in a single pass using the equation (12.17a):

Dhmax = 4Rsin²f/C

We don't have a value for the constant C in this problem, but we can still find the maximum reduction as a ratio of the initial thickness h:

Dhmax = 4Rsin²f/C ≈ 4 × 100 mm × sin²(5.71°)/C

To find the maximum reduction in mm to one decimal place, we need to know the value of the constant C. Without that information, we cannot provide an exact answer. However, we can express the maximum reduction as a ratio of the initial thickness:

Δh/h = Dhmax/h ≈ 4 × sin²(5.71°)

Using a calculator, we find that sin²(5.71°) ≈ 0.111, so:

Δh/h ≈ 0.444

What is the value of the resolved shear stress on the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system in MPa rounded off to two decimal places?," To find the resolved shear stress on the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system, we need to calculate the angle between the crystallographic direction [321] and the slip direction [101], and then use Schmid's law.

First, we need to find the angle between [321] and [101]. We can use the Euler angles to represent the orientation of [321] with respect to the crystal axes. The Euler angles for [321] are (α, β, γ) = (60°, 45°, 90°).

The slip direction [101] is in the (1 1 -1) plane, which is the basal plane in fcc crystals. The normal to the basal plane is [0001], and the slip direction is in the plane, so the angle between [0001] and [101] is 90°.

To find the angle between [321] and [101], we need to find the rotation matrices that describe the transformation from the crystal axes to the [321] direction. The rotation matrices for the given Euler angles are:

Rx = [1 0 0]
Ry = [cos(β) sin(β) 0]
Rz = [cos(γ) -sin(γ) 0]

The direction cosines of [321] with respect to the crystal axes are:

[x, y, z] = Rx Ry Rz [1 0 0]^T
= [cos(60°) cos(45°) cos(90°)
sin(60°) cos(45°) cos(90°)
sin(45°) sin(45°) cos(90°)]
= [0.5, 0.866, 0]

The direction cosines of [101] with respect to the crystal axes are:

[x, y, z] = [1, 0, -1]

To find the angle between [321] and [101], we can use the dot product:

cos(θ) = x1*x1' + y1*y1' + z1*z1'

where x1, y1, z1 are the direction cosines of [321], and x1', y1', z1' are the direction cosines of [101].

cos(θ) = 0.5*1 + 0.866*0 + 0*(-1)
= 0.5 + 0 = 0.5

θ = arccos(0.5) = 60°

Now we can use Schmid's law to find the resolved shear stress:

τ = τm sin(θ) cos(λ)

where τm is the applied tensile stress, θ is the angle between the crystallographic direction and the slip direction, and λ is the angle between the slip plane normal and the applied stress.

In this case, the slip plane normal is [0001], and the slip direction is [101]. The applied stress is along [321], so the angle between the applied stress and the slip plane normal is θ = 60°. The angle between the slip direction and the slip plane normal is λ = 90° - θ = 30°.

τ = 10 MPa sin(60°) cos(30°)
= 10 MPa * 0.5 * √3/2

W = ∫∫pdA dV

where p is the pressure, A is the cross-sectional area, and dV is the volume element. Since the flow stress is constant, we can simplify the equation as:

W = ∫∫pdA dl

where dl is the length element.

First, we need to find the extrusion ratio, R:

R = A1 / A2 = (πD12) / (πD22) = (D1 / D2)2

Given that D1 = 20 mm and D2 = 16 mm, we have:

R = (20 / 16)2 = 1.5625

Next, we can find the pressure using the equation for ideal plastic deformation:

p = Y / (1 - 1 / e)

where Y is the flow stress, e is the strain, and 1 - 1 / e is the reduction in area. Since the strain is given as the ratio of the final diameter to the initial diameter, we have:

e = D2 / D1 = 16 / 20 = 0.8

Substituting the given flow stress of 40 MPa, we get:

p = 40 MPa / (1 - 1 / 0.8) = 80 MPa

Now, we can calculate the work done:

W = ∫∫80π(D1/2)2 dl

Integrating over the length of the billet (100 mm), we get:

W = 80π∫(D1/2)2 dl = 80π∫(10/2)2 dl = 80π∫(25) dl = 80π(25)(100) = 12,566.4 J

Let ρ be the density of the material, A1 be the cross-sectional area before rolling before the reduction, and A2 be the cross-sectional area after the reduction. We have:

n = [011]

C. (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]

α = 2 sin⁻¹(Rp / (h1 sin²(α/2)))

where Rp is the roll radius. We can solve these equations iteratively to find the maximum possible reduction.

First, we can find the angle of contact using the given roll diameter and coefficient of friction:

α = 2 sin⁻¹(μ / (1 + μ²))
α = 2 sin⁻¹(0.2 / (1 + 0.2²))
α ≈ 1.31 radians

h1 = rmax * C0 * sin²(α/2)
h1 = rmax * C0 * sin²(1.31 / 2)

We can use the given roll diameter and coefficient of friction to find the maximum possible reduction:

Rp = 200 mm
μ = 0.2
C0 = 4

α = 1.31 radians

h1 = rmax * C0 * sin²(1.31 / 2)
h1 = rmax * 4 * sin²(0.655)

We can solve this equation iteratively to find the maximum possible reduction:

rmax = h1 / (C0 sin²(α/2))
rmax = h1 / (4 sin²(0.655))
rmax = h1 / (4 * 0.642)
rmax = h1 / 2.57

h1 = rmax * C0 * sin²(1.31 / 2)

","To calculate the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume, we can use the equation for the true strain, ε = ln(A0/A), where A0 is the initial cross-sectional area and A is the final cross-sectional area. We are given that the initial diameter is 30 mm and the final diameter is 20 mm.

First, let's find the initial and final cross-sectional areas:

A0 = π(30 mm)² = 942.48 cm² = 942.48 × 10⁻⁴ m²
A = π(20 mm)² = 314.16 cm² = 314.16 × 10⁻⁴ m²

Now, we can calculate the true strain:

ε = ln(A0/A) = ln(942.48/314.16) = 0.522

Next, we can find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume using the given flow behavior equation:

W = ∫σdεdV = ∫350 MPa × 350⁁(0.3) MPa⁻¹ × εdV

Since the deformation is axial and the volume remains constant, we can use the equation for the work done in axial deformation:

W = ∫σdεdV = ∫350 MPa × 350⁁(0.3) MPa⁻¹ × εdAdL

Substituting the given values:

W = 350 MPa × 350⁁(0.3) MPa⁻¹ × 0.522 × π(30 mm) × (30 mm - 20 mm)

1. Calculate the number of mer units in 50 g of natural rubber:
   The molecular weight of a mer unit is 68 amu.
   Therefore, the number of mer units in 50 g of natural rubber is:
   50 g / 68 amu/mer = 7.35 x 10²² mer units

2. Calculate the number of sulfur atoms in 10 g of sulfur:

First, let's convert the weight percentage to moles per unit volume:

C = 6% * (7.87 g/cm³) = 0.047222 mol/cm³

Now, we can find the atomic percentage by dividing the number of carbon atoms by the total number of atoms in 1 cm³ of iron:

1 cm³ of iron contains (7.87 g/cm³) / (56 g/mol) = 0.139 g/mol

The total number of atoms in 0.139 g/mol of iron is:

N = (0.139 g/mol) * (6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol) = 8.55 × 10²² atoms

Agitation of melt

Explanation: In zone refining, impurities are preferentially collected at the ends of the bar due to their rejection by the solidifying interface. The separation of impurities is facilitated by the formation of a narrow zone of melt, which allows for the solid and liquid phases to have different compositions. The conditions that favour this separation include an increase in the gap between solidus and liquidus lines (A), which increases the driving force for impurity separation, and a low cooling rate of the melt (D), which allows for longer diffusion lengths and more efficient impurity redistribution.

(round off to the nearest integer) "," To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½, we need to find the number of months where there is no accident with a probability of at least 50%.

Since the probability of an accident in a single month is 1/100, the probability of no accident in a single month is 99/100.

The probability of no accident in 'n' months is given by the product of the probabilities of no accident in each month:

P(n) = (99/100) ^ n

To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½, we need to find the smallest integer 'n' such that (99/100) ^ n ≤ ½.

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, we get:

n log10(99/100) ≤ log10(1/2)

(round off to 2 decimal places) ","To find the required side of the cubic green compact, we first need to determine the weight of the green compact and the volume of the solid material in the sintered cube.

1. Weight of the green compact:
The weight of the green compact is given by its density and volume. The volume of the green compact is equal to the volume of the sintered cube minus the volume of porosity.

Volume of green compact = Volume of sintered cube - Volume of porosity
= (6.60 g/cm³) × (2 cm)³ - (0.18) × (6.76 g/cm³) × (2 cm)³
= 13.26 cm³ - 3.55 cm³
= 9.71 cm³

Weight of green compact = Density × Volume
= 6.76 g/cm³ × 9.71 cm³
= 64.5 g

2. Volume of the solid material in the sintered cube:
The volume of the solid material in the sintered cube is equal to the volume of the sinteredentered cube minus the volume of porosity.

Volume of solid material = Volume of sintered cube - Volume of porosity
= (6.76 g/cm³) × (2 cm)³ - (0.18) × (6.76 g/cm³) × (2 cm)³
= 11.55 cm³

3. Required side of the cubic green compact:
The required side of the cubic green compact is equal to the cube root of the volume of the solid material in the green compact.

Side of the green compact = ∛(Volume of solid material)
= ∛(6.76 g/cm³ × (required side)³)
= ∛(11.55 cm³)

Using the quadratic formula, we can find the required side of the cubic green compact:

required side = ∛(11.55 cm³)
= √[ (1/3) × (11.55 cm³) + (2/3)² ]
= √[ (1/3) × 11.55 + (2/3)² ]

Mole fraction of CaO: $X_(CaO)$ = (wt.% CaO / 100) / (sum of wt.% of all components) = 55 / (55 + 20 + 15 + 10) = 0.52

Mole fraction of MgO: $X_(MgO)$ = wt.% MgO / 100 = 10 / 100 = 0.1

Mole fraction of Al2O3: $X_(Al_(2)O_(3))$ = wt.% Al2O3 / 100 = 15 / 100 = 0.15

Mole fraction of SiO2: $X_(SiO_2)$ = wt.% SiO2 / 100 = 20 / 100 = 0.2

log $C_s$ = 3.44* (0.52 + 0.1*0.1 -0.8*0.15 - 0.2) - (9894/1900) + 2.05

Using the atomic weights given, we can convert wt.% to mole fractions:

$X_(CaO)$ = (wt.% CaO / 100) / (sum of atomic weights of all components) = 55 / (40*55 + 24*20 + 28*15 + 27*10 + 16*35) = 0.52

$X_(MgO)$ = wt.% MgO / 100 = 10 / 100 = 0.1

$X_(Al_(2)O_(3))$ = wt.% Al2O3 / 100 = 15 / 100 = 0.15

$X_(SiO_2)$ = wt.% SiO2 / 100 = 20 / 100 = 0.2

Explanation:

The given options represent different methods of quenching, which is the process of rapidly cooling a hot substance. The severity of quenching depends on how quickly the temperature drops and whether any phase transitions occur during the process.

1. Oil quenching (P): This method involves immersing the hot substance in oil. Oil has a lower cooling capacity than water, so the cooling rate is slower. No phase transitions occur during oil quenching, making it the least severe quenching method.
2. Water quenching (Q): This method involves immersing the hot substance in water. Water has a higher cooling capacity than oil, so the cooling rate is faster. However, a thin layer of insulating oxide may form on the surface of the substance, which can slow down the cooling process. No phase transitions occur during water quenching.
3. Water quenching with agitation (R): This method involves immersing the hot substance in water while agitating it to remove the insulating oxide layer and promote better heat transfer. The cooling rate is faster than in still water due to the increased surface area and turbulence. However, the risk of quench cracking (a type of thermal stress cracking) is higher with agitation.
4. Brine quenching (S): This method involves immersing the hot substance in a brine solution (saltwater). Brine has a higher cooling capacity than water due to the presence of salt, which lowers the boiling point and increases the heat of vaporization. Additionally, the high salt concentration can help prevent oxidation and corrosion. However, the high salt concentration can also increase the risk of hydrogen embrittlement (a type of material failure) in some metals. The risk of phase transitions, such as the formation of hydrates, is also higher with brine quenching.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) P<Q<S<R, with oil quenching being the least severe and brine quenching being the most severe.",,,0,

Explanation:

The assertion (a) states that deoxidation and decarburisation of liquid steel are done by vacuum treatment process. However, this is not always true. Vacuum treatment is one of the methods used for deoxidation and decarburisation, but other methods such as the addition of deoxidizers and reducing agents are also commonly used.

The reason (r) states that decreased partial pressure of CO(g) promotes deoxidation and decarburisation. This statement is true. In the vacuum treatment process, the partial pressure of CO(g) is reduced, which promotes the reaction between the impurities (oxygen and carbon) in the liquid steel and the reducing agents (such as aluminum or silicon) added to the steel. This leads to the removal of oxygen and carbon from the steel, resulting in a cleaner and purer product.

Based on Chvorinov's rule, the solidified thickness (in cm) after 4 minutes is?","To find the solidified thickness after 4 minutes using Chvorinov's rule, we need to calculate the casting modulus (M) and the Chvorinov constant (B).

Given:
Thickness of solidified layer after 2 minutes = 3 cm

First, let's find the casting modulus (M):
M = V / A
Where V is the volume of the casting and A is the contact surface area of the metal-mold interface.

For a rectangular slab:
V = lwh
A = 2lw

Substituting the given thickness (3 cm) for w and assuming the length (l) to be 6 cm, we have:

V = 6 × 3 = 18 cm³
A = 2 × 6 × 3 = 18 cm²

M = 18 / 18 = 1 cm⁻¹

Now, let's find the Chvorinov constant (B):
B = παm / [ρs / (ΔHf / km)²]
Where αm is the thermal diffusivity of the sand, ρs is the density of the solidified metal, ΔHf is the latent heat of fusion, and km is the thermal conductivity of the sand.

Assuming the values given in the context:
αm = 2.5310⁻²m²/s
ρs = 7265 kg/m³
ΔHf = 2.8310⁵J/kg
km = 0.3 W/m·K

B = π × 2.5310⁻² × 10² / [7265 × 10³ / (2.8310⁵ × 10³ / 0.3)²]
B = 4.50 min⁻¹

Now, we can use Chvorinov's rule to find the solidified thickness after 4 minutes:

s(t) = Mt²

Substituting the values we have:

s(t) = 1 × (4)² = 16 cm

Explanation:

The production of low silicon pig iron in a blast furnace requires a lower temperature and higher basicity. The reason for this is that at lower temperatures, the silica in the iron ore reacts more readily with the lime (CaO) in the basic flux to form a slag, which floats on top of the molten iron. The high basicity of the flux helps to promote the formation of the slag and the separation of the silica from the iron.

Mass of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ in the ore = 1000 kg * 0.95 (fraction of iron ore)

Integrate term by term:

Mass of CaO in hot metal = 100 metric ton × 93.2 wt.% = 93.2 metric ton
Mass of Fe in hot metal = 100 metric ton × (100% - 93.2 wt.%) = 6.8 metric ton

Mass of CaO in lime = 5 metric ton × 90 wt.% = 4.5 metric ton

Next, we need to calculate the mass of slag produced during refining. We can use the given composition of the slag (40 wt.% CaO and 22 wt.% FeO) to determine the mass of CaO and Fe in the slag.

Mass of CaO in slag = 100 metric ton × 40 wt.% = 40 metric ton
Mass of FeO in slag = 100 metric ton × 22 wt.% = 22 metric ton

Since the mass of CaO in the slag is equal to the mass of CaO in the lime used, we can calculate the mass of Fe in the slag by subtracting the mass of CaO in the slag from the total mass of the slag.

Mass of Fe in slag = 100 metric ton - 40 metric ton = 60 metric ton

pO = hO × (wt.%O)

Since we are given that (wt.%C)(wt.%O) = K, we can write:

(wt.%C) = K / (wt.%O)

Substituting this into the equation for pO, we get:

pO = hO × (K / (wt.%O))

Now, we can find pO' by dividing pO by the ratio of the partial pressures of CO at the two conditions:

pO' = pO / (pCO / pCO') = hO × (K / (wt.%O)) / (1 / 0.1)

Substituting this into the equation for K', we get:

K' = (0.1 / hC) × (hO / [hO × (K / (wt.%O)) / (1 / 0.1)])

Simplifying this equation, we get:

K' = 0.01 × (wt.%O / K)

Now, we want to find K'. Since we are given that K = 0.002 when pCO = 1 atm, we can use this information to find K in terms of wt.%O:

0.002 = (1 / hC) × (hO / 1)

Solving for hO / hC, we get:

hO / hC = 2

Now, we can use this information to find K when pCO = 0.1 atm:

K' = 0.01 × (wt.%O / K)

K' = 0.01 × (wt.%O / (1 / (hO / hC)))

K' = 0.01 × (wt.%O / 2)

K' = 0.005 × wt.%O

Now, we want to find the value of K when wt.%O = 0.06 (the answer choice A). Substituting this value into the equation for K', we get:

K' = 0.005 × 0.06


K' = 0.0003

However, this value does not match any of the answer choices. Let's check the other answer choices to see if any of them are correct.

When wt.%O = 0.002 (answer choice B), we get:

K' = 0.005 × 0.002

K' = 0.0001

This value is also not a match.

When wt.%O = 0.02 (answer choice C), we get:

K' = 0.005 × 0.02

K' = 0.0001

This value is also not a match.

When wt.%O = 0.0002 (answer choice D), we get:

K' = 0.005 × 0.0002

K' = 0.000001

This value is also not a match.

Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. It is likely that there is an error inaccuracy in the problem statement or the given data.",,,0,

(A) The lower atomic weight element is leached (B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached (C) The more electronegative element is leached (D) The element with lower density is leached,"The answer is (A) The lower atomic weight element is leached.

Explanation:
The given context discusses the selective leaching of a binary alloy, specifically in the context of the MCC1 and MCC2 tests. The text states that the results obtained give undetectable concentration values for certain elements, including Ce, Ti, Zr, Al, and Fe, which are below the WRF detection limit (<1 ppm). For Ca, the evolution of concentrations according to time increases slowly in MCC1 test and reaches a maximum of 27.8 10-3 kg/m3 at the 36th day. In MCC2 test, the Ca concentrations seem to decrease and suddenly show a maximum value after the 36th day. The text also mentions that the nature of the solute layer at the solid-liquid interface can be no mixing, partial mixing, or complete mixing.

The statement (A) ""The lower atomic weight element is leached"" is true based on the information provided in the context. The text does not explicitly state that the lower atomic weight element is the one being leached, but it does mention that certain elements, such as Ce, Ti, Zr, Al, and Fe, have undetectable concentrations in the leachate, implying that they are not being leached. The text also mentions that Ca, which has a lower atomic weight than the other elements in the alloy, shows a significant change in concentration during the leaching process. Therefore, it can be inferred that the lower atomic weight element is more likely to be leached under the conditions described in the context.

A blast furnace uses hematite ore with 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. It uses 600 kg coke per ton of hot metal. The coke contains 85% C and 15%ash. The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5%C.

The weight of iron in the hot metal is given as 95.5% of 1 ton = 0.955 x 1000 kg = 955 kg.

The weight of iron in the iron ore can be calculated by finding the weight of Fe2O3 in the iron ore and converting it to iron using the formula Fe2O3 -> 2Fe + 3O2.

The weight of Fe2O3 in the iron ore is given as 80% of 1 ton = 0.8 x 1000 kg = 800 kg.

The weight of iron in the iron ore can be calculated as follows:

Weight of iron = (Weight of Fe2O3 / (Weight of Fe2O3 + Weight of gangue)) x Weight of iron ore

Weight of gangue = Weight of iron ore - Weight of Fe2O3

Weight of gangue = 1000 kg - 800 kg = 200 kg

Weight of iron = (800 kg / (800 kg + 200 kg)) x 1000 kg = 800 kg

Now that we have the weight of iron in the iron ore, we can calculate the weight of iron ore required to produce 1 ton of hot metal:

Weight of iron ore = Weight of iron / (1 - (Weight of gangue / Weight of iron ore))

Weight of iron ore = 800 kg / (1 - (200 kg / (800 kg + 200 kg))) = 1067 kg

To find the weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal, we need to find the weight of gangue materials in the iron ore and the weight of ash in the coke.

The weight of gangue materials in the iron ore is given as 20% of the weight of iron ore = 20% x 1067 kg = 213.4 kg.

The weight of ash in the coke is given as 15% of the weight of coke = 15% x 600 kg = 90 kg.

The weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal is the sum of the weight of gangue materials in the iron ore and the weight of ash in the coke:

Weight of slag = Weight of gangue in iron ore + Weight of ash in coke

Weight of slag = 213.4 kg + 90 kg = 303.4 kg

Explanation: In the BOF steelmaking process, phosphorus is removed by oxidizing it to form P2O5, which then dissolves in the slag. The activity of P2O5 in the slag is much less than one, which allows for selective oxidation of phosphorus from the iron. However, FeO also dissolves in the slag, and its activity coefficient is much greater than that of P2O5. This causes line (x) in the phase diagram to rotate clockwise slightly, but without changing the overall picture. The effect of oxidizing the phosphorus and lowering its concentration in iron below 1 mass% causes line (b) to rotate anticlockwise to positions (c) and (d) at 0.1 and 0.01 mass%P, respectively. Total elimination of phosphorus from the iron is not possible since a concentration is reached at which the line crosses that for FeO formation at the oxidation temperature and from then on the iron is oxidised preferentially.

Therefore, a higher temperature is desirable for effective phosphorus removal in the BOF steelmaking process, as it increases the reaction rate and allows for a greater concentration gradient between the iron and the slag, which drives the reaction forward.

The rate of oxidation of nickel is controlled by the rate of transport of oxygen through the concentration boundary layer. The rate of oxidation (in moles of nickel per minute (mol/min), rounded off to two decimal places) is"," To calculate the rate of oxidation of nickel, we first need to determine the oxygen concentration at the edge of the boundary layer. We can use the given boundary layer mass transfer coefficient and the ideal gas law to find the oxygen mole fraction at the edge of the boundary layer.

First, let's find the total pressure and the partial pressure of oxygen at the edge of the boundary layer. Since the total pressure is 1 atm and the gas mixture contains 40% oxygen by volume, the partial pressure of oxygen is:

P\_O2 = (0.4) × 1 atm = 0.4 atm

Next, we can use the ideal gas law to find the oxygen mole fraction at the edge of the boundary layer:

M\_O2 = 32.0 g/mol (molar mass of oxygen)
P\_O2 / (RT) = (n\_O2 / V) = (x\_O2 / M\_total)

where M\_total is the total mass of gas in the boundary layer, V is the volume of the boundary layer, and n\_O2 is the number of moles of oxygen in the boundary layer.

We can assume that the volume of the boundary layer is proportional to the square of its radius, r\_b. The radius of the boundary layer can be found using the Schmidt number, which is the ratio of the molecular diffusivity of a gas to its kinematic viscosity. For oxygen in air, the Schmidt number is approximately 0.7.

The thickness of the boundary layer, δ, can be found using the boundary layer mass transfer coefficient and the kinematic viscosity of air:

δ = (v / Sh) = (v / (Sh × Re^(1/2)))

where v is the kinematic viscosity of air, Sh is the Sherwood number, and Re is the Reynolds number.

The Reynolds number can be calculated using the diameter of the sphere and the velocity of the gas at the edge of the boundary layer, which can be estimated using the mass transfer coefficient and the molar diffusivity of oxygen in air.

Once we have the thickness of the boundary layer, we can find the volume of the boundary layer and the number of moles of oxygen in the boundary layer.

Finally, we can use the ideal gas law to find the oxygen mole fraction at the edge of the boundary layer:

x\_O2 = P\_O2 / P\_total = P\_O2 / (P\_O2 + P\_Ar) = P\_O2 / (P\_O2 + (1 - P\_O2) × 1 atm)

Using these values, we can calculate the rate of oxidation of nickel using the rate equation:

r\_Ni = (D\_O2 × A\_surface × (x\_O2\_edge^2 - x\_O2\_surface^2) / δ)

where D\_O2 is the molecular diffusivity of oxygen in air, A\_surface is the surface area of the sphere, and x\_O2\_surface is the oxygen mole fraction at the surface of the sphere (which is 0 in this case).

We know that the mass of sulfur in the steel before desulfurization is 1500 kg, and the mass of sulfur in the steel after desulfurization is 250 kg. The difference between these masses is the amount of sulfur removed during desulfurization.

(A) 0.14 (B) 0.30 (C) 0.70 (D) 0.86,"To determine the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, we first need to find the number of monomer units of each type in the copolymer. We know that the molecular weight of the copolymer is 10520 g/mol and the degree of polymerization is 160.

Let's assume that the molecular weight of one monomer unit of vinyl chloride is 62 g/mol and the molecular weight of one monomer unit of vinyl acetate is 102 g/mol. Then, the number of monomer units of vinyl chloride (n1) and vinyl acetate (n2) in the copolymer can be calculated as follows:

n1 = (MW of copolymer) / (MW of vinyl chloride) = 10520 / 62 = 168.52 ≈ 169
n2 = (MW of copolymer) / (MW of vinyl acetitic acid) = 10520 / 102 = 103.55 ≈ 104

The total number of monomer units in the copolymer is n1 + n2 = 169 + 104 = 273.

Now, we can calculate the degree of polymerization using the following formula:

DP = MW / MWu

where MW is the molecular weight of the polymer and MWu is the molecular weight of a repeating unit.

Plugging in the values, we get:

Material Applications,11,G-XEC-2014-18,NUM,31,Given: ($M_(Ga)$ = 69.72 g/mol; $M_(As)$ = 74.92 g/mol). The weight in kg of gallium (Ga) to be mixed with arsenic (As) for obtaining 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs) is," To find the weight of gallium required to produce 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide, we first need to determine the molar ratio of gallium to arsenic in GaAs. The molar mass of GaAs is the sum of the molar masses of gallium and arsenic:

$M_(GaAs) = M_(Ga) + M_(As) = 69.72 g/mol + 74.92 g/mol = 144.64 g/mol$

Now, we want to find the weight of gallium that reacts with 1.0 kg of arsenic. Since the molar ratio of gallium to arsenic in GaAs is 1:1, we can set up a proportion:

$Ga : As = 1 : 1$

$M_(Ga) : M_(As) = m_(Ga) : m_(As)$

$69.72 g/mol : 74.92 g/mol = x : 1$

Solving for x, we get:

$x = \frac{69.72 g/mol}{74.92 g/mol} \approx 0.923$

Now, we can find the weight of gallium required:

$m_(Ga) = x \cdot m_(As)$

$m_(Ga) = 0.923 \cdot 1.0 kg \approx 0.923 kg$

Therefore, approximately 0.923 kg of gallium is needed to produce 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide.",,,0,

If the theoretical density of SiC is 3.22 g $cm^(-3)$ and that of $Al_2O_3$ is 3.95 g $cm^(-3)$, estimate the porosity (%) of the composite, assuming that the linear rule of mixtures is valid in this case."," To estimate the porosity of the composite, we can use the linear rule of mixtures assuming that the densities of the two phases are additive.

First, we need to find the total weight of the composite:

Total weight = (Volume of SiC whiskers) x (Theoretical density of SiC) + (Volume of $Al_2O_3$ matrix) x (Theoretical density of $Al_2O_3$)

Let V be the total volume of the composite. Then, the volume of SiC whiskers is 0.3V and the volume of $Al_2O_3$ matrix is (1 - 0.3)V.

Total weight = (0.3V) x (3.22 g $cm^(-3)$) + ((1 - 0.3)V) x (3.95 g $cm^(-3)$)

Total weight = 0.3 x 3.22V + 0.7 x 3.95V

Total weight = 3.22V + 2.7635V = 6.0035V

Now, we can find the actual mass of the composite from its measured bulk density:

Actual mass = Bulk density x Total volume = 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$ x V

Since we know the total weight and the actual mass, we can find the total volume:

Total volume = Actual mass / Bulk density = 6.0035V / 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$

Now, we can calculate the volume of the porosity:

Volume of porosity = Total volume - (Volume of SiC whiskers + Volume of $Al_2O_3$ matrix)

Volume of porosity = V - (0.3V + 0.7V)

Volume of porosity = V - 1V = 0V

However, we made an error in our calculation of the total weight earlier. The correct calculation should be:

Total weight = (Volume of SiC whiskers) x (Theoretical density of SiC) + (Volume of $Al_2O_3$ matrix) x (Theoretical density of $Al_2O_3$)

Total weight = (0.3V) x (3.22 g $cm^(-3)$) + ((1 - 0.3)V) x (3.95 g $cm^(-3)$)

Total weight = 0.3 x 3.22V + 0.7 x 3.95V = 3.22V + 2.5635V = 5.7835V

Now, we can find the actual mass again:

Actual mass = Bulk density x Total volume = 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$ x V

Since we know the total weight and the actual mass, we can find the total volume:

Total volume = Actual mass / Bulk density = 5.7835V / 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$

Now, we can calculate the volume of the porosity correctly:

Volume of porosity = Total volume - (Volume of SiC whiskers + Volume of $Al_2O_3$ matrix)

Volume of porosity = V - (0.3V + 0.7V)

Volume of porosity = V - 1V = 0V

This means that the composite is fully dense, and there is no porosity. However, the given bulk density is lower than the theoretical density of the composite, which indicates that there is some porosity or other defects in the material. The linear rule of mixtures assumption may not be valid in this case.

Therefore, we cannot estimate the porosity based on the given information.",,,0,

(Take the atomic weights for carbon and hydrogen as 12.01 g/mol and 1.008 g/mol, respectively and the avogadro's number as 6.023* $10^(23)$ repeat units/mol)","To find the density of a totally crystalline PE, we first need to find the mass of one unit cell and then divide it by the volume of the unit cell.

First, let's calculate the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in one ethylene repeat unit:

1 ethylene repeat unit = 2 C atoms + 2 H atoms

Number of carbon atoms = 2
Number of hydrogen atoms = 2

Now, let's calculate the mass of one ethylene repeat unit:

Mass of 1 C atom = 12.01 g/mol
Mass of 1 H atom = 1.008 g/mol

Mass of 1 ethylene repeat unit = (2 * 12.01 g/mol) + (2 * 1.008 g/mol) = 26.032 g/mol

Since there are 2 ethylene repeat units in one unit cell, the mass of one unit cell is:

Mass of 1 unit cell = 2 * 26.032 g/mol = 52.064 g/mol

Now, we can find the density of a totally crystalline PE by dividing the mass of one unit cell by its volume:

Density = Mass of 1 unit cell / Volume of 1 unit cell

Density = 52.064 g/mol / 0.0933 $nm^3$

To convert the volume to $cm^3$, we need to use the conversion factor:

1 $nm^3$ = 10^24 $cm^3$

So, the volume of 1 unit cell in $cm^3$ is:

Volume of 1 unit cell = 0.0933 $nm^3$ * 10^24 $cm^3$/ $nm^3$ = 9.11 * 10^22 $cm^3$

Now, we can calculate the density in $g/cm^3$:

Density = 52.064 g/mol / (9.11 * 10^22 $cm^3$) = 5.68 * 10^3 $g/cm^3$

Therefore, the density of a totally crystalline PE is approximately 5.68 * 10^3 $g/cm^3$.",,,0,

Calculate the density of the sample in g $cm^(-3)$ (give answer up to 2 decimal places)," To calculate the density of the sample, we can use the Archimedes method, which involves measuring the difference in weight of the sample in air and in water.

First, we need to find the volume of the sample in water when it is fully submerged. Since the sample displaces an equal volume of water when it is in the water, we can find its volume by measuring the weight of water displaced:

Weight of water displaced = Weight of sample in air - Weight of sample in water
= 2.67 g - 1.67 g
= 1.00 g

The volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the sample, so we can calculate the volume of the sample:

Volume of sample = Weight of water displaced / Density of water
= 1.00 g / 1.00 g $cm^(-3)$
= 1.00 $cm^3$

Therefore, the density of the sample is:

Density of sample = Mass of sample / Volume of sample

Explanation:

Group I:
P - Reduction: This technique involves the reduction of metal oxides or salts to produce metal powders. It does not directly determine the shape of the powder.

Q - Gas Atomization: This technique involves melting the metal and then atomizing it into fine droplets using a high-pressure gas stream. The shape of the powder depends on the cooling rate and the conditions during solidification.

R - Milling: This technique involves grinding or milling larger particles into smaller ones. The shape of the powder depends on the milling conditions and the properties of the starting material.

S - Electrolysis: This technique involves passing an electric current through an electrolyte to deposit metal ions onto a cathode. The shape of the powder depends on the conditions during deposition and the properties of the electrolyte.

Group II:
1 - Flaky: This shape refers to powders that have a flat, plate-like structure.

2 - Spongy: This shape refers to powders that have a porous, open structure, like a sponge.

3 - Dendritic: This shape refers to powders that have a tree-like structure, with branches growing out from a central point.

Material Applications,32,G-META-15-9,MCQS,63,Self supporting arches for furnace roofs can be fabricated using silica bricks but not using magnesia bricks. Why?  (A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures. (B) Silica has a significantly higher thermal conductivity than magnesia at high temperatures. (C) Silica has a significantly lower melting point than magnesia. (D) Silica is significantly more acidic than magnesia.," The correct answer is (A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures.

Explanation:

The question asks why self-supporting arches for furnace roofs can be fabricated using silica bricks but not using magnesia bricks. The answer lies in the thermal properties of these materials at high temperatures.

Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia. This means that silica expands less than magnesia when heated, making it less likely to crack or deform under the thermal stresses that occur in a furnace roof. In contrast, magnesia has a higher thermal expansion coefficient, which makes it more prone to cracking and deformation under thermal stresses.

Therefore, the lower thermal expansion coefficient of silica makes it a better choice for fabricating self-supporting arches for furnace roofs.

The other options in the question are incorrect:

(B) Silica has a significantly higher thermal conductivity than magnesia at high temperatures. This is not true. In fact, silica has a lower thermal conductivity than magnesia.

(C) Silica has a significantly lower melting point than magnesia. This is not true. Magnesia has a lower melting point than silica.

(D) Silica is significantly more acidic than magnesia. This is not true. Both silica and magnesia are basic oxides and are not acidic.",,,0,

(D) Yield point phenomenon occurs.,"The INCORRECT statement related to the effect of a small amount of carbon addition on mechanical properties of iron is (A) Ductile-Brittle-Transition-Temperature (DBTT) increases.

Explanation: A small amount of carbon addition to iron can lead to the formation of formation of martensite, which is a very hard but brittle material. However, the DBTT of iron actually decreases with the addition of carbon due to the interaction between carbon and dislocations, which makes the material more brittle at lower temperatures. Therefore, statement (A) is incorrect.

(C) addition of plasticizers. (D) annealing","The correct answer is (B) increasing the cross-link density.

Explanation:

The context provided mentions that epoxies have a very low resistance to fatigue crack initiation and propagation, which limits their use in engineering applications. To enhance the fatigue life of epoxy, various attempts have been made by reinforcing it with fibers and particulates. The smaller particles (0.2 µm) have resulted in greater improvement in the resistance to fatigue crack propagation (FCP) than larger particles (1.5 µm). The temperature rise during fatigue loading causes the formation of voids and microcracks, which can lead to composite failure. To prevent this, increasing the cross-link density in epoxies can enhance their creep resistance.

Therefore, the answer is (B) increasing the correct answer is (B) increasing the cross-link density.

* Creep resistance (P) is typically achieved by fine grained two-phase microstructures (3) or coherent precipitates (3) that hinder dislocation motion and grain boundary sliding.
* Elastic modulus enhancement (Q) is often associated with single crystal (2) materials due to their lack of grain boundaries, which can scatter phonons and reduce the effective elastic stiffness.
* Superplasticity (R) is a property of materials that exhibit large plastic deformation rates at relatively low temperatures and high strains. This property is often observed in coarse grained materials (1) due to the presence of grain boundaries that act as obstacles to dislocation motion, leading to a high density of dislocations and increased mobility.
* Increased strength (S) can be achieved by various microstructural features, including fine grained two-phase microstructures (3), coherent precipitates (3), and glass fibres in epoxy (4). The exact microstructural feature that leads to increased strength depends on the specific material system and processing conditions.

Explanation:

For creep resistance, increasing the grain size reduces the creep rate due to the lower grain boundary areas per unit volume available for sliding, which results in a lower creep rate and higher resistance to creep.

For tensile strength, adding dispersoids hinders dislocation movement and forces them to climb or cross-slip, which increases the strength of the material. The dispersoids also retain their hardness almost to the melting point, which further enhances the tensile strength.

Annealing, on the other hand, can increase the grain size and improve the overall crystalline structure of the material, but it can also reduce the strength and hardness of the material due to the recovery process. Therefore, it is not the best option for enhancing both creep resistance and tensile strength.",,,0,

Material Applications,51,G-META-22-58,NUM,27,A sieve made of steel wire of diameter 53 µm has an aperture size of 74 µm. Its mesh number is? (round off to the nearest integer). ,"The mesh number of a sieve is the number of openings per inch, and since the aperture size is given in micrometers, we need to convert it to inches first.

1 inch = 25,400 µm

So,
Aperture size = 74 µm = 74/25,400 inches = 0.00289 inches

The mesh number is the reciprocal of the linear density of the wire, which is the number of wires per inch. Since the wire diameter is given, we can calculate the linear density as follows:

Linear density = √(π/4) * (diameter/12)²

Diameter = 53 µm = 53/1,000,000 inches = 0.000053 inches


Linear density = √(π/4) * (0.000053)² = 0.000102 inches⁻¹

The mesh number is the reciprocal of the linear density, so:

Mesh number = 1/0.000102 = 980.4

Material Applications,52,G-META-22-65,NUM,53,"The equilibrium microstructure of an alloy A-B consists of two phases α and β in the molar proportion 2:1. If the overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B and the composition of β is 90 mol% B, the composition(in mol% B) of α is ? (round off to the nearest integer). ","To find the composition of phase α, we can use the lever rule. Let xα be the composition of phase α in mol%, and xβ be the composition of phase β in mol%. We know that the overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B, and the composition of phase β is 90 mol% B. Therefore, the composition of phase α must beats 100 - 90 = 10 mol% A.

Using the lever rule, we have:

molar proportion of α : molar proportion of β = mass ratio of α : mass ratio of β

Since the molar proportion of α and β is 2 : 1, and the mass ratio of α and β is xα : xβ, we have:

xα : xβ = 1 : 2
xα : (1 - xα) = 1 : 2

During cooling from 900°C to 723°C, the proeutectoid α forms from γ. Find the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel.   (A) 44.9% (B) 66.1% (C) 55.1% (D) 34.9% ","To find the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel, we need to use the lever rule. The lever rule states that the ratio of the mass of the solid solution (γ) to the total mass of the solution (γ + α) is equal to the ratio of the length of the lever arm for the solid solution to the total length of the lever arm.

In this case, the mass percentage of carbon in the solid solution (γ) is 0.8 wt.%, and the mass percentage of carbon in the proeutectoid α is 0.02 wt.%. The mass percentage of carbon in $Fe_3C$ is 6.67 wt.%.

First, we need to find the mass percentage of $Fe_3C$ in the steel just below 723°C. Since the steel is cooled slowly, all of the carbon that is present in excess of 0.02 wt.% will form $Fe_3C$. Therefore, the mass percentage of $Fe_3C$ is:

$$m_{Fe_3C} = m_{C} - m_{\alpha}$$

$$m_{Fe_3C} = 0.45\% - 0.02\% = 0.43\%$$

Next, we can use the lever rule to find the volume % of proeutectoid α:

$$\frac{m_{\gamma}}{m_{\gamma} + m_{\alpha}} = \frac{l_{\gamma}}{l_{\gamma} + l_{\alpha}}$$

$$\frac{m_{\gamma}}{m_{\gamma} + m_{\alpha}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{m_{\alpha}}{m_{\gamma}}}$$

$$\frac{m_{\gamma}}{m_{\gamma} + m_{\alpha}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{m_{Fe_3C}}{m_{\gamma}-m_{\alpha}}}$$

$$\frac{m_{\gamma}}{m_{\gamma} + m_{\alpha}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{0.43\%}{0.8\%-0.02\%}}$$

$$\frac{m_{\gamma}}{m_{\gamma} + m_{\alpha}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{0.053}{0.798}}$$

$$\frac{m_{\gamma}}{m_{\gamma} + m_{\alpha}} = \frac{1}{1.063}$$

$$\frac{m_{\gamma}}{m_{\gamma} + m_{\alpha}} = 0.942$$

$$\frac{V_{\gamma}}{V_{\gamma} + V_{\alpha}} = \frac{m_{\gamma}}{m_{\gamma} + m_{\alpha}} \times \frac{V_{m}}{V_{m}}$$

$$\frac{V_{\gamma}}{V_{\gamma} + V_{\alpha}} = 0.942 \times \frac{1}{1.008}$$

$$\boxed{V_{\alpha} = 1 - 0.942 \times \frac{1}{1.008} = 0.058 \approx 5.8\%}$

Therefore, the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel is approximately 5.8%.

(round off to nearest integer) ","To find the weight percentage of B in the alloy, we can use the weight percentage of A in each phase and the given ratio of weight percentages of α and β phases.

First, let's find the weight percentage of A in the alloy:

Weight percentage of A in the alloy = (Weight percentage of A in α * Weight percentage of α) + (Weight percentage of A in β * Weight percentage of β)

Weight percentage of A in α = 70
Weight percentage of α = 4

Weight percentage of A in β = 20

(A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases (B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases (C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically (D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged ","The correct answer is (B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases.

Explanation:

The rate of transformation during a diffusional transformation (growth of β precipitates in an α matrix) is controlled by the diffusion of atoms in the α matrix to the precipitate-matrix interface. The mobility of atoms in the α matrix decreases with decreasing temperature, which makes it more difficult for atoms to move to the interface and form new precipitates. Therefore, the rate of transformation decreases with increasing undercooling.

However, at very large undercoolings, the thermodynamic driving force for the transformation becomes so large that it overcomes the decreased mobility of atoms in the α matrix, leading to an increase in the rate of transformation. Therefore, the rate of transformation first decreases and then increases with increasing undercooling.

The thermodynamic driving force for the transformation does increase monotonically with increasing undercooling, but this is not the only factor affecting the rate of transformation. The mobility of atoms in the α matrix is also important, and it decreases with decreasing temperature. Therefore, the rate of transformation does not increase monotonically with increasing undercooling.

The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is? (Round off to one decimal) ," To find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture, we first need to determine the mole fractions of A in each phase using the given information.

1. In phase α, the weight percentages of A and B are equal, so their mass fractions are also equal. Since the atomic mass of A is twice that of B, the number of moles of A in phase α is half the number of moles of B. Therefore, the mole fraction of A in phase α is 1/2.
2. In phase β, the mole fraction of A is twice that of B. Let x be the mole fraction of B in phase β. Then, the mole fraction of A in phase β is 2x.
3. The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β. Let M be the total number of moles in the two-phase mixture. Since there are equal numbers of moles in each phase, M = 2(number of moles in phase α) = 2(number of moles of A in phase α + number of moles of B in phase α).
4. The number of moles of A in phase α is half the number of moles of B in phase α. So, the number of moles of A in the two-phase mixture is M/2(number of moles of A in phase α) = M/2(2x) = Mx.
5. The number of moles of B in the two-phase mixture is M/2(number of moles of B in phase α) = M/2(1-2x) = Mx/2.
6. The total number of moles in the two-phase mixture is M = Mx + Mx/2 = (3/2)Mx.
7. The mole fraction of A in the two-phase mixture is (number of moles of A)/(total number of moles) = (Mx)/(3/2)Mx = 2/3.

The lever rule states that the weight percentage of each phase is proportional to the length of the lever arm from the eutectoid composition.

First, let's find the weight percentage of each phase at the eutectoid temperature (723°C).

The weight percentage of α-ferrite is 0.02 wt.%, and the weight percentage of $Fe_3C$ is 6.67 wt.%. The total weight percentage of these two phases is 6.69 wt.%.

The weight percentage of austenite (γ) at the eutectoid temperature is 100% - 6.69 wt.% = 93.31 wt.%.

Now, let's find the lever arm lengths for each phase. The lever arm length for α-ferrite is the difference between the carbon content of α-ferrite (0.02 wt.%) and the carbon content of the steel (0.45 wt.%). The lever arm length for $Fe_3C$ is the difference between the carbon content of $Fe_3C$ (6.67 wt.%) and the carbon content of the steel (0.45 wt.%).

The lever arm length for α-ferrite is 6.65 wt.%, and the lever arm length for $Fe_3C$ is -6.22 wt.%.

Now, we can use the lever rule to find the volume percentage of pearlite:

Volume % of pearlite = (Weight % of $Fe_3C$ * Lever arm length of $Fe_3C$) / (Total weight % of $Fe_3C$ and α-ferrite)

Volume % of pearlite = (6.67 wt.% * 6.22 wt.%) / (6.69 wt.%)

The pressure (in atm) required for α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is (round off to nearest integer) ","To find the pressure required for the transformation to occur at 723 K, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/P1) = ΔHtr/R ΔVtr/Ttr

where ΔHtr is the enthalpy of transformation, ΔVtr is the change in molar volume, and Ttr is the transition temperature.

First, we need to calculate ΔVtr:

ΔVtr = Vβ - Vα = 7.311103 cm3/mol - 7.377103 cm3/mol = -0.06 cm3/mol

Next, we can rearrange the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for P2:

P2 = P1 × exp(ΔHtr/R ΔVtr/Ttr)

We are given P1 = 1 atm = 1.01325 × 10^(5) Pa, ΔHtr = 912 J/mol, and Ttr = 773 K. We want to find P2 at Ttr = 723 K.

First, we need to convert the temperature to Kelvin:

Ttr = 723 K + 273.15 = 996.15 K

Now we can calculate P2:

P2 = 1.01325 × 10^(5) Pa × exp(912 J/mol / (8.314 J/(mol K) × (-0.06 cm3/mol) / 996.15 K)

Using a calculator, we find that P2 ≈ 1.015 atm.

Explanation: In an Ellingham diagram, the slope of a line represents the change in entropy (ΔS°) for the reaction at standard state. For the reaction $C(s) + O_2(g) = CO_2(g)$, the volume change is zero because one volume of $CO_2$ gas is produced from one volume of $O_2$ gas. Therefore, the net change in entropy is negligibly small (i.e., ΔS° = 0). However, the slope of the line is not zero because $CO_2$ is a gaseous oxide, and the entropy of gases is generally much larger than that of solids or liquids. Thus, the entropy change for the reaction per unit mass or mole is negative, resulting in a downward slope for the line representing the reaction in the Ellingham diagram.

(answer up to two decimal places)","To find the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature in an iron-carbon alloy, we can use the lever rule. According to the lever rule, the mass fractions of the liquid and solid phases in equilibrium at a given temperature are in the ratio of their compositions.

First, let's find the mass fractions of ferrite and pearlite in the eutectoid composition:

Ferrite mass fraction (Fe) = Mass percentage of carbon in ferrite / (100% - Mass percentage of carbon in ferrite)
= 0.025 / (100% - 0.025)
= 0.025 / 99.975
= 0.000253

Pearlite mass fraction (P) = 1 - Ferrite mass fraction
= 1 - 0.000253
= 0.999747

Now, let's find the mass fraction of pearlite in the given alloy:

Carbon mass fraction in alloy = 0.35
Carbon mass fraction in pearlite = Mass percentage of carbon in pearlite / 100%
= ?

Using the lever rule, we have:

(Carbon mass fraction in pearlite) / (1 - Carbon mass fraction in pearlite) = (Carbon mass fraction in alloy) / (1 - Carbon mass fraction in alloy)

(Carbon mass fraction in pearlite) / (1 - Carbon mass fraction in pearlite) = 0.35 / (1 - 0.35)

(Carbon mass fraction in pearlite) / (0.65) = 0.35 / 0.65

Carbon mass fraction in pearlite = 0.35 / 0.65
= 0.5385

Now, we can find the mass fraction of pearlite:

Pearlite mass fraction = Mass percentage of carbon in pearlite / 100%
= Carbon mass fraction in pearlite / (1 + Carbon mass fraction in pearlite)
= 0.5385 / (1 + 0.5385)
= 0.5385 / 1.5385
= 0.3487

So, the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature in an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C is approximately 0.3487 or 34.87%.",,,0,

where f is the fraction transformed, k is the rate constant, t is time, and n is the Avrami exponent. We are given n = 2 and f = 0.2 after 100 seconds. We need to find k.

First, let's find k:

ln(1 - 0.2) = -kt^2

Solving for k:

k = -ln(1 - 0.2) / (100^2)
k ≈ 0.00155

Now, we can find the transformation percentage after 400 seconds:

f = 1 - exp(-0.00155 * (400)^2)
f ≈ 0.46

So, the transformation is approximately 46% complete after 400 seconds.

The given context describes a situation where liquid steel is kept in a graphite crucible for a sufficiently long time to establish equilibrium. The activity of carbon in the liquid steel is given by the equation:

aC = aC(graphite) × (pCO/pCO(graphite))

Since the pressure of CO in the graphite crucible is equal to the pressure of CO in the liquid steel due to equilibrium, pCO/pCO(graphite) = 1. Therefore, aC = aC(graphite).

If liquid copper is cooled to 1353 K, magnitude of the driving force($J.mol^(-1)$) for liquid to transform to solid is?(round off to one decimal places)"," The driving force for liquid copper to transform to solid at a temperature of 1353 K is the difference between the enthalpy of liquid copper at 1353 K and the enthalpy of solid copper at the melting temperature of 1356 K. Therefore, the driving force is approximately 1 J.mol^(-1).

Explanation:

The given information states that the melting temperature of copper is 1356 K and the enthalpy of melting is 13 $KJ.mol^(-1)$. When liquid copper is cooled to 1353 K, it experiences a driving force to transform to the solid state due to the decrease in temperature. This driving force is equal to the difference in enthalpy between the liquid and solid states at this temperature.

To calculate the driving force, we need to find the enthalpy of liquid copper at 1353 K and the enthalpy of solid copper at 1356 K. Since the specific heat capacity of copper is given as 24.0 J/(mol K), we can use the following equation to find the enthalpy change of liquid copper:

ΔH = m * Cp * ΔT

where m is the mass of liquid copper, Cp is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change.

First, we need to find the mass of liquid copper at a volume of 1 m^3 (since the given data is in molar units, we need to convert to mass units):

m = ρ * V

where ρ is the density of liquid copper and V is the volume. The density of liquid copper at the melting temperature is given as 8.02 g/cm^3, so we can convert this to kg/m^3 and find the mass of 1 m^3 of liquid copper:

m = 8.02 g/cm^3 * (1 m^3 / 1000 cm^3/m^3) * 1000 kg/g = 7311.5 kg

Now we can find the enthalpy change of liquid copper from 1356 K to 1353 K:

ΔH_liquid = m * Cp * ΔT

ΔT = 1356 K - 1353 K = 3 K

ΔH_liquid = 7311.5 kg * 24.0 J/(mol K) * 3 K = 173,313.2 J = 173.3 kJ

Next, we can find the enthalpy of solid copper at the melting temperature:

ΔH_solid = ΔH_fusion = 13 $KJ.mol^(-1)$ * 63.55 g/mol = 821.8 kJ/kg

Now we can find the driving force:

Driving force = ΔH_liquid - ΔH_solid

Driving force = 173.3 kJ - 821.8 kJ/kg * 7311.5 kg = -638.5 kJ

However, this result is not physically meaningful, as it indicates that there is a negative driving force, which means that the system would not spontaneously transform from liquid to solid under these conditions. This is likely due to an error in the given data or a mistake in the calculation.

Therefore, we need to round off the answer to one decimal place, which is not possible for a negative number. Instead, we can conclude that the driving force for liquid copper to transform to solid at a temperature of 1353 K is approximately zero, as the enthalpy change of the liquid is very close to the enthalpy of the solid, and the difference is within the measurement error.

Alternatively, we could assume that the given data is incorrect and use a more reasonable value for the temperature difference, such as the superheat of 20°C given in the problem statement. In this case, the temperature difference would be 20 K instead of 3 K, and the driving force would be approximately 13.2 kJ/kg.

The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is?(round off to 2 decimal places). ,"The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure can be calculated using the lever rule based on the iron-carbon phase diagram. Since the steel sample is slowly cooled, the transformation to ferrite and cementite begins at the eutectoid temperature A1, which is dependent on the carbon content.

First, let's find the fractions of liquid and solid phases in equilibrium at the eutectoid temperature for the given carbon content of 0.6 wt.%. Using the enlarged phase diagram in Fig. 1.9, we can see that the mole fraction of liquid at the eutectoid temperature To is given by the ratio a/(a + b), where a and b are the mole fractions of the liquid and solid phases, respectively.

From the iron-carbon phase diagram in Fig. 1.8, we can see that for a carbon content of 0.6 wt.%, the steel is in the hypoeutectoid region, and the eutectoid temperature A1 is given. We can find the mole fractions a and b from the phase diagram.

Using the lever rule, we have:

a + b = 1

Since we know the mole fraction of the solid phase (ferrite) at the eutectoid temperature, we can find the mole fraction of the liquid phase:

a = 1 - b

Now, we need to convert the weight percentage to mole percentage. We have:

0.6 wt.% C = 0.006 mol/mol

Using the given phase diagram, we can find the mole fraction of the solid phase (ferrite) at the eutectoid temperature:

b = 0.12 (approximately)

Now, we can find the mole fraction of the liquid phase:

a = 1 - b = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88

Since the weight percentage of the proeutectoid ferrite is equal to the mole percentage of the solid phase, we have:

Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = 0.88

Rounded off to 2 decimal places, the answer is:

Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = 0.88

So, approximately 88% of the microstructure is composed of proeutectoid ferrite.",,,0,

If the anode lasts for 60 days, what is the average corrosion current (in Amperes) during that period?","To find the average corrosion current during the 60-day period, we first need to determine the mass loss of the Mg anode and then convert it to the equivalent current using the Faraday's constant.

First, let's calculate the mass loss of the Mg anode:

Mass loss = Mass of the anode (kg) × Time (days) / Density (kg/m³)

Mass loss = 1 kg × 60 days / 1,736 kg/m³

Mass loss = 0.00346 kg

Now, let's find the mass loss in grams:

Mass loss = 0.00346 kg × 1000 g/kg = 3.46 g

Next,

Now, let's find the equivalent mass of Mg ions lost during the corrosion process:

Equivalent mass = Mass loss (g) / Atomic weight (amu)

Equivalent mass = 3.46 g / 24.31 amu = 0.142 kg-eq

Now, let's find the equivalent current using the Faraday's constant:

Current = Equivalent mass (kg-eq) × Faraday constant (C/kg-eq)

Current = 0.1453 × 96,485 C/kg-eq = 42,161.65 C

Finally, let's convert the equivalent current to Amperes:

Current = 42,161.65 C / (60 days × 24 hours/day × 3600 seconds/hour) = 0.011 A

So, the average corrosion current during the 60-day period is approximately 0.011 Amperes.",,,0,

The concentration(in micro molar) of $Ni^(2+)$ in the solution is ","To find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution, we can use the Nernst equation for the galvanic cell. The Nernst equation relates the potential difference between two electrodes to the concentration difference of the ions involved in the reaction.

First, we need to calculate the standard electrode potential difference between the two half cells:

$E_{cell}^{o} = E_{Ni}^{o} - E_{Cd}^{o} = -0.250 V - (-0.403 V) = 0.153 V$

Next, we can use the Nernst equation to find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution:

$E_{cell} = E_{cell}^{o} - \frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{a_{Ni^{2+}}}{a_{Cd^{2+}}}\right)$

Since the pressure is standard state condition is 1 atm, and the temperature is given as 25°C, we can calculate the right-hand side of the equation:

$\frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{a_{Ni^{2+}}}{a_{Cd^{2+}}}\right) = \frac{(8.31 J/mol\cdot K)(298.15 K)}{(2)(96500 C/mol)}ln\left(\frac{a_{Ni^{2+}}}{1}\right)$

Since the voltage of the cell is zero, the left-hand side of the equation is also zero:

$E_{cell} = 0.153 V - \frac{(8.31 J/mol\cdot K)(298.15 K)}{(2)(96500 C/mol)}ln\left(\frac{a_{Ni^{2+}}}{1}\right) = 0$

To solve for $a_{Ni^{2+}}$, we can use the inverse logarithm function:

$ln\left(\frac{a_{Ni^{2+}}}{1}\right) = -\frac{(2)(96500 C/mol)(0.153 V)}{(8.31 J/mol\cdot K)(298.15 K)} = -0.0112$

$a_{Ni^{2+}} = e^{-0.0112} = 0.9888$

To find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution, we can use the definition of activity:

$a_{Ni^{2+}} = \gamma_{Ni^{2+}}[Ni^{2+}]$

Since we assumed that the solution is aqueous, and the activity coefficients for $Ni^{2+}$ ions in water at 25°C are close to unity, we can assume that $\gamma_{Ni^{2+}} \approx 1$. Therefore, we can find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions directly:

$[Ni^{2+}] = \frac{a_{Ni^{2+}}}{1} = \frac{0.9888}{1} = 0.9888 M = 988.8 \mu M$

Therefore, the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution is 988.8 micro molar.",,,0,

The average number of free electrons per atom in copper is ?," To find the average number of free electrons per atom in copper, we can use the electrical resistivity, electron mobility, and the density of copper.

First, we need to find the number of free electrons per unit volume (N) using the electrical resistivity and the electron mobility:

N = ρ / (me * μ)

where ρ is the electrical resistivity, me is the mass of an electron, and μ is the electron mobility.

Substituting the given values:

N = 1.7 * $10^(-8)$ Ωm / (9.11 * $10^(-31)$ kg * 3.2 * $10^(-3)$ m^2 V^(-1) s^(-1))
N = 8.48 * $10^28$ m^(-3)

Next, we can find the number of free electrons per atom by dividing the number of free electrons per unit volume by the density of copper:

The density of copper is given as:

ρ = 8.96 g/cm^3 = 8.96 * $10^3$ kg/m^3

So,

Number of free electrons per atom = N / ρ

= 8.48 * $10^28$ m^(-3) / 8.96 * $10^3$ kg/m^3

= 9.54 * $10^22$ electrons/atom

E = V / (2 * side)

where V is the applied voltage and side is the edge length of the cube.

E = 100 V / (2 * 1 cm) = 50 V/cm

v = μ * E

v = 4 * $10^4$ $cm^2$ $V^(-1)$ $s^(-1)$ * 50 V/cm = 2 * $10^5$ cm/s

Now, we can calculate the current density J:

J = n * e * v

J = $10^(12)$ $cm^(-3)$ * 1.6 * $10^(-19)$ C * 2 * $10^(5)$ cm/s = 3.2 * $10^(17)$ A/cm^2

Faraday constant is 96500 C/mol and the universal gas constant is 8.314 J/(mol.K)."," To calculate the absolute value of the cell potential, we can use the Nernst equation:

Ecell = E°cell - (RT / n) ln(a_(Cu, anode) / a_(Cu, cathode))

where:
- E°cell is the standard cell potential
- R is the universal gas constant
- T is the temperature in Kelvin
- n is the number of electrons transferred in the cell reaction
- a_(Cu, anode) and a_(Cu, cathode) are the activities of copper at the anode and cathode, respectively

For copper, the standard reduction potential is +0.34 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). Since copper is divalent, n = 2.

Given that the activity of copper at the anode is 0.8, and at the cathode it is assumed to be 1 (since it is pure copper), we can calculate the cell potential as follows:

Ni(s) + 2SO42-(aq) + 2e- Ni2+(aq) + 2SO32-(aq) E° = -0.251 V

Next, we need to calculate the reaction quotient Q for the given conditions. Since the anode is Cu-10 atom % Ni and the cathode is pure Ni, we can assume that the Ni concentration at the anode is lower than at the cathode. Therefore, the reaction is non-spontaneous in the forward direction, and we need to calculate the reverse reaction quotient Qr:

Qr = [Ni2+(aq)]c[Cu+(s)]c[SO32-(aq)]2[SO42-(aq)]2

We assume that the activities of the ions in the ideal solution are equal to their molalities. Therefore, we can use the molar concentrations instead of the activities:

[Ni2+(aq)] = 0.01 mol/L (assuming the total volume of the solution is 1 L)
[Cu+(s)] = 0.899 mol/L (assuming the mass of copper in the anode is 10 g, and its molar mass is 63.55 g/mol)
[SO32-(aq)] = 0.002 mol/L
[SO42-(aq)] = 0.002 mol/L

Substituting these values into the equation for Qr, we get:

Qr = (0.01)(0.899)2(0.002)2 / (1)(1)2 = 6.38 × 10-11

Since the reaction is non-spontaneous in the forward direction, we need to calculate the minimum voltage required to make it spontaneous. We can use the Nernst equation in reverse:

E = -E° + (RT / nF) ln(1/Qr)

Substituting the values we have:

E = -(-0.251) + (8.314 × 300 / 96490) ln(1/6.38 × 10-11)

$E°_{cell} = E°_{Fe^{2+}/Fe} - E°_{Zn^{2+}/Zn}$

$E°_{cell} = (-0.44 V) - (-0.76 V)$

$E_{cell} = E°_{cell} - (RT/nF)ln(Q)$

where $Q$ is the reaction quotient.

We know that the cell discharges spontaneously, so $Q$ is greater than 1. Let's assume that the number of electrons involved in the reaction is 2 ($n=2$).

$E_{cell} = 0.32 V - (8.314 J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1} \times 298 K / 2 \times 96500 C.mol^{-1})ln(Q)$

$E_{cell} = 0.32 V - (4.51 \times 10^{-3} J/C)ln(Q)$

$ln(Q) = (0.32 V + 4.51 \times 10^{-3} J/C) / (4.51 \times 10^{-3} J/C)$

$ln(Q) \approx 1.11$

$Q \approx e^{1.11} \approx 3.02$

Now, let's calculate the concentration ratio:

$K_c = \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]}$

$E_{cell} = E°_{cell} - (RT/nF)ln(K_c)$

$0.5 V = 0.32 V - (8.314 J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1} \times 298 K / 2 \times 96500 C.mol^{-1})ln(K_c)$

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and F is Faraday's constant.

Assuming T = 25°C (298.15 K), we have:
R = 8.314 J/mol*K
F = 96,485 C/mol
n = 3

We also need to find the reaction quotient Q:
Q = [Fe(III)]/[Fe]^3

We don't have a value for [Fe(III)], but we can assume that it is much smaller than [Fe], so we can be approximated as 0. We can also assume that the activity coefficients are close to 1, so we can use the concentrations directly.

i0 = i0* exp(-0.5001 V / 0.06 V)
i0 = i0* exp(-83.35)

i = i0* exp(0.06 V * |-0.5001 V|)
i = 1.35*10^-13 A/cm^2 * exp(0.06 V * 0.5001 V)
i = 1.35*10^-13 A/cm^2 * exp(0.03566 V)

Work hardening (Q) is a process that increases the strength of a material by deforming it, leading to an increase in the density of dislocations.

However, in general, Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) tends to have a wider heat-affected zone compared to Laser Beam Welding (LBW) and Metal Inert Gas Welding (MIG). Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P > Q > R.

Explanation:

Laser Beam Welding (LBW) is a welding process that utilizes a high-power concentrated laser beam to melt thin or thick metal interfaces for high strength joints. The heat input is very localized, and the heat-affected zone is relatively small due to the high energy density of the laser beam.

Metal Inert Gas Welding (MIG) is a welding process that uses a consumable wire electrode and an inert gas shield to protect the weld pool from atmospheric contamination. The heat input is moderate, and the heat-affected zone is larger than that of LBW but smaller than that of Submerged Arc Welding (SAW).

Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) is a welding process that uses a bare metal electrode that is submerged in a bed of flux. The arc produced melts the electrode and the surrounding flux, which is then deposited into the weld pool. The heat input is high, and the heat-affected zone is larger than that of MIG and LBW due to the larger volume of material being melted and the longer heating time.

Therefore, the width of the heat-affected zone in decreasing order is: P (SAW) > Q (MIG) > R (LBW).",,,0,

4. Calculate the volume of the powder added to the die:
Volume of powder = Mass of powder / Density of powder

5. Find the fill height:
Fill height = Volume of powder / Area of cross-section

Now, we need to find the diameter of the compact. Since the compact is cylindrical, its diameter is equal to its height multiplied by 2.

D = 12 mm × 2 = 24 mm

Now, we can calculate the fill height:

Fill height = Volume of powder / (π(D/2)²)

Plugging in the values, we get:

The process involves melting the metal by passing a direct current through the electrode and the workpiece, which creates an electric arc. The slag is added to the weld pool to protect it from atmospheric gases and to help remove impurities. The slag also forms a layer on the surface of the weld pool, which helps to insulate it and maintain a stable arc. Due to the use of slag and the larger size of the weld pool, Electro Slag Welding is not suitable for joining thin metal sheets.",,,0,
Material processing,22,G-META-18-16,MCQS,31,Which of the following categories of materials is suitable as a filler for brazing of steel sheets?  (A) Epoxy resins (B) Near-eutectic alloys (C) Refractory alloys (D) Large freezing range alloys,"The correct answer is (B) Near-eutectic alloys.

Explanation:

Brazing is a joining process that uses a filler metal to melt and flow into the gap between two metal surfaces, forming a strong bond. For brazing of steel sheets, it is important to use a filler metal with good wettability and fluidity on the steel surfaces, as well as a melting point lower than that of the base metal to avoid melting the base metal.

Near-eutectic alloys are suitable for brazing of steel sheets because they have a low melting point due to their eutectic composition, and they exhibit good wettability and fluidity on steel surfaces. Epoxy resins are not suitable as brazing fillers because they are organic materials and cannot melt and flow like metals. Refractory alloys have high melting points and are not suitable for brazing because they would melt the base metal. Large freezing range alloys have a wide range of melting temperatures and may not provide consistent results in brazing.",,,0,

1. Sand casting: The use of sand molds results in a rougher surface finish compared to other casting processes.
2. Permanent mold casting: Permanent molds provide a smoother surface finish compared to sand casting due to the use of metal molds.
3. Pressure die casting: Pressure die casting uses metal dies and high pressure to force the molten metal into the mold, resulting in a very smooth surface finish.
4. Investment casting: Investment casting uses a wax or ceramic shell as the mold, which provides an extremely smooth surface finish due to the absence of any rough sand particles.

Explanation:

Alligatoring is a type of defect commonly observed in deep drawing processes, where the surface of the drawn part develops a rough, wavy appearance, resembling the skin of an alligator. This defect is caused by the uneven distribution of plastic deformation during the drawing process, which results in the formation of ridges and valleys on the surface of the part. The defect can lead to reduced strength and dimensional accuracy of the part, and can also affect its aesthetic appearance. Therefore, the correct answer is [B, ""Deep drawing""].",,,0,

If the heat transfer efficiency is 0.6, the energy input per unit length (in 𝐽. $𝑚𝑚^(−1)$ , rounded off to the nearest integer) during the process is","To calculate the energy input per unit length during the arc welding process, we need to use the following formula:

E = I²A/(ηh)

where:
I = current = 400 A
A = welding area = (traverse speed) x (electrode cross-sectional area)
η = heat transfer efficiency = 0.6
h = enthalpy of fusion of the material

First, let's calculate the welding area:

A = 5 𝑚𝑠^(−1) x π(d/2)²
where d is the electrode diameter.

Assuming a typical electrode diameter of 1.6 mm, we have:

A = 5 𝑚^(−1) x π(1.6 mm/2)² = 0.0113 𝑚𝑚

Now, we can calculate the energy input per unit length:

E = I²A/(ηh) = (400 A)² x 0.0113 𝑚𝑚 / (0.6 x h)

To find the value of h, we need to know the specific heat capacity and melting point of the material being welded. Let's assume it's steel with a melting point of 1538°C and a specific heat capacity of 0.47 J/g°C.

h = ΔHf + ΔHv
where ΔHf is the heat of fusion and ΔHv is the specific heat capacity x temperature change.

For steel's melting point, ΔHf = 241.8 kJ/kg.

ΔHv = 0.47 J/g°C x (1538°C - 25°C) x 1 kg/1000 kg = 685.3 J/kg°C

h = 241.8 kJ/kg + 685.3 J/kg°C = 242.48 kJ/kg

Now, we can calculate the energy input per unit length:

E = (400 A)² x 0.0113 𝑚𝑚 / (0.6 x 242.48 kJ/kg) = 11.5 kJ/m

So, the energy input per unit length during the arc welding process is approximately 11.5 kJ/m.",,,0,

Explanation:

The text states that heavily cold-worked metals recrystallize faster and at lower temperatures than less deformed metals. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because a coarser recrystallized grain size is typically associated with less deformation or lower temperatures during recrystallization.

Option B is incorrect because a lower driving force for recrystallization would result in a slower recrystallization rate, not a faster one.

Option C is incorrect because a lower energy barrier for nucleation would actually make it easier for recrystallized grains to form, not harder.

1. Calculate the mass fractions of Ni in each plate and the filler rod:

Fe-10 wt.% Ni: ωNi1 = 10/100 = 0.1
Fe-20 wt.% Cr-5 wt.% Ni: ωNi2 = 5/100 = 0.05
Filler rod: ωNi3 = 20/100 = 0.2

2. Determine the total mass fraction of Ni in the weld pool:

Contribution from the filler rod: ωNi_filler = 0.2

Total mass fraction of Ni in the weld pool: ωNi_weld = ωNi_total_plate + ωNi_filler = 0.012 + 0.2 = 0.212

Energy input per unit length = Power of welding machine / Travel speed

Next, we can use the heat balance equation to find the width of the weld pool at the melting point:

Mass of metal melted per unit length = Energy input per unit length / Heat of fusion
= 500 W/mm / 6 J/mm^3
= 83.33 g/mm

Let w be the width of the weld pool at the melting point. Then, the volume of the molten metal is given by:

Volume of molten metal = Mass of metal melted per unit length * Width of weld pool
= 83.33 g/mm * w mm

Using the melting factor and heat transfer factor, we can write the heat balance equation as:

Volume of molten metal = Volume of heat input / (Heat transfer factor * Melting factor)

Volume of heat input = Power of welding machine * Travel time per unit length
= 3000 W * (w / 6 mm/s)

Setting these two expressions for the volume of molten metal equal to each other and solving for w, we get:

w = (3000 W * 6 mm/s) / (83.33 g/mm * 0.5 * 0.6)
w ≈ 12.5 mm

Finally, the cross-sectional area of the weld is given by:

Cross-sectional area = Width of weld * Travel speed

= 75 mm^2

So, the cross-sectional area of the continuous fillet weld is approximately 75 mm^2.",,,0,

Find the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$,"To find the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient of copper in aluminium is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$, we can use the Arrhenius equation for diffusion coefficient:

$D = D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{kT}\right)$

where $D_0$ is the frequency factor, $Q$ is the activation energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given the values of $D$ at two temperatures, so we can set up two equations and solve for $Q$ and $D_0$.

From the given data, we have:

$D_{400K} = 1.28 \times 10^{-22}$ $m^2s^(-1)$
$D_{500K} = 5.75 \times 10^{-19}$ $m^2s^(-1)$

We want to find the temperature $T$ such that $D = 10^{-16}$ $m^2s^(-1)$. So, we set up the following equation:

$10^{-16} = D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{kT}\right)$

To find $Q$ and $D_0$, we can use the given data to set up another equation:

$\ln\left(\frac{D_{500K}}{D_{400K}}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{5.75 \times 10^{-19}}{1.28 \times 10^{-22}}\right) = \ln\left(4.52 \times 10^3\right) = 3.95$

Using the Arrhenius equation, we have:

$3.95 = \ln\left(\frac{D_{500K}}{D_{400K}}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{kT_{500K}}\right)}{D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{kT_{400K}}\right)}\right)$

$3.95 = \ln\left(\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{Q}{kT_{500K}}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{Q}{kT_{400K}}\right)}\right)$

$3.95 = -\frac{Q}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_{500K}} - \frac{1}{T_{400K}}\right)$

Solving for $Q$, we get:

$Q = \frac{3.95 \times k \times (T_{400K} + T_{500K})}{2}$

Substituting the given temperatures in Kelvin, we have:

$T_{400K} = 400 + 273.15 = 673.15 K$
$T_{500K} = 500 + 273.15 = 773.15 K$

$Q = \frac{3.95 \times 8.61733262 \times 10^{-5} \times (673.15 + 773.15)}{2}$

Now, we can find the temperature $T$ by solving the following equation:

$10^{-16} = D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{1.11 \times 10^{-18}}{kT}\right)$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

$\ln(10^{-16}) = \ln(D_0) - \frac{1.11 \times 10^{-18}}{kT}$

Solving for $T$, we get:

$T = \frac{1.11 \times 10^{-18}}{k \ln(10^{-16}) + \ln(D_0)}$

First, we need to find the surface concentration of gallium in the silicon wafer. Since the surface concentration is not given directly, we can use the given information that the diffusion coefficient (D) of gallium in silicon at 1355 °C is 6×$10^(−11)$ $cm^2$ $s^(−1)$ and the solubility of gallium in silicon is about 3.7×$10^{26}$ atoms/m$^3$. We can assume that the surface concentration is equal to the solubility concentration since the wafer is in contact with gallium vapor.

The surface concentration of gallium in the silicon wafer can be calculated as:

$C_s = N_A \times \frac{1}{V} \times N_d$

where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, $V$ is the volume of the silicon wafer, and $N_d$ is the number of gallium atoms in the wafer at the solubility concentration.

$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

where $r$ is the radius of the silicon wafer.

$N_d = N_A \times C_s \times V$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$N_d = N_A \times C_s \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

$C_s = \frac{N_d}{N_A \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}$

$C_s = 1.13 \times 10^{19} \frac{1}{r^3}$

$J = -D \frac{dC}{dx}$

$J = -D \frac{C_s - C}{x}$

where $J$ is the diffusion flux, $C$ is the concentration of gallium at a depth of $10^(−3)$ cm, and $x$ is the diffusion depth.

We want the concentration of gallium at a depth of $10^(−3)$ cm to be one half the surface concentration, so:

$C = \frac{1}{2} C_s$

Substituting the values, we get:

$C = \frac{1}{2} \times 1.13 \times 10^{19} \frac{1}{r^3}$

$C = 5.65 \times 10^{10^3 \frac{1}{r^3}}$

Nickel corrodes at 298 K in a solution of 0.06 M nickel chloride having pH 4. Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer)","To find the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel, we need to use the Nernst equation and the Legendre transformation.

First, let's calculate the standard reduction potential of nickel in the given solution. The standard reduction potential of nickel in the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is given as −0.25 V. However, in the given solution, we have nickel ions and hydrogen ions present. We need to calculate the reduction potential of nickel in this solution.

The reduction potential of nickel in the given solution can be calculated using the Nernst equation:

E = E° + (RT/nF)ln(aNi2+/aNi)

where E° is the standard reduction potential of nickel, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and aNi2+ and aNi are the activities of nickel ions in the solution.

Since we are assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, we can assume that the activity of nickel ions is equal to its concentration, which is given as 0.06 M. The activity of hydrogen ions can be calculated using the given pH value:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

where pKa is the acid dissociation constant of nickel chloride, [A-] is the concentration of nickel ions, and [HA] is the concentration of nickel chloride.

The acid dissociation constant of nickel chloride is given as 1.3 × 10−10 M. Therefore,

pH = 1.3 × 10−10 + log(0.06)
pH = 1.15

The concentration of hydrogen ions can be calculated using the given pH value:

[H+] = 10^(-pH)
[H+] = 10^(-1.15)
[H+] = 2.5 × 10−2 M

The activity of hydrogen ions can be calculated using the activity coefficient:

aH+ = [H+]γH+

where γH+ is the activity coefficient of hydrogen ions. The value of γH+ is typically taken to be 1 in aqueous solutions. Therefore,

aH+ = 2.5 × 10−2

Now, we can calculate the reduction potential of nickel in the given solution:

E = −0.25 + (8.314 × 10^3/2 × 298)/(2 × 96500) × ln(0.06/2.5 × 10−2)
E = −0.25 + (4.007 × 10^−3)/(2 × 9.65 × 10^4) × ln(0.024)
E = −0.25 + 1.19 × 10−5 × (-1.178)
E = −0.25 + 1.37 × 10−5
E = −0.2365 V

Next, we need to calculate the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel. This can be calculated using the Legendre transformation:

ΔG = ΔH − TΔS

where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, ΔH is the enthalpy change, and ΔS is the entropy change.

The enthalpy change can be calculated using the standard enthalpy of formation of nickel and hydrogen:

ΔH = ΔHf(Ni) + ΔHf(H2) − ΔHf(NiCl2) − ΔHf(HCl)

where ΔHf(Ni) is the standard enthalting of formation of nickel, ΔHf(H2) is the standard enthalpy of formation of hydrogen, ΔHf(NiCl2) is the standard enthalpy of formation of nickel chloride, and ΔHf(HCl) is the standard enthalpy of formation of hydrogen chloride.

The standard enthalpy of formation of nickel, hydrogen, nickel chloride, and hydrogen chloride are given as −285",,,0,
Transport phenomena,7,G-XEC-2020-22,NUM,74,Given: Diffusivity of carbon in iron at 1100 °C is 6.0* $10^(-11)m^(2).s^(-1) and erf(z) from the image. A plain carbon steel sample containing 0.1 wt% carbon is undergoing carburization at 1100 ° C in a carbon rich surroundings with fixed carbon content of 1.0 wt% all the time. The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer). ,"To calculate the carburization time, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion and the given data. First, we need to convert the weight percent carbon to mol/cm^3.

0.1 wt% carbon = 0.0001 mol/cm^3

Next, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion to find the concentration gradient and the diffusion flux:

∂C/∂x = -(Cs - Cb) / (πDt)
Jx = -D(Cs - Cb) / √πDt)

where Cs is the surface concentration (1.0 wt% = 1.106*$10^-2 mol/cm^3), Cb is the bulk concentration (0.0001 mol/cm^3), D is the diffusivity (6.0*$10^-11 m^2.s^-1), and x is the depth (5 mm = 5*$10^-3 m).

Substituting the given values, we get:

∂C/∂x = -(1.106*$10^-2 - 0.0001) / (π * 6.0*$10^-11 * t)
Jx = -6.0*$10^-11 * (1.106*$10^-2 - 0.0001) / (√π * t)

We want to find the time t when C = 0.46 wt% (or 5.37*$10^-3 mol/cm^3). We can set up the equation:

5.37*$10^-3 = 0.0001 + (1.106*$10^-2 - 0.0001) * erf(z)

Solving for z, we get:

z = erf^-1((5.37*$10^-3 - 0.0001) / (1.106*$10^-2 - 0.0001))

Now we can find the time t:

t = (z^2 * π * 6.0*$10^-11) ^ (-1)

Using a calculator, we find:

z = 1.12
t = 1.12^2 * π * 6.0*$10^-11 = 7.3*$10^-8 s

Converting hours:

t = 7.3*$10^-8 s / (3600 s/h) = 0.0000202 hours

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is 0 hours.

However, this result is not physically meaningful, as it suggests that the carbon concentration reaches the desired value instantaneously. This may be due to the simplifying assumptions made in the Fick's second law model, such as constant properties and infinite diffusivity in the bulk. In practice, the carburization process may involve complex boundary conditions and variable properties, requiring numerical solutions and more sophisticated models.",,,0,
Transport phenomena,8,G-XEC-2021-22,NUM,64,"When a metal (M) is immersed in de-aerated acid electrolyte, it polarizes anodically by 0.4 V. The $M/M^(n+)$ exchange current density is $10^(−5)$ A $m^(−2)$ and Tafel slope is 0.1 V/decade for the anodic reaction. Assume that corrosion is uniform and, anodic and cathodic reactions are under activation control. The rate of metal dissolution in A $m^(−2)$ is? (round off to 1 decimal place)  ","To calculate the rate of metal dissolution, we can use the Tafel equation:

i = i0 exp(βlog(η + Ea/nF))

where i is the current density, i0 is the exchange current density, β is the Tafel slope, η is the overpotential, and Ea, and n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction.

First, we need to find the overpotential η:

η = Epol - Ecorr

where Epol is the polarization potential (0.4 V) and Ecorr is the corrosion potential (given in the problem as 0 V).

η = 0.4 V

Next, we can calculate the current density i:

i = i0 exp(βlog(η + Ea/nF))

We are given i0 and β, so we can solve for i:

i = 10^(-5) A m^(-2) exp(0.1 V/decade log(0.4 V + Ea/nF))

To find Ea, we can use the Nernst equation:

E = E0 + (RT/nF)ln(aM/aM^(n+))

where E0 is the standard potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred, and aM and aM^(n+) are the activities of M and M^(n+), respectively.

Since we are assuming de-aerated conditions, the activities of M and M^(n+) are equal to their unit activity (1 M).

E = E0

We are not given the standard potential E0 for the reaction M → M^(n+) + ne^-, but we can use the half-cell potentials given in the problem to find it. The half-cell potential for the reaction M → M^(n+) + ne^- is the potential of the M electrode relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

The potential of the SHE is given as 0 V. The potential of the M electrode is given as 0.4 V.

Therefore, the standard potential E0 for the reaction M → M^(n+) + ne^- is 0.4 V.

Now we can calculate the overpotential η:

η = Epol - Ecorr = 0.4 V - 0 V = 0.4 V

Next, we can calculate the current density i:

i = 10^(-5) A m^(-2) exp(0.1 V/decade log(0.4 V + Ea/nF))

We are given n = 1, so we can simplify the equation:

i = 10^(-5) A m^(-2) exp(0.1 V/decade log(0.4 V + Ea))

To find Ea, we can use the Nernst equation:

E = E0 + (RT/F)ln(aM/aM^(n+)

Since we are assuming unit activity for both M and M^(n+), we can simplify the equation:

E = E0

Therefore, Ea = E - E0 = 0.4 V - E0

We are not given the value of E0, but we can use the Tafel equation to find it indirectly.

i = i0 exp(βlog(η + Ea/nF))

We can rearrange the equation to solve for Ea:

Ea = ηln(i/i0) - βln(10)

We are given i = ? A m^(-2), and we can find i0 from the exchange current density:

i0 = 10^(-5) A m^(-2)

Substituting these values into the equation for Ea:

Ea = 0.4 V ln(?/10^(-5)) - 0.1 V

We cannot calculate the exact value of Ea without knowing the value of ?, but we can calculate the rate of metal dissolution using the current density i and the Tafel equation:

i = i0 exp(βlog(η + Ea/nF))

We can rearrange the equation to solve for the rate of metal dissolution:

"," To find the time it takes for component A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 600 K, we can use the given equation for diffusivity and the relationship between diffusivity and time for a given depth.

First, we need to find the diffusivity at 600 K:

$D_A(600K) = (D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_B(600K)})$

We know that $k_B$ is a constant, so we can calculate the exponent:

${E_a/k_B(600K)} = {0.3eV / (8.62*10^{-5}eV/K * 600K)}$

Now, we can calculate the diffusivity:

$D_A(600K) = (D_A)°*exp(-{0.3eV / (8.62*10^{-5}eV/K * 600K)})$

Next, we need to find the time it takes for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 600 K. We can use the relationship between diffusivity, time, and depth:

$x^2 = 2*D_A*t$

We know that $x = 10 μm = 10^-4 m$, so we can solve for time:

$t = x^2 / (2*D_A)$

$x_H = \sqrt{\frac{P_{H_2}}{P_0}}$

where $x_H$ is the mole fraction of hydrogen in the solution, $P_{H_2}$ is the partial pressure of hydrogen, and $P_0$ is the standard pressure (1 atm).

First, we need to find the mole fraction of hydrogen at $P_{H_2}$ = 1 atm:

$x_{H,1} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1}} = 1$

Then, we can use Sievert's law to find the mole fraction of hydrogen at $P_{H_2}$ = 0.09 atm:

$x_{H,2} = \sqrt{\frac{0.09}{1}} = 0.3$

Next, we need to convert the mole fraction to volume units (STP $mm^3$ per kg of Pd):

$V_{H,2} = x_{H,2} \times V_{m,Pd} \times MW_{H}$

where $V_{m,Pd}$ is the molar volume of Pd (24.14 $cm^3$/mol), and $MW_{H}$ is the molecular weight of hydrogen (2.016 $g/mol$).

A copper-aluminium diffusion couple develops a certain concentration profile after an isothermal treatment at 600°C for 10 hours. The time(in hours to 1 decimal place) required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is,"To find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C, we can use the relationship between the interdiffusion coefficient and the diffusion coefficient:

D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)

where D is the diffusion coefficient, D0 is the pre-exponential factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

Since we are given the interdiffusion coefficients at two temperatures, we can find the ratio of the diffusion coefficients:

D(600°C) / D(500°C) = [D0 exp(-Q/RT(600°C))] / [D0 exp(-Q/RT(500°C))]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:

ln[D(600°C) / D(500°C)] = ln[exp(-Q/RT(600°C))] - ln[exp(-Q/RT(500°C))]

Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify this expression to:

ln[D(600°C) / D(500°C)] = -[Q/R][1/(T(600°C)) - 1/(T(500°C))]

Now, we can use this relationship to find the time ratio:

t(500°C) / t(600°C) = [D(500°C)]^2 / [D(600°C)]^2

t(500°C) / t(600°C) = [8 * 10^(-13) m^(2)s^(-1)]^2 / [4 * 10^(-14) m^(2)s^(-1)]^2

Calculating the ratio, we find:

t(500°C) / t(600°C) = 16

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is 16 times longer than the time at 600°C:

t(500°C) = 16 * 10 hours = 160 hours (approximately)

If 200g of weight is lost over a period of 10 years, then the corrosion rate($kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$) is?(round off to the nearest integer)","The corrosion rate can be calculated using the given equation: CPR = KW/pAt, where W is the weight loss per unit time, t is the time, p is the density of the metal, and A is the exposed surface area.

Given: W = 200g, t = 10 years, p = 7850 kg/m^3 (for iron), A = 50 cm^2 = 0.05 m^2

First, convert the weight loss to kg: W = 200g = 0.2 kg

Now, calculate the corrosion rate: PR = K(0.2 kg)/(0.05 m^2)(7850 kg/m^3)(10 years) = K(0.0157 kg/m^2.year)

The value of K for corrosion penetration rate in mils per year is 534. To convert it to kg.m^2.year^(-1), divide it by 25.81 (conversion factor): K = 534/25.81 = 20.55 kg.m^2.year^(-1)

Assuming $𝑎_1$ = $𝑎_2$ = 1, the magnitude of flux at 𝑥 = 2 mm is y * $10^(-3)atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1)$. Find value of y.(answer rounded off to the nearest integer).","To find the value of y, we need to use Fick's first law of diffusion, which states that the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient. The concentration gradient can be found by taking the derivative of the given expression for C with respect to x.

First, let's find the derivative of C with respect to x:

dC/dx = 2a₁x + a₂

Now, we can use Fick's first law to find the flux:

Jx = -D(dC/dx)

Substituting the expression for dC/dx and the given value of D:

Jx = -3 * 10^(-3) * (2a₁x + a₂)
)

We are given that the flux at x = 2 mm is y * 10^(-3) atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1). So, we can set up the equation:

y * 10^(-3) = -3 * 10^(-3) * (2a₁(2) + a₂)

Solving for a₂:

a₂ = -y * 10^(-3) + 2a₁(2)

Since we are given that e₁ = e₂, we can set a₁ = e₂/2:

a₂ = -y * 10^(-3) + 2(e₂/2)²

Simplifying:

a₂ = -y * 10^(-3) + e₂²

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since the units of y are atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1) and the units of e₂ are atoms.mm^(-5), we need to make sure that the units of y and e₂ are consistent when we compare their values.

To do this end, let's assume that e₂ = 1. Then, we have:

a₂ = -y * 10^(-3) + 1

We don't have enough information to determine the exact value of y, but we can find the range of possible values by considering the physical significance of the concentration gradient.

The concentration gradient (dC/dx) should be positive for diffusion to occur, so we need to make sure that 2a₁x + a₂ is positive for x > 0. If we set x = 2 and solve for the minimum value of a₂ that satisfies this condition, we get:

a₂ > -2a₁(2) + 1

Since a₁ = e₂/2, we have:

a₂ > -2(e₂/2)² + 1

Squaring both sides:

a₂² > 4e₂²/4 - 2e₂²/4 + 1

a₂² > e₂²/2 + 1/4

Taking the square root:

|a₂| > √(e₂²/2 + 1/4)

Since a₂ is negative, the actual value of a₂ should be smaller than this. Therefore, the minimum value of y that satisfies the condition is:

y < √(e₂²/2 + 1/4)

To find the exact value of y, we would need to know the value of e₂. Without this information, we can only determine that the value of y is less than √(e₂²/2 + 1/4).

Therefore, the answer is: y < √(e₂²/2 + 1/4) (rounded off to the nearest integer, since y is not given as an integer value)",,,0,

The electric current(in amperes) required to generate the necessary magnetic field is?  (round off to 1 decimal place)," To demagnetize the iron bar magnet, we need to apply a magnetic field opposite to the magnetization direction of the magnet. The coercivity of the magnet is given as 7000 A/m.

First, let's calculate the magnetic moment of the magnet:

Magnetic moment (M) = Coercivity (Hc) × Volume (V)

Assuming the volume of the magnet is 10 cm × 5 cm × 10 cm = 500 cm³, we have:

M = 7000 A/m × 500 cm³ = 3.5 × 10⁶ J/T

Now, let's calculate the magnetic field strength (H) required to demagnetize the magnet:

H = M / (μ₀ × V)

Using the given value of the magnetic moment and the permeability of free space (μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), we have:

H = 3.5 × 10⁶ J/T / (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A × 0.05 m³) = 1.6 × 10⁵ A/m

Next, we need to calculate the current required to generate this magnetic field using the solenoid. The magnetic field inside the solenoid is given by:

B = μ₀ × N × I / (l × A)

where N is the number of turns, l is the length of the solenoid, and A is the cross-sectional area.

Since the magnetic field is approximately uniform inside the solenoid, we can assume that the magnetic field strength (H) is equal to the magnetic field density (B) inside the solenoid. Therefore, we have:

B = H = 1.6 × 10⁵ A/m

Now, we can calculate the current required to generate this magnetic field:

I = B × A / (μ₀ × N)

Assuming the cross-sectional area of the solenoid is 1 cm² and the length is 0.25 m, we have:

I = 1.6 × 10⁵ A/m × 1 cm² / (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A × 150) = 1.7 × 10² A

For bcc iron, the magnetic moment per atom is 2.22 μB and the density is 7.87 g/cm³. Using these values, we can calculate the number of atoms per unit volume as N = ρ/M, where ρ is the density and M is the atomic mass. Therefore, N = 7.87 g/cm³ / 55.85 g/mol = 0.142 g/cm³ / 55.85 g/mol = 2.55 * 10^28 m³/mol. The number of magnetic moments per unit volume is then Nmag = N * 2 * μB^2, where μB = 9.27 * 10^-24 J/T. Therefore, Nmag = 2.55 * 10^28 m³/mol * 2 * (9.27 * 10^-24 J/T)^2 = 1.66 * 10^26 J/T^2. Using the conversion factor 1 J/T = 1 C/m^2, we can convert this to A/m as Msat = Nmag * μB = 1.66 * 10^26 J/T^2 * 9.27 * 10^-24 J/T = 1.53 * 10^6 A/m.

M = N × statistical average of the magnetic moment component per atom along H

We know that M = 600 kA/m, and we need to find the magnetic moment per atom (μB) in Bohr magnetons. First, let's find the number of magnetic moments per unit volume (N):

N = M / (μB × volume per unit cell)

The volume per unit cell for an FCC lattice is given by:

a³ = (4/3)πr³

We are given the lattice parameter (a = 0.2 nm = 0.0002 nm), so we can calculate the volume per unit cell:

a³ = (4/3)π(0.0002 nm)³ = 0.000524 nm³

Now we can find the number of magnetic moments per unit volume:

N = 600 kA/m / (μB × 0.000524 nm³)

We are given that μB = 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T, so we can convert the saturation magnetization to Tesla:

M = 600 kA/m × 10^-4 m/A × 10^-3 T/kA = 6.0 × 10^4 T

Now we can find the number of magnetic moments per unit volume:

N = 6.0 × 10^4 T / (9.27 × 10^-24 J/T × 0.000524 nm³) = 1.11 × 10^29 1/m³

Since there is one atom in the unit cell, the number of magnetic moments per atom is equal to the number of magnetic moments per unit volume:

Magnetic moment per atom = N = 1.11 × 10^29 1/m³

To find the magnetic moment per atom in Bohr magnetons, we need to convert the number density to magnetic moment density and then divide by the number of atoms per unit cell:

Magnetic moment density = N × μB = 1.11 × 10^29 1/m³ × 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T = 1.02 × 10^6 J/m³

Magnetic moment per atom = Magnetic moment density / number of atoms per unit cell = 1.02 × 10^6 J/m³ / 1 = 1.02 × 10^6 J/m³

To convert J/m³ to Bohr magnetons, we use the conversion factor:

1 Bohr magneton = 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T

Magnetic moment per atom = 1.02 × 10^6 J/m³ / (9.27 × 10^-24 J/T) = 1.1 × 10^28 Bohr magnetons/m³ / 1 m³/atom = 1.1 × 10^28 Bohr magnetons/atom

Since we are looking for the magnetic moment per atom in Bohr magnetons, we can simplify the answer to:

Magnetic moment per atom = 1.1 × 10^28 Bohr magnetons/atom

However, the answer choices do not match this value exactly. The closest answer is (B) 2.02 × 10^(57) Bohr magnetons/atom, which is an order of magnitude off.

Ms = N × μB × M

where N is the number of Fe atoms per unit volume, μB is the magnetic moment per Fe atom, and M is the saturation magnetization per unit volume.

First, we need to find the number of Fe atoms per unit volume. We know that the lattice parameter of BCC iron is 0.287 nm, so the volume of the unit cell is:

a³ = (0.287 nm)³ = 0.023 55 nm³

The number of Fe atoms in the unit cell is 2 (since there are 2 atoms in a BCC unit cell), so the number of Fe atoms per unit volume is:

N = 1/a³ = 1/(0.023 55 nm³) = 4.24 × $10^{28}$ m⁻³

Now we can calculate the saturation magnetization:

Ms = N × μB × M

We are given that the net magnetic moment of an Fe atom is 2 𝜇𝐵, so the magnetic moment per Fe atom is:

μB = 2 𝜇𝐵 = 2 × 9.273 × $10^(-24)$ A $m^2$ = 1.8546 × $10^(-23)$ J T⁻¹

The saturation magnetization per unit volume is not given, so we need to assume a value for it. Let's assume that it is the same as that of pure BCC iron, which is approximately 1.752 kAm⁻¹ [1].

M = ?

Now we can calculate the saturation magnetization:

Ms = N × μB × M
Ms = 4.24 × $10^{28}$ m⁻³ × 1.8546 × $10^(-23)$ J T⁻¹ × M
Ms = 7.93 × $10^5$ J T⁻¹ × M
Ms = 7.93 × $10^5$ kAm⁻¹ × M

To find the saturation magnetization in kAm⁻¹, we need to convert J T⁻¹ to kAm⁻¹:

1 J T⁻¹ = 10³ kAm⁻¹

So:

Ms = 7.93 × $10^5$ kAm⁻¹ × M
Ms = 7.93 × $10^5$ kAm⁻¹ × ?

We don't know the value of M, but we can round off the other values to one decimal place:

Ms = 7.9 × $10^5$ kAm⁻¹

Therefore, the saturation magnetization of Fe in kAm⁻¹, rounded off to one decimal place, is approximately 7.9 × $10^5$ kAm⁻¹.

The saturation magnetization is given as 1700 $kAm^(-1)$, and the volume of the unit cell is given by the lattice parameter $a = 0.287$ nm.

First, we need to convert the saturation magnetization to magnetic moment per unit volume. We know that $1$ $kA/m = 10^4$ $Am^(-1)$, so:

$M_s = 1700 \times 10^3 \times 10^4 = 17 \times 10^11 \ Am^(-1)$

Next, we can find the magnetic moment per unit volume by dividing the saturation magnetization by the volume of the unit cell:

$M = \frac{M_s}{N_A \times V} = \frac{17 \times 10^{11}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \times (0.287 \times 10^{-9})^3} = 2.2 \times 10^{-23} \ J/T$

Since we want the magnetic moment per iron atom, we need to divide the magnetic moment per unit volume by the number of iron atoms per unit cell. We assume that iron has a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, so there are 4 iron atoms in the unit cell. Therefore:

$m = \frac{M}{N_A \times N_{Fe}} = \frac{2.2 \times 10^{-23}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 4} = x \times 10^{-23}$

Secondary electrons (P) are low-energy electrons that are emitted from the sample surface when it is bombarded with high-energy electrons. They are used for topographic imaging and provide information about the sample surface morphology.

Backscattered electrons (Q) are high-energy electrons that are ejected from the sample when the incident electron beam strikes the atoms in the sample. They are used for compositional analysis and elemental mapping since their intensity is proportional to the atomic number of the elements in the sample.

Characteristic X-X-rays (R) are produced when an electron beam interacts with the inner electrons of an atom, causing them to be ejected. The energy of the characteristic X-rays is specific to each element and can be used for chemical analysis.

Diffracted backscattered electrons (S) are electrons that are diffracted by the crystal lattice of the sample when the incident electron beam interacts with it at a specific angle. They are used for crystallographic orientation analysis and can provide information about the crystal structure of the sample.

Therefore, secondary electrons (P) are used for topographic imaging (1), backscattered electrons (Q) are used for compositional analysis (3), characteristic X-rays (R) are used for chemical analysis (4), and diffracted backscattered electrons (S) are used for crystallographic orientation analysis (1).

Explanation:

A scanning electron microscope uses an electron beam to image and analyze specimens. The interactions between the electrons and the specimen can produce different kinds of signals, including secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE). While SEs are useful for identifying, probing, and observing the deformation of fine surface features, BSEs are obtained when the incident electrons are backscattered from the sample. However, for quantitative elemental analysis, X-rays are used. When an electron beam hits the sample, it can knock electrons out of the inner shells of atoms, creating vacancies.

The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball.

For a quiescent liquid, the velocity of the sphere is zero, so the drag force exerted on the sphere is equal to the buoyant force (FB) which is given by FB = ρVg, where ρ is the density of the liquid, V is the volume of the sphere, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

For the given problem, the density of the steel ball is 7200 kg/$m^(3)$ and the density of the liquid Al is 2360 kg/$m^(3)$. The radius of the steel ball is not given directly, but it can be calculated from the given density and volume. The volume of the steel ball can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)πR^3, where R is the radius of the sphere.

First, we need to find the volume of the steel ball:

V = (4/3)πR^3

We know that the density of the steel ball is 7200 kg/$m^(3)$, so:

ρs = 7200 kg/$m^(3)$

The density of the liquid Al is 2360 kg/$m^(3)$, so:

ρl = 2360 kg/$m^(3)$

To find the volume of the steel ball, we need to solve for R:

V = (4/3)πR^3

7200 = (4/3)πR^3

R^3 = (7200 × 3)/(4 × π)

R^3 = 1.316 × 10^6 m^3

R = 1.06 × 10^2 m = 0.106 m

Now that we have the radius of the steel ball, we can calculate the volume:

V = (4/3)πR^3 = (4/3)π(0.106)^3 = 0.000419 m^3

The buoyant force on the steel ball is:

FB = ρlVg = 2360 × 1000 × 9.81 × 0.000419 = 9.81 × 0.00419 N



The drag force on the steel ball can be calculated using Stokes' law:

FD = 3πμvd = 3 × 3.14 × 1.0^-3 × 0.106^2 × 0.05^2 = 1.97 × 10^-6 N

For equilibrium, the force exerted on the steel ball is equal to the sum of the buoyant and drag forces:

F = FB + FD = 9.81 × 0.00419 + 1.0.000197 = 9.83 × 10^-3 N

The friction factor (f) is given as 0.2, so the force exerted on the steel ball can be calculated as:

F = f π R^2 (ρl v^2 /2)

Solving for v:

v = √(2F / (f π R^2 ρl))

Substituting the given values:

v = √(2 × 9.83 × 10^-3 / (0.2 × 3.14 × (0.106)^2 × 2360))

v = 0.0115 m/s

Now that we have the velocity of the liquid Al, we can calculate the terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle using Stokes' law:

Terminal velocity = 2(ρs + ρl)gR^2 / (3μ)

Substituting the given values:

Terminal velocity = 2(7200 + 2360) × 9.81 × (0.106)^2 / (3 × 1.0^-3)

At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is","To find the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle, we can use the equation for the mass flow rate through a circular nozzle:

˙m = ρAv

where ρ is the density of the liquid metal, A is the cross-sectional area of the area of the nozzle, and v is the velocity of the liquid metal at the nozzle exit.

First, we need to find the cross-sectional area of the nozzle:

A = πd²/4

where d is the diameter of the nozzle.

d = 30 mm = 0.03 m

A = π(0.03)²/4 = 0.000314 m²

Next, we need to find the velocity of the liquid metal at the nozzle exit. We can use Bernoulli's equation to find the velocity:

P1 + ρgH1 = P2 + 1/2ρv²

where P1 is the pressure at the surface of the liquid metal in the vessel, g is the acceleration due to gravity, H1 is the height of the liquid metal column, P2 is the atmospheric pressure, and v is the velocity of the liquid metal at the nozzle exit.

Since we are neglecting frictional losses, we can assume that the pressure at the surface of the liquid metal in the vessel is atmospheric (P1 = P2 = 101,325 Pa).

P1 = P2

ρgH1 = 1/2ρv²

H1 = 3.2 m

ρ = 7000 kg.$m^(-3)$

g = 9.81 m.$s^(-2)$

Solving for v:

v = √(2gh) = √(2 × 9.81 × 3.2) = 5.52 m.$s^(-1)$

Now we can find the initial mass flow rate:

˙m = ρAv = 7000 × 0.000314 × 5.52 = 15.4 kg.$s^(-1)$

However, we also need to take into account the nozzle discharge coefficient (Cd). The actual mass flow rate through the nozzle will be lower than the theoretical mass flow rate due to losses in the nozzle.

˙m\_actual = ˙m/Cd = 15.4/(0.8) = 19.25 kg.$s^(-1)$

Therefore, the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle is 19.25 kg.$s^(-1)$.",,,0,

q = -kA(dp/dz)

where q is the volumetric flow rate, k is the permeability, A is the cross-sectional area, and dp/dz is the pressure gradient.

First, we need to convert the pressure drop from mm of water to Pa:

300 mm of water = 300 × 10^3 Pa

Next, we can calculate the pressure gradient:

dp/dz = (300 × 10^3 Pa) / (length of bed)

Assuming the length of the bed is 1 meter:

dp/dz = 300 × 10^3 Pa/m

Substituting the given values, we have h = 0.5 m and g = 9.8 m.s^-2. Solving for v, we get v = sqrt(2 x 9.8 m.s^-2 x 0.5 m) = 2.236 m.s^-1.

Fluid,9,G-META-21-34,MCQS,78,"For a fully developed 1-D flow of Newtonian fluid through a horizontal pipe of radius R (see figure), the axial velocity ($v_z$) is given by: $v_z$ = [ΔP/L]*({$R^2$ - $r^2$}/4µ), where ΔP is the pressure difference (P1- P2), µ is the viscosity, r is the radial distance from the axis and L is the length of the tube. The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is:  (A) ΔPR/(2L) (B) ΔPR/L (C) 3ΔPR/(2L) (D) 2ΔPR/L","The correct answer is (B) ΔPR/L.

Explanation:

The given expression for the axial velocity $v_z$ is derived assuming a fully developed 1-D flow of Newtonian fluid through a horizontal pipe. The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is related to the velocity gradient through Newton's law of viscosity, which states that the shear stress is proportional to the partial derivative of the velocity with respect to the radial distance $r$.

By differentiating the given expression for $v_z$ with respect to $r$, we can obtain the velocity gradient and then use it to find the shear stress. The result is:

$\tau$ = µ * (∂$v_z$/∂$r$) = µ * [ΔP/L] * [1/(2$R$)] = ΔP/(2$R$)

Since the length $L$ is constant for a given pipe, we can write the shear stress as:

$\tau$ = ΔP/(2$R$) = ΔP/(2$R^2$/4) = ΔP/(2$L$)

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) ΔPR/L.",,,0,

Explanation: In an inviscid flow, the Bernoulli equation predicts that the pressure is lowest at points where the fluid velocity is highest. Since the flow is deflected around the spherical object, the velocity must be higher on each side of the central streamline OA compared to the velocity at point O. Therefore, the pressure will be lower on each side of each side of the central streamline, causing the flow to be deflected around the object.",,,0,

Ladle deoxidation of liquid steel is done at 1600°C by adding ferro-aluminium. By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?","To calculate the time required for alumina particles to float to the surface using Stokes' law, we need to find the terminal velocity of the particles and then use the equation for settling distance.

First, let's calculate the terminal velocity (v) of the alumina particles using Stokes' law:

v = (2 * g * ρp * R^2) / μ

where g is the acceleration due to gravity, ρp is the particle density, R is the particle radius, and μ is the fluid viscosity.

Given:
g = 9.81 m/s^2
ρp_alumina = 3650 kg/m^3
R = 25 µm = 0.000025 m
μ_steel = 6*$10^(-3)$ kg/m/s

Substituting these values into the equation for terminal velocity:

v = (2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 3650 kg/m^3 * (0.000025 m)^2) / (6*$10^(-3)$ kg/m/s)
v = 0.000112 m/s

Next, we'll calculate the settling distance (s) using the equation for settling velocity:

s = (v * t)

where t is the time required to settle from a depth of 2m.

We need to find the time (t) first. We can use the equation for settling distance and solve for t:

s = (1/2) * g * t^2

Given:
s = 2m = 2*10^2 m
g = 9.81 m/s^2

Solving for t:

t = sqrt((2*10^2 m) / (9.81 m/s^2))
t = 4.41 s

Now we can calculate the time required for the alumina particles to float to the surface:

s = (v * t)

Substituting the values we have calculated:

s = (0.000112 m/s * 4.41 s)
s = 0.000487 m

Since the settling distance (s) is equal to the depth (2m), we need to calculate the time required to settle half the depth (1m):

t = sqrt((1*10^2 m) / (9.81 m/s^2))
t = 2.89 s

So the time required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be approximately 2.89 seconds.",,,0,

The terminal velocity(in mm$s^(-1)$ to two decimal places) (𝑣) of a spherical inclusion of diameter D = 50 micrometers rising in liquid steel is?","To find the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion using Stokes law, we first need to calculate the drag force acting on it.

Drag force ($𝐹_𝑑$) = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣

We are given the viscosity of the liquid steel ($𝜇$) and the density of the inclusion ($\rho_s$). We need to find the diameter of the inclusion ($D$) and the density of the liquid steel ($\rho_l$).

Given data:
Density of liquid steel = 7900 kg $m^(-3)$
Viscosity of liquid steel = 0.0079 Pa s
Density of the inclusion = 2500 kg $m^(-3)$
Diameter of the inclusion = 50 micrometers = 0.00005 m

First, let's calculate the drag force:

Drag force ($𝐹_𝑑$) = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣

We need to find the terminal velocity ($𝑣$). To do this, we can rearrange the Stokes law equation:

𝑣 = ($𝐹_𝑑$ / (3𝜋𝜇))

Now, let's calculate the drag force:

Drag force ($𝐹_𝑑$) = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣

We know the viscosity and density, so we can calculate the drag force:

Drag force ($𝐹_𝑑$) = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣
= 3 × 3.14159 × 0.0079 × 9.8 × ($𝑣$)

Now, we can solve for the terminal velocity:

$𝑣$ = ($𝐹_𝑑$ / (3𝜋𝜇))
= ($3 × 3.14159 × 0.0079 × 9.8 × $𝑣$$) / (3 × 3.14159 × 0.0079)

Solving for $𝑣$:

$𝑣$ ≈ 0.00011 m/s or 0.11 mm/s

Given:
$[Fe^{3+}] = 10^{-3} M$
$K_{sp} = 10^{-39}$

We need to find the concentration of $OH^{-}$ ions. At 25°C, the concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^{+}$) in water is $10^{-7} M$. Since the pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration, we have:

$pH = -log[H^{+}] = -log(10^{-7}) = 7$
