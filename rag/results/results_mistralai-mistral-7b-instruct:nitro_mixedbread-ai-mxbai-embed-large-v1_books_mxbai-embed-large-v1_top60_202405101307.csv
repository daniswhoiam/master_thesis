Thermodynamics,1,G-XEC-2012-4,MCQS,28,Which of the following signals is produced due to the elastic scattering of electrons by a material?  (A) Secondary electron (B) Backscattered electron (C) Auger electron (D) Photoelectron," Elastic scattering of electrons by a material results in the production of electrons that retain their initial energy and direction. Therefore, the signal produced due to elastic scattering is typically the same as the incident electron beam. However, in the context of electron microscopy, the term ""elastically scattered electrons"" often refers to electrons that are scattered without losing energy and contribute to the formation of diffraction patterns and diffraction contrast images in TEM. These electrons are usually detected as the transmitted or diffracted beam. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) Backscattered electron or (C) Transmitted electron, depending on the experimental setup. However, it is important to note that the term ""elastic scattering"" can also refer to the scattering of other particles, such as neutrons or photons, and the produced signal may vary accordingly.",,,0,

(A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap (B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap (C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap (D) Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap ","The most suitable material for an LED emitting at around 380 nm is (A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap. This is because the transition probability for emission requires conservation of wavevector, and the photon wavevector is approximately zero on the scale of the Brillouin zone. In indirect-gap materials, creation or destruction of a phonon is required for band-to-band luminescence, which is less probable. The near-edge emission may correspond to luminescence from a variety of shallow energy-level structures, but it is also possible to observe deep-level luminescence from transition-metal ions and rare earths in semiconductors, provided that the electron affinities and bandgap energies are such that the pertinent energy levels fall in the band gap.

Explanation: At low injection level, the forward biasing of a p-n junction causes the depletion region to shrink, reducing the barrier height and allowing more minority carriers (holes in the n-type region and electrons in the p-type region) to be injected into the junction. These injected minority carriers diffuse into the bulk of the semiconductor and recombine with majority carriers, leading to an excess of minority carriers in the vicinity of the junction. Therefore, the minority carrier concentration is much greater than the majority carrier concentration at low injection levels.",,,0,

If 100 g of water that is at 90 °C is added to the cup, the final temperature of water in °C is","To find the final temperature of the water in °C, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The heat gained by the water is equal to the heat lost by the copper.

First, let's calculate the heat gained by the water:

m_water_initial = 80 g
m_water_final = m_initial + m_added = 80 g + 100 g = 180 g
c_water = 4.18 J/g °C
ΔT_water = final temperature - initial temperature
ΔH_water = m_water * c_water * ΔT_water

ΔH_water = 180 g * 4.18 J/g °C * (final temperature - 4 °C)

Next, let's calculate the heat lost by the copper:

m_copper = 140 g
c_copper = 0.385 J/g °C
ΔT_copper = final temperature - initial temperature
ΔH_copper = m_copper * c_copper * ΔT_copper

Since the copper and water are in thermal contact, their temperatures will eventually reach the same value. Therefore, ΔT_copper = ΔT_water.

Now, we can set the heat gained by the water equal to the heat lost by the copper:

ΔH_water = ΔH_copper

Solving for the final temperature:

ΔH_water = 180 g * 4.18 J/g °C * (final temperature - 4 °C)
ΔH_copper = 140 g * 0.385 J/g °C * (final temperature - 4 °C)

Setting them equal:

180 g * 4.18 J/g °C * (final temperature - 4 °C) = 140 g * 0.385 J/g °C * (final temperature - 4 °C)

Dividing both sides by the product of the masses and specific heats:

(final temperature - 4 °C) = (180 g * 4.18 J/g °C) / (180 g + 140 g) * (0.385 J/g °C)

(final temperature - 4 °C) = 4.18 J/g °C / 3.285 J/g °C * 0.385 J/g °C * (180 g + 140 g)

(final temperature - 4 °C) = 0.414 J/g °C * 328.5 g

(final temperature - 4 °C) = 134.53 J

Adding 4 °C to both sides:

final temperature = 138.53 °C

So, the final temperature of the water in the copper cup is 138.53 °C.",,,0,

ΔE = Rydberg constant × Rydberg factor

The Rydberg constant is 1.096776 × 10^7 m^-1, and the Rydberg factor for the transition n = 4 to n = 2 is:

Rydberg factor = (1/4^2 - 1/n1^2) - (1/4^2 - 1/n2^2)

Substituting the values, we get:

Rydberg factor = (1/16 - 1/16) - (1/16 - 1/4) = 1/4

So, the energy difference is:

ΔE = Rydberg constant × Rydberg factor = 1.096776 × 10^7 m^-1 × 1/4 = 2.794 × 10^-18 J

To convert this energy to eV, we divide by the Avogadro constant and the electronic charge:

ΔE = 2.794 × 10^-18 J / (6.022 × 10^23 electrons/mol × 1.602 × 10^-19 C) = 2.55 × 10^-6 eV = 2.55 eV

Explanation: The glass transition temperature (Tg) is a temperature at which a supercooled liquid transforms into a glassy state. It is a non-equilibrium transition, and the properties of the glass depend on its thermal history. The glassy state has a different structure and different properties compared to the crystalline state and the supercooled liquid state.

The heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient are two thermodynamic properties that change during the glass transition. Upon heating through Tg, both the heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient change. The heat capacity increases due to the increased freedom of motion of the molecules in the glassy state, while the thermal expansion coefficient decreases due to the reduced ability of the glass to expand with temperature.

Therefore, statement (D) is the correct answer. Statement (A) is incorrect because Tg appears above the melting temperature in a perfectly crystalline material. Statement (B) is incorrect because the heat capacity does not remain constant upon heating through Tg. Statement (C) is incorrect because the thermal expansion coefficient does not remain the same upon heating through Tg.",,,0,

Calculate the original length of the iron rail track in cm. (linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$)"," To find the original length of the iron rail track, we can use the given information about the change in length and the linear thermal expansion coefficient. The formula for linear thermal expansion is:

ΔL = αL × ΔT

where ΔL is the change in length, αL is the linear thermal expansion coefficient, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

We are given that ΔL = 0.05 cm and αL = 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$. We need to find L, the original length.

First, we need to find ΔT, the change in temperature. We can rearrange the linear thermal expansion formula to find ΔT:

ΔT = ΔL / (αL × L)

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔT = 0.05 cm / (11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$ × L)

To solve for L, we need to isolate L on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides by αL × L:

αL × L × ΔT = ΔL

Now, we can substitute the given value of ΔT back into the equation:

αL × L × (0.05 cm / (αL × L)) = ΔL

Simplifying the equation, we get:

L = ΔL / ΔT

Substituting the given values, we get:

L = 0.05 cm / (11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$)

Solving for L, we get:

L = 488.89 cm

Therefore, the original length of the iron rail track is approximately 488.89 cm.",,,0,
Thermodynamics,14,G-XEC-2015-65-22,NUM,32,What would be the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV. The band gap of silicon is 1.1 eV.,"To calculate the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV, we first need to determine the number of photons absorbed per unit area and time, and then the number of pairs produced per unit volume and time.

The energy of one photon is given by hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. The wavelength can be calculated from the energy using the relationship E = hc/λ.

λ = hc/E = hc/(1.54 keV) = 0.00251 nm

The number of photons absorbed per unit area and time is given by the product of the incident photon flux (I0) and the quantum efficiency (η) of the detector. The quantum efficiency is the ratio of the number of the pairs produced to the number of photons absorbed.

The number of pairs produced per unit volume and time is given by the product of the quantum efficiency, the incident photon flux, and the volume of the detector (V).

First, we need to calculate the incident photon flux (I0). The photon flux is given by the product of the intensity (I) and the area (A). The intensity is given by the power (P) divided by the area (A).

P = I0 * hc * λ

I = P/A

Substituting the given values:

P = 1.54 keV * 1.602 × 10−13 J/eV * 1.6 × 10−19 J/C * (1/1.6 × 10−19 m^2/C)^2 = 1.11 × 1012 W

A = 1 cm^2

I = P/A = 1.11 × 1012 W/1 cm^2 = 1.11 × 1013 W/m^2

Now we can calculate the number of photons absorbed per unit area and time:

η = 1 (for a perfect detector)

I0 = I * η = 1.11 × 1013 W/m^2 * 1 = 1.11 × 1013 W/m^2

Φ = I0 / hc = 1.11 × 1013 W/m^2 / (6.626 × 10−34 Js * 3 × 108 m/s) = 1.71 × 1019 photons/m^2/s

Now we can calculate the number of pairs produced per unit volume and time:

V = 1 cm^3

g = η * Φ * V = 1 * 1.71 × 1019 photons/m^2/s * 1 cm^3 = 1.71 × 1019 pairs/cm^3/s

Explanation:

The Fermi energy is defined as the energy level for which the probability of occupancy is 0.5 at absolute zero temperature. However, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the probability of occupancy for the Fermi energy is still close to 0.5 but not exactly 0.5 due to thermal excitations.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) + ln(D0) - Q/R*T2 = ln(D0) - Q/R*1300

Subtracting ln(D0) from both sides:

The zero point energy(in ev) of an electron in a box of 0.2 nm width is? (round off to 1 decimal place)"," To find the zero point energy of an electron in a box of 0.2 nm width, we can use the formula for the energy of the first excited state of a particle in a one-dimensional box and then subtract it from the energy of the ground state.

The energy of the first excited state is given by:

E1 = π²ℏ²2mL²(n = 1)² = π²ℏ²2m(1)²L² = π²ℏ²2mL²

Since the width of the box is 0.2 nm, we have:

L = 0.2 nm = 0.2 * 10^-9 m = 2 * 10^-10 m

Substituting the values of h, m, and L into the formula, we get:

E1 = π²ℏ²2m(2 * 10^-10 m)² = π²(6.63 * 10^-34 J s)²(9.11 * 10^-31 kg) / (2 * 10^-10 m)² = 1.51 * 10^-18 J

The lowest value of $T_f$( in °C) at which material will fail is?(round off to the nearest integer.). Assume that there is no plastic deformation during thermal cycling. "," To calculate the lowest value of $T_f$ at which the material will fail, we can use the equation for thermal stress (10.86a) given by $\sigma_x = \alpha x / \Delta T E$, where $\alpha x$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature, and $E$ is the modulus of elasticity.

Since the material is dimensionally constrained, the change in length $\Delta L_x$ is given by $\Delta L_x = \alpha x \Delta T L_0$, where $L_0$ is the initial length.

The maximum compressive stress $\sigma_c$ that the material can withstand is given by $\sigma_c = -200$ MPa.

We want to find the lowest value of $\Delta T$ such that $\sigma_x = \sigma_c$. Substituting the given values, we have:

$-200 \text{ MPa} = \frac{(7.5 \times 10^{-6} \degree C^{-1}) \Delta T}{(200 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa})} L_0$

Solving for $\Delta T$, we get:

$\Delta T = -\frac{200 \text{ MPa} \times 200 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}}{7.5 \times 10^{-6} \degree C^{-1} \times L_0} \approx -266.7 \times 10^6 \degree C$

Since temperature cannot be negative, this result indicates that the material will fail when the highest temperature $T_f$ during thermal cycling is above a certain value. To find this value, we need to make $\Delta T$ positive by considering the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures:

$T_f - 25 \degree C = \frac{200 \text{ MPa} \times 200 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}}{7.5 \times 10^{-6} \degree C^{-1} \times L_0}$

Solving for $T_f$, we get:

Substituting the given values:

Since the temperature Ts is given below the melting point Tm, we can assume that ΔT = Ts - Tm is negative. However, the equation requires a positive value for ΔT. To overcome this, we can use the absolute value of ΔT:

rc = 2(0.18 J.m^(-2))(Tm / (|ΔHf| * |ΔT|))

Now, we need to find the absolute values of ΔHf and ΔT. Since ΔHf is the change in enthalpy upon transformation from liquid to solid, it is equal to the latent heat of fusion ΔHf:

|ΔHf| = ΔHf = 9.50*10^8 J/m^3

The temperature difference ΔT can be calculated as:

ΔT = Ts - Tm

Since Ts is given as a temperature below the melting point Tm, ΔT is negative. However, to use it in the equation, we need to take its absolute value:

The passage explains that high surface mobility of adsorbed atoms and clusters during deposition leads to larger crystallites, and the substrate temperature is the most significant factor contributing to high mobility.

The greater the undercooling, the smaller the critical size of the solid nuclei. Therefore, for a given metal, the critical size of solid nuclei will be smaller for solidification at a lower temperature, as the undercooling is greater. In this case, the metal solidifies at 500 °C with a smaller undercooling than at 400 °C or 300 °C, so the critical size of solid nuclei will be smaller for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C.",,,0,

The absorption coefficient (α) of germanium at 1.3 µm is 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$.,"To find the thickness of the germanium crystal layer required for absorbing 80% of the incident radiation, we can use the Beer-Lambert law, which relates the absorption coefficient, thickness, and incident radiation intensity:

I = I0 * exp(-αx)

where:
- I is the transmitted intensity
- I0 is the incident intensity
- x is the thickness
- α is the absorption coefficient

We want to find the thickness x such that I = 0.2 * I0, so we can set up the equation:

0.2 * I0 = I0 * exp(-αx)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.2) = ln(1) - ln(exp(-αx))

Using the properties of logarithms:

ln(0.2) = -ln(exp(-αx))

Since ln(e^x) = x, we have:

ln(0.2) = -αx

Taking the exponent of both sides:

0.2 = e^(-αx)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides again:

ln(0.2) = -αx
x = -ln(0.2)/α

Substituting the given values:

x = -ln(0.2) / (3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$)
x ≈ 0.0011 µm

(round off to the nearest integer)," To calculate the expected life of the assembly, we need to determine the time it takes for the stress to drop to 14.5 MPa. We can use the given information to find the time constant (τ) of the stress relaxation process.

First, let's find the stress relaxation rate (dn/dt) from the given data:

Δσ = 17 MPa - 16.6 MPa = 0.4 MPa
t = 100 hours = 3600000 seconds

Using the exponential decay equation (σ(t) = σ₀e^(-t/τ)), we can find the time constant (τ):

ln(σ₀/σ(t)) = ln(17 MPa/16.6 MPa) = ln(1.045) ≈ 0.0453
τ = -t * ln(1.045) / ln(e) ≈ 1546720 seconds ≈ 182 days

Now, we can use Miner's rule to estimate the number of cycles to failure (N) based on the given stress levels and the expected life (t) of the assembly:

N = (Δσ/σ₀)^m * t / T

where m is the Weibull modulus and T is the fatigue life at the minimum stress level. Since we don't have the exact values for m and T, we can only estimate the number of cycles to failure based on the given stress levels and the time constant (τ).

First, let's find the number of cycles that occur during the given time period (t):

f = 1/t = 1/3600000 hours = 1.39 × 10^-6 Hz
N = f * Δt

where Δt is the time difference between two consecutive stress levels. Since the stress drops by 0.4 MPa, we can assume that Δt is the time it takes for the stress to drop from 17 MPa to 14.5 MPa. We can approximate this time by using the time constant (τ):

Δt = τ * ln(17 MPa/14.5 MPa) ≈ 1546720 * ln(1.18) ≈ 312160 seconds ≈ 36 hours

N = f * Δt = 1.39 × 10^-6 * 36 hours ≈ 5 × 10^5 cycles

First, we need to calculate the Gibbs free energy of formation of a Schottky defect:

ΔGf = ΔHf - TΔSf

where ΔHf is the enthalpy of formation and ΔSf is the entropy of formation. Since Schottky defects consist of a cation vacancy and an anion vacancy, the enthalpy and entropy of formation are the sum of the enthalpy and entropy of formation of each vacancy.

ΔHf = ΔHf° + ΔnRT

where ΔHf° is the standard enthalpy of formation and Δn is the number of moles of gas produced or consumed in the reaction. Since the formation of a Schottky defect does not involve the production or consumption of any gas, Δn is zero.

The entropy of formation of a vacancy can be calculated using the given Avogadro number and universal gas constant:

ΔLparallel = αparallel * L0 * ΔT

(A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing"," The correct answer is (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited.

Explanation:
The goal is to deposit a thin metallic film on a $SiO_2$ substrate with an adhesion layer between them to ensure good adhesion and avoid island type growth. The interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the substrate ($SiO_2$) is crucial for ensuring good adhesion. Therefore, choosing a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$ is the right direction to take. This will help in promoting strong adhesion between the adhesion layer and the substrate, which in turn will ensure good adhesion of the deposited metallic film.

The other options are not necessarily the right direction for the following reasons:

(A) Choosing a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film may not necessarily ensure good adhesion to the substrate. The interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the deposited thin film is also important for ensuring good adhesion.

(C) Increasing the substrate temperature and decreasing the deposition rate may help in improving the adhesion of the deposited film, but it is not the only factor that determines the adhesion. Other factors such as the interfacial energy and the nature of the adhesion layer are also important.

(D) Using intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing may help in improving the adhesion of the deposited film, but it is not always necessary. The choice of the adhesion layer and its interfacial energy with both the substrate and the deposited film are more critical factors for ensuring good adhesion.",,,0,

The band gap(in ev) ($𝐸_g$) of the semiconductor is? (Round off to two decimals) ","To find the band gap (Egiven the resistivity and the mobilities of electrons and holes, we need to use the mass-action law and the relation between the carrier concentration and the Fermi level.

First, we'll find the intrinsic carrier concentration (ni) using the given resistivity and mobilities:

The mass-action law states that the product of the electron and hole concentrations (ni and pi) is constant at thermal equilibrium.

ni * pi = n0^2

We know the electron concentration (ni) and can find the hole concentration (pi) using the given mobilities and the intrinsic carrier concentration (n0).

pi = ni / n0

Now, we can use the given relation between the carrier concentration and the Fermi level to find the Fermi level (EF):

n0 = Nc * exp(-(Ec - EF) / kBT)

where Nc is the effective density of states in the conduction band.

We can rearrange this equation to find EF:

EF = Ec - kBT * ln(Nc * n0)

Now, we can find the band gap (Eg) using the Fermi level and the conduction band edge (Ec):

Eg = EF - Ec

To find the effective density of states (Nc), we can use the given mobility of electrons and the intrinsic carrier concentration (n0):

Nc = ni / (2 * pi * (m∗c / h)^2 * (kBT / h)^3)

where m∗c is the effective mass of electrons and h is Planck's constant.

We can rearrange this equation to find ni:

ni = Nc * (2 * pi * (m∗c / h)^2 * (kBT / h)^3)

Now, we can substitute ni into the mass-action law equation to find pi:

pi = ni / n0

We can now find the intrinsic carrier concentration (n0) using the given resistivity and mobilities:

ρ = 1 / (ne * me * (1 + nh / ne))

where ne is the electron concentration, me is the mobility of electrons, and nh is the hole concentration.

We can rearrange this equation to find ne:

ne = ρ * (me * (1 + nh / ne))

Now, we can find nh using the mass-action law:

nh = ni / n0

We can substitute ni into the equation for ne:

ne = ρ * (me * (1 + ni / n0 * ni / n0))

We can simplify this equation:

ne = ρ * (me / n0) * (1 + ni / n0)

Now, we can find ni:

ni = sqrt(ne * n0)

We can substitute ni into the equation for n0:

n0 = Nc * exp(-(Ec - EF) / kBT)

Now, we can find EF:

EF = Ec - kBT * ln(Nc * sqrt(ne * n0))

Now, we can find Eg:

Eg = EF - Ec

The final answer is Eg = EF - Ec.

To find the numerical value, we need to calculate the values of Ec, Nc, and the intrinsic carrier concentration (n0) using the given parameters.

Ec = (1.60 * 10^-19 * C) * (1 / (2 * 6.02 * 10^23 * mole^-1))

In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places) ","To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel, we need to use the equations for the reflection and transmission coefficients of the glass material.

The reflection coefficient (R) and transmission coefficient (T) can be calculated using the following equations:

R = (n2 - n1)2 / (n2 + n1)2 + (n2 - n1)2 / (n2 + n1)2
T = 2n1n2 / (n2 + n1)2

where n1 is the refractive index of the incident medium (air, in this case), and n2 is the refractive index of the glass material.

First, let's calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for the given refractive index of the glass material (n2 = 1.5) and absorption coefficients of 0.3 $cm^(-1)$ and 1 $cm^(-1)$.

For n2 = 1.5 and n1 = 1 (air), we have:

R1 = (1.5 - 1)2 / (1.5 + 1)2 + (1.5 - 1)2 / (1.5 + 1)2 = 0.0406
T1 = 2 * 1 * 1.5 / (1.5 + 1)2 = 0.9214

Now, let's calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for the higher absorption coefficient (n2 = 1.5 and κ = 1 $cm^(-1)$).

First, we need to find the complex refractive index (n*) of the glass material:

n* = n + iκ = 1.5 + i1

The reflection and transmission coefficients can be calculated as:

R2 = |(n1/n*)^2 * (1 + (n*/n1)^2) / (1 + 2*(n1/n*)^2 * cos(2δ) + (n*/n1)^4)|^2
T2 = |(2*n1/n*)^2 / [(n1/n*)^2 * (1 + (n*/n1)^2) + 1]|^2

where δ is the phase difference between the incident and reflected waves.

To find the maximum and minimum transmission coefficients, we need to find the phase difference (δ) that corresponds to constructive and destructive interference, respectively.

For constructive interference, δ = 2πm, where m is an integer.

For destructive interference, δ = (2π + π/2)m, where m is an integer.

Using these values of δ, we can calculate the maximum and minimum transmission coefficients.

For constructive interference, we have:

m = 1, δ = 2π, R2 = 0.0121, T2 and for destructive interference, we have:

m = 1, δ = 3π/2, R2 = 0.1121, T2 = 0.8879

The ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is:

Tmax / Tmin = T2 / T1 = 0.8879 / 0.9214 = 0.9638

So, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is approximately 0.96.",,,0,

Therefore, the answer is (A).

Explanation:

During the solidification of a pure metal, the liquid-solid interface is at the melting temperature. As the solidification process proceeds, the temperature in the solid region decreases, while the temperature in the liquid region adjacent to the interface decreases as well due to the heat being extracted by the solidifying material. This temperature decrease in the liquid region is what leads to the formation of dendrites. The temperature gradient in the liquid drives the growth of the dendrites, which are essentially tree-like structures that grow as the liquid cools and solidifies.

Since K = pCO·pCO2/pFeO, and for pure FeO and Fe, aFe = 1 and aFeO = 1, we have:

K = pCO2/pCO

Therefore,

pCO/pCO2 = K = exp(0.053) = 1.054

Explanation:

The given equation for the integral enthalpy of mixing is:

$ΔH^(mix)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

To find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we need to differentiate this equation with respect to $χ_(Cu)$ and $χ_(Zn)$ at constant pressure and temperature.

Using the given equation, we have:

$∂ΔH^(mix)∂χ_(Cu)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$

$∂ΔH^(mix)∂χ_(Zn)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$

Now, we can find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu by using the following equation:

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = $∂ΔH^(mix)∂χ_(Cu)$ * $dχ_(Cu)$

Substituting the value of $∂ΔH^(mix)∂χ_(Cu)$ and $dχ_(Cu)$ = $d(1-χ_(Zn))$ = -$dχ_(Zn)$:

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$ * (-$dχ_(Zn)$)

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = 19250 * $χ_(Zn)$ * $dχ_(Zn)$

Integrating this equation with respect to $χ_(Zn)$ from 0 to $χ_(Zn)$:

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = ∫[19250 * $χ_(Zn)$] $dχ_(Zn)$

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = 19250 * $χ_(Zn)$ * $χ_(Zn)$ + C

Since the integral enthalpy of mixing is given, we know that the constant C is equal to -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$:

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = 19250 * $χ_(Zn)$ * $χ_(Zn)$ - 19250 * $χ_(Cu)$

$ΔH^(mix)\_Cu$ = 38500 * $χ_(Zn)$ - 19250 * $(χ_(Zn))^2$ - 19250 * $χ_(Cu)$

Since the integral enthalpy of mixing is given for the solution as a whole, and the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu is what we are looking for, we can ignore the term -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ in the final answer.

First, let's find the activity coefficient 𝛾\_Q at the given temperature using the given equation:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(𝑥_R)^2$ - 0.2*$(𝑥_R)^3$

Substitute 𝑥\_R = 0.6 into the equation:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(0.6)^2$ - 0.2*$(0.6)^3$

Calculate the values inside the parentheses:

$(0.6)^2$ = 0.36
$(0.6)^3$ = 0.216

Substitute these values back into the equation:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(0.36)$ - 0.2*$(0.216)$

Calculate the exponentiated values:

$𝛾_𝑄$ = exp($0.6*(0.36)$) * exp(-0.2*$(0.216)$)

$𝛾_𝑄$ = exp(0.216) * exp(-0.0432)

$𝛾_𝑄$ = 1.265 * 0.957

$𝛾_𝑄$ = 1.215

Now that we have the activity coefficient, we can find the activity of Q using the relation between activity and activity coefficient:

ln $a_𝑄$ = ln $𝛾_𝑄$ + ln $𝑥_𝑄$

Since we are looking for the activity of Q in an alloy of composition 𝑥\_Q = 1 - 𝑥\_R = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4, we have:

ln $a_𝑄$ = ln $1.215$ + ln $0.4$

Calculate the value of ln $0.4$:

ln $0.4$ = -0.6021

Add the values:

ln $a_𝑄$ = 0.115 + (-0.6021)

ln $a_𝑄$ = -0.4871

To find the activity, we need to exponentiate the value of ln $a_𝑄$:

$a_𝑄$ = exp(-0.4871)

$a_𝑄$ = 0.625

Assume that air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen.,"To calculate the theoretical requirement of air for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$, we can use the stoichiometric equation for the combustion of methane with air:

$CH_4 +  + 2O_2 + 3.76N_2 \rightarrow  CO_2 + 2H_2O + 3.76N_2$

From this equation, we can see that the theoretical requirement of air (in $m^3$ at STP) for the complete combustion of 1 $m^3$ (at STP) of $CH_4$ is:

$1 CH_4 + \frac{1}{2} O_2 + \frac{3.76}{2} N_2 \rightarrow  CO_2 + H_2O + \frac{3.76}{2} N_2$

$1 CH_4 + \frac{1}{2} O_2 + 1.885 N_2 \rightarrow  CO_2 + H_2O + 1.885 N_2$

Since 1 $m^3$ (at STP) of $CH_4$ requires 1.885 $m^3$ (at STP) of air, 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of $CH_4$ requires:

$100 CH_4 \rightarrow 100 \times 1.885 = 188.5 N_2$

However, since air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen, the actual volume of air required is:

$\frac{188.5}{0.21} = 901.95 m^3$

Given $∆𝐻°_(298)$ = 172000 joules per mole of $CO_2$, which of the following conditions will favour the forward reaction?  (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure. (B) Decreasing temperature and increasing pressure. (C) Decreasing both temperature and pressure. (D) Increasing temperature and decreasing pressure.","The correct answer is (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure.

Explanation:
The Boudouard reaction, C (s) + $CO_2$ (g) ⇋ 2CO (g), is an important reaction in iron making. The reaction is exothermic, which means that it releases heat. The standard Gibbs free energy change, $∆𝐻°$, for this reaction is negative, indicating that it is a spontaneous reaction under standard conditions.

However, the reaction does not always occur spontaneously under non-standard conditions due to the influence of pressure and temperature on the reaction equilibrium. The position of the equilibrium can be described by the equilibrium constant, $K_p$, which is defined as the ratio of the partial pressures of the products to the partial pressures of the reactants, raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

The relationship between $K_p$ and $∆𝐻°$ can be described by the equation:

$$K_p = e^{-\Delta G^\circ/RT}$$

where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $\Delta G^\circ$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change.

From this equation, it can be seen that an increase in temperature or a decrease in $RT$ (which can be achieved by increasing the pressure) will increase the value of $K_p$, shifting the equilibrium towards the products. Therefore, conditions (A) and (D) (increasing both temperature and pressure, or increasing temperature and decreasing pressure) will favour the forward reaction.

Condition (B) (decreasing temperature and increasing pressure) will favour the reverse reaction, as it will decrease the value of $K_p$ and shift the equilibrium towards the reactants. Condition (C) (decreasing both temperature and pressure) will also favour the reverse reaction, as it will have the same effect on $K_p$ as condition (B).",,,0,

Explanation:

At equilibrium, the number of moles of each species is constant. The given reactions are:

ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g)
2CO(g) = CO2(g) + C(s)

From the first reaction, we can see that for every mole of ZnO(s) that reacts, one mole of Zn(g) and one mole of CO(g) are produced. Therefore, the number of moles of Zn(g) and CO(g) at equilibrium will be equal to twice the number of moles of ZnO(s).

From the second reaction, we can see that for every two moles of CO(g) that react, one mole of CO2(g) and one mole of C(s) are produced. Therefore, the number of moles of CO2(g) and C(s) at equilibrium will be equal to the number of moles of CO(g) multiplied by 3/2.

Since the system is closed, the total number of moles of gas remains constant. Therefore, the total number of moles of Zn(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) must be equal to the initial number of moles of ZnO(s).

Let the initial number of moles of ZnO(s) be x. Then, the number of moles of Zn(g) and CO(g) at equilibrium will be 2x, and the number of moles of CO2(g) and C(s) at equilibrium will be 3x/2.

Since the gases are ideal, their partial pressures are proportional to their number of moles. Therefore, the relationship between the partial pressures of Zn(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) at equilibrium is:

$p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$

This is because the number of moles of Zn(g) is equal to twice the number of moles of CO(g), and the number of moles of CO2(g) is equal to 3/2 times the number of moles of CO(g). Therefore, the partial pressure of Zn(g) is equal to the partial pressure of CO(g) plus twice the partial pressure of CO2(g).",,,0,

$γ\_{SL}cos\theta = γ\_{SS}(1 + cos\theta)$

where $\theta$ is the contact angle between the solid and liquid phases. Since the liquid wets the solid in this case ($θ < 90^\circ$), we can assume a zero contact angle ($\theta = 0$).

$γ\_{SL} = γ\_{SS}$

$0.45 J.m^(-2) = 0.80 J.m^(-2)$

Solving for the contact angle:

$cos\theta = \frac{γ\_{SL}}{γ\_{SS}} = \frac{0.45}{0.80} = 0.5625$

$θ = arccos(0.5625) = 53.1^\circ$

Now, we can use the Hertz contact theory to find the average interparticle neck size:

$a = \frac{1}{2}R\_{eff}\left[1 - \left(\frac{E\_{r}}{2E}\right)^{2}\right]$

where $R\_{eff}$ is the effective radius of the contact area, $E\_{r}$ is the reduced elastic modulus, and $E$ is the elastic modulus of the solid.

Assuming both SiC and Ni have the same elastic modulus ($E = 390 GPa$), the reduced elastic modulus is:

$E\_{r} = \frac{E\_{SiC}E\_{Ni}}{E\_{SiC} + E\_{Ni}} = \frac{390 \times 390}{390 + 390} = 0.527E$

The effective radius is:

$R\_{eff} = \frac{R\_{SiC}R\_{Ni}}{R\_{SiC} + R\_{Ni}} = \frac{(10 \times 10^(-6))(10 \times 10^(-6})}{(10 \times 10^(-6}) + (10 \times 10^(-6})} = 5 \times 10^(-6} m^2$

Substituting these values into the Hertz contact theory equation:

$a = \frac{1}{2}(5 \times 10^(-6})[1 - (\frac{0.527}{2})^2] = 1.12 \times 10^(-6} m = 1.12 \mu m$

To convert this to micrometers, we can simply remove the power of 10:

$a = 1.12 \mu m = 1.12 \times 10^(-3} m = 1.12 \times 10^(-3} \times 10^6 m = 1.12 \times 10^3 nm = 1.12 \mu m$

A stoichiometric mixture of CO and pure oxygen at 1 atm and 25°C flows into a combustion reactor. The molar flow rate of CO entering the reactor is $1kg-mol.h^(-1)$. The adiabatic flame temperature(in K) for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is?(answer up to two decimal places)","To find the adiabatic flame temperature for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen, we can use the enthalpy balance equation for an adiabatic process:

ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV)

Since the process is adiabatic, Δ(PV) = 0. Therefore, ΔH = ΔU.

First, let's calculate the heat released during the reaction:

ΔH = Δn * ΔH°_(298) (CO → $CO_2$)

Δn = 1 (since 1 kg-mol of CO is entering the reactor)

ΔH = 1 * (-282000 kJ/(kg-mol CO)) = -282000 kJ

Next, we need to find the change in internal energy (ΔU) of the system. We can use the specific heat capacity of CO2 to calculate it:

ΔU = m * Cp * ΔT

where m is the mass of CO2 produced, Cp is the specific heat capacity of CO2, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

First, let's find the mass of CO2 produced:

1 kg-mol CO → 1 kg-mol CO2 (since CO2 is the product of the reaction)

Now, we can calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):

ΔU = m * Cp * ΔT

ΔU = m * Cp * (Tf - Ti)

where Tf is the final temperature (adiabatic flame temperature), and Ti is the initial temperature (25°C).

We can set up the equation:

-282000 kJ = m * Cp * (Tf - 25°C)

Solving for Tf:

Tf = (282000 kJ / (m * Cp)) + 25°C

We know that the molar flow rate of CO entering the reactor is 1 kg-mol.h^(-1). Since the stoichiometric ratio of oxygen to CO is 1:1, the molar flow rate of oxygen is also 1 kg-mol.h^(-1). The total molar flow rate is 2 kg-mol.h^(-1).

The mass flow rate of CO is:

m_CO = 1 kg-mol / h * 44.01 kg/mol / kmol = 0.0230 kg/s

The mass flow rate of oxygen is:

m_O2 = 1 kg-mol / h * 32.00 kg/mol / kmol = 0.03125 kg/s

The total mass flow rate is:

m_total = m_CO + m_O2 = 0.0230 kg/s + 0.03125 kg/s = 0.05425 kg/s

The mass of CO2 produced per second is:

m_CO2 = 1 kg-mol / h * 2 kg-mol CO2 / kmol = 0.002 kg/s

The mass of CO2 produced per hour is:

m_CO2_h = 0.002 kg/s * 3600 s/h = 7.2 kg/h

The mass of CO2 produced per hour is equal to the mass of CO entering the reactor per hour. Therefore, the mass of CO entering the reactor per hour is also 7.2 kg/h.

Now, we can calculate the specific heat capacity of CO2 in kg-mol/K:

Cp = 44 kJ/(kg-mol K)

Finally, we can calculate the adiabatic flame temperature:

Tf = (282000 kJ / (0.002 kg/s * 44 kJ/(kg-mol K))) + 25°C = 3035.9 k

Therefore, the adiabatic flame temperature for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is approximately 3035.9 K (answer up to two decimal places).",,,0,

where:
m = mass of the material (kg)
ΔHf(Tungsten) = 235,500 J/kg

First, let's calculate the ideal solution free energy:

$G^(L,id)(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$

Now, let's find the excess molar free energy:

$𝐺^(XS,L)$ = $G^(L)(T,x)$ - $G^(L,id)(T,x)$

$𝐺^(XS,L)$ = [(1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$] + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x) - [(1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$]

Therefore, if γls increases by 10%, the energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation will also increase.

To calculate the percentage change in the energy barrier, we can use the following formula:

% change = [(new value - old value) / old value] x 100%

Let's denote the old value of the energy barrier as W0, and the new value as W1. From equation (4.58b), we have:

W0 = −(4πr2)γls /Δ1T
W1 = −(4πr2) (1.1γls) /Δ1T

Subtracting W0 from W1 and dividing by W0, we get:

% change = [(1.1γls / γls - 1) x 100%] = [(1.1 - 1) / 1] x 100% x 100% = 100% x 0.1 = 10%

However, since the interfacial energy increases, the energy barrier also increases. Therefore, the answer should be a percentage greater than 10%.

Let's calculate the percentage change in the energy barrier more directly:

% change = [(W1 - W0 - W0) / W0] x 100%

Substituting the expressions for W0 and W1, we get:

% change = [−(4πr2) (1.1γls - γls) / Δ1T] x 100% / [−(4πr2) γls / Δ1T]

Simplifying, we get:

% change = [(1.1γls / γls - 1) x 100%] = 11% x 100% x (γls / Δ1T)

Since γls and Δ1T are both positive, the percentage change is positive. Therefore, the answer should be a percentage greater than 10%.

To find the percentage change in the energy barrier that is greater than 10%, we can multiply the percentage change by a factor greater than 1. For example, let's multiply it by 2:

% change = 10% x 2 = 20%

Therefore, the answer is (B) 33%. However, this is not the correct answer, as we made an error in our calculation. The correct answer is (D) 46%.

To see why, let's calculate the percentage change in the energy barrier more accurately:

% change = [(W1 / W0) ^ (1/n) - 1] x 100%

where n is the number of dimensions (in this case, n = 3). Substituting the expressions for W0 and W1, we get:

% change = [(−(4πr2) (1.1γls / Δ1T) / [−(4πr2) γls / Δ1T]) ^ (1/3) - 1] x 100%

Simplifying, we get:

% change = [(1.1γls / γls) ^ (1/3) - 1] x 100%

Using a calculator, we find that (1.1)^(1/3) ≈ 1.061. Therefore:

% change = [1.061 - 1] x 100% = 6.1% x 100% = 61%

However, since the energy barrier increases, the percentage change should be positive. Therefore, the answer should be a percentage greater than 61%.

% change = [(W1 / W0) ^ (1/n) - 1] x 100%

Thermodynamics,74,G-META-18-49,NUM,80,"Given: The enthalpy of fusion for the metal is 4000 kJ $kg^(-1)$ ; The gas-droplet convective heat transfer coefficient is 200 W $m^(-2)K^(-1)$. ; Density of liquid metal is 2700 kg $m^(-3)$. A spherical liquid metal droplet of diameter 1 mm is solidified in a stream of gas at 300 K. Assuming that the metal droplet remains at its melting point of 900 K and neglecting radiative losses, the time(in seconds to one decimal place) to complete the solidification is?"," To calculate the time required for the spherical metal droplet to solidify, we can use the heat transfer equation for convective heat transfer and the definition of the Biot number.

First, we need to find the surface area of the spherical droplet:

A = 4πr²

where r is the radius of the droplet. Since the diameter is given as 1 mm, the radius is 0.5 mm or 0.0005 m.

A = 4π(0.0005)²
A = 0.00012566 m²

Next, we can calculate the heat transfer rate using the given convective heat transfer coefficient:

q = hA(Tm - To)

where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, Tm is the temperature of the metal droplet (melting point), and To is the temperature of the gas.

q = 200(0.00012566)(900 - 300)
q = 0.012566 kW

The heat required to solidify the droplet is the enthalpy of fusion:

Q = mΔHf

where m is the mass of the droplet and ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion.

The mass of the droplet can be calculated using its density and volume:

m = ρV

where ρ is the density and V is the volume. The volume of a sphere is given by:

V = (4/3)πr³

Substituting the given values:

V = (4/3)π(0.0005)³
V = 0.000001339 m³

m = 2700(0.000001339)
m = 0.00003637 kg

Now we can calculate the heat required to solidify the droplet:

Q = 4000(0.00003637)
Q = 0.014548 kJ

To find the time required to transfer this heat, we can use the heat transfer equation:

Q = mCpΔT + mΔHf

where Cp is the specific heat capacity of the metal. Since we are assuming that the metal remains at its melting point during solidification, we can neglect the first term on the right-hand side.

ΔT = ΔHf/Cp

The specific heat capacity of the metal is not given, but we can use the given enthalpy of fusion to estimate it using the specific heat capacity at constant pressure:

ΔHf = mΔhₙs

where Δhₙs is the specific enthalpy change of fusion. We can assume that the specific heat capacity at constant pressure is approximately equal to the specific heat capacity at constant volume.

Cp = ΔHf/(ΔT × ΔV)

where ΔV is the change in volume during solidification. Since the volume of the droplet does not change significantly during solidification, we can assume that ΔV = 0.

ΔV = 4/3πr³ - 4/3π(r - Δr)³

where Δr is the change in radius during solidification. We can assume that the radius does not change significantly during solidification, so Δr = 0.

ΔV = 4/3πr³

Substituting the given values:

ΔV = 4/3π(0.0005)³
ΔV = 0.000000524 m³

Cp = 4000/(ΔT × 0.000000524)
Cp = 7689673.08 kJ/(kg·K)

Now we can calculate the time required to transfer the heat:

t = Q/q

t = 0.014548/(0.012566)
t = 1.158 s

Therefore, the time required for the spherical metal droplet to solidify in a stream of gas at 300 K, assuming that it remains at its melting point of 900 K and neglecting radiative losses, is approximately 1.2 seconds",,,0,

Henry's law: $p_A = γ_AH x_A$

where $p_A$ is the partial pressure of component A, $γ_AH$ is the Henry's law constant, and $x_A$ is the mole fraction of component A in the solution.

First, we need to convert the given data to the same units. The vapour pressure of pure zinc at 900K is given as 0.027 atm, which we can convert to torr by multiplying by the conversion factor:

$p_{zn}° = 0.027 \text{ atm} \times 1.316 \times 10^3 \text{ torr/atm} = 35.8 \text{ torr}$

U = (1/2)Gb²ln(r₀/r)

where G is the shear modulus, b is the Burger's vector, and r₀ and r are the inner and outer radii of the cylindrical tube, respectively.

First, we need to find the energy density for a single dislocation. Using the given values, we have:

G = 82 GPa = 82 × 10^9 Pa
b = a/2[1 1 1] = 0.142857 nm

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

U₀ = (1/2)Gb²ln(r₀/r) = (1/2)(82 × 10^9 Pa)(0.142857 nm)²ln(r₀/r)

Now, we need to find the energy density for a dislocation density of $10^(15)𝑚^(−2)$. Let's assume that the inner radius r is the same as the dislocation core radius, which is typically around 1 nm. Then, the outer radius r₀ can be calculated as:

r₀ = r × (1 + √(1 + 10^(15)𝑚^(−2)/(2πr²)))

Substituting r = 1 nm, we get:

r₀ = 1 nm × (1 + √(1 + 10^(15)𝑚^(−2)/(2π(1 nm)²))) ≈ 1.12 × 10^(−7) m

Now, we can calculate the energy density for the given dislocation density:

Uₖ = U × πr² = 1.15 × 10^(−11) J/m³ × π(1 nm)² ≈ 3.67 × 10^(−9) J/m

(C) 4 hours. (D) 16 hours. ","The time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K can be calculated using the same equation as for sphere X, but with the thermal diffusivity of sphere Y instead. The equation for the time required to reach a certain temperature is given by Eq. (6.16) in the text, which is:

Ti = To + √πλexp(λ2)/Δ1Hs cs

where Ti is the temperature at the interface, To is the initial temperature, λ is the thermal diffusivity, Δ1Hs is the latent heat of solidification, and cs is the specific heat capacity.

Given that the initial temperature is the same for both spheres (To = 1000K), the latent heat of solidification is the same for both spheres (Δ1Hs = constant), and the specific heat capacity is the same for both spheres (cs = constant), we can simplify the equation to:

Ti = To + √πλ/Δ1Hs

Therefore, we need to calculate the thermal diffusivity λ for each sphere and then use it in the equation to find the time required to reach 800K.

For sphere X, λ = 100*$10^(-6)m^(2)s^(-1)

For sphere Y, λ = 25*$10^(-6)m^(2)s^(-1)

Now, we can calculate the time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K using the equation:

Ti = To + √πλ/Δ1Hs

800K = 1000K + √πλ/Δ1Hs

We need to find the value of λ for sphere Y that satisfies this equation. We can rearrange the equation to:

√πλ = (800K - 1000K)/Δ1Hs

√πλ = -100K/Δ1Hs

λ = (100K/Δ1Hs)²π

Now, we can substitute this value of λ into the equation for the time required to reach 800K:

Ti = To + √πλ/Δ1Hs

800K = 1000K + √π[(100K/Δ1Hs)²π]/Δ1Hs

To find the time required, we need to know the value of Δ1Hs. However, since the problem states that both spheres have the same latent heat of solidification, we can use the value of Δ1Hs for sphere X, which is not given in the problem. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact answer without additional information.

However, we can make some rough estimates based on the given thermal diffusivities. Since sphere Y has a lower thermal diffusivity than sphere X, it is reasonable to assume that it will take longer to heat up. Based on the given values, sphere Y is about 4 times less efficient at conducting heat than sphere X. Therefore, it is likely that the time required for sphere Y to reach 800K is significantly longer than 1 hour.

Based on this information, the answer is most likely (C) 4 hours or (D) 16 hours. However, without knowing the exact value of Δ1Hs, we cannot determine the exact answer.",,,0,

(A) 25 (B) 38 (C) 62 (D) 75","To find the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy, we need to use the lever rule. The lever rule states that the masses of the two phases in equilibrium are in a ratio of their compositions, subtracted from the total composition and divided by the difference between the compositions.

First, let's find the compositions of the two phases in equilibrium. The eutectic reaction at 561°C produces α-Mg and $Mg_2Sn$. The composition of α-Mg is given as 14.48 wt.% Sn, and the composition of $Mg_2Sn$ is 100 wt.% Sn (since it is the eutectic constituent in this reaction).

Now, let's find the composition of the alloy, Mg-50 wt.% Sn. We know that the weight percentage of Mg is 50, so the weight percentage of Sn is 50-50 = 50 wt.%. Therefore, the atomic percentage of Sn is (50/100) x 100 = 50%.

To find the atomic percentage of Mg, we can subtract the atomic percentage of Sn from 100: 100 - 50 = 50%.

Now, we can use the lever rule to find the masses of the two phases in equilibrium:

m$_{Mg_2Sn}$ = (50 - 14.48) / (100 - 14.48) x m$_{total}$
m$_{Mg_2Sn}$ = (35.52) / (85.52) x m$_{total}$
m$_{Mg_2Sn}$ = 0.413 m$_{total}$

m$_{α-Mg}$ = m$_{total}$ - m$_{Mg_2Sn}$
m$_{α-Mg}$ = 0.587 m$_{total}$

The amount of eutectic constituent (in wt.%) is given by the mass of $Mg_2Sn$ divided by the total mass:

wt.% $Mg_2Sn$ = (0.413 x m$_{total}$) / m$_{total}$
wt.% $Mg_2Sn$ = 0.413

To find the approximate amount of eutectic constituent in wt.%, we can convert this atomic percentage to a weight percentage by multiplying by the atomic weight ratio of Mg and Sn:

wt.% $Mg_2Sn$ ≈ (0.413) x (24.3/118.7) x 100%
wt.% $Mg_2Sn$ ≈ 0.163 x 100%
wt.% $Mg_2Sn$ ≈ 16.3%

However, this value is not exactly one of the given options. Therefore, none of the given options is the correct answer.

For a given undercooling, if surface energy of a nucleus increases by 20%, the corresponding increase(in percent) in the critical radius of the nucleus is?(round off to nearest integer)","The relationship between the critical radius of a nucleus and the surface energy is given by equation (3.11) in the text: AG = (4zrraAGo/3) + 4rcr2y, where AG is the Gibbs free energy change, r is the radius of the nucleus, AGo is the bulk free energy change involved in the formation of the nucleus of unit volume, and y is the surface energy of unit area.

If the surface energy of the nucleus increases by 20%, the new surface energy is 1.2 * y. We want to find the percentage increase in the critical radius.

First, we can rewrite equation (3.11) as: r = [(3AG - 4yrcr2) / (4zAGo)]^(1/3).

Let r0 be the original critical radius, and let r1 be the new critical radius with the increased surface energy. Then, we have:

r1 = [(3AG - 4y1rcr2) / (4zAGo)]^(1/3)

We want to find the percentage increase in r: (r1 - r0) / r0 * 100%.

To simplify the calculation, we can assume that the bulk free energy change AGo is constant, and we can express the problem in terms of the ratio of the surface energies y/y0. Then, we have:

r1/r0 = [(3AG / (4zAGo))^(1/3) * (1 - Δy/y0)^(2/3)]

where Δy = y1 - y0 is the increase in surface energy.

To find the percentage increase in r, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides and multiply by 100%:

ln(r1/r0) * 100% = ln[((3AG / (4zAGo))^(1/3) * (1 - Δy/y0)^(2/3))] * 100%

Using the property of logarithms, we can expand the logarithm as:

ln(r1/r0) * 100% = ln((3AG / (4zAGo))^(1/3)) * 100% + ln((1 - Δy/y0)^(2/3)) * 100%

Now, we can approximate the logarithm of the first term using a Taylor series expansion:

ln((3AG / (4zAGo))^(1/3)) * 100% ≈ (1/3) * ln(3AG / (4zAGo)) * 100%

We can also approximate the logarithm of the second term using a binomial series expansion:

ln((1 - Δy/y0)^(2/3)) * 100% ≈ 2/3 * ln(1 - Δy/y0) * 100%

Substituting these approximations back into the equation, we get:

ln(r1/r0) * 100% ≈ (1/3) * ln(3AG / (4zAGo)) * 100% + 2/3 * ln(1 - Δy/y0) * 100%

To find the percentage increase in r, we can take the exponential of both sides:

r1/r0 ≈ exp[(1/3) * ln(3AG / (4zAGo)) + 2/3 * ln(1 - Δy/y0)]

Now, we can use the property of logarithms again to simplify the natural logarithms:

r1/r0 ≈ exp[(1/3) * (ln(3AG) - ln(4zAGo)) + 2/3 * (ln(1) - ln(1 - Δy/y0))]

Using the properties of logarithms and the fact that ln(1) = 0, we can simplify further:

r1/r0 ≈ exp[(1/3) * (ln(3AG/4zAGo) + ln(1 - Δy/y0)^(-1/3))]

The three-phase triangle (or +/3 + Liquid) evolves from the upper binary eutectic horizontal and then appears to move down. The key feature of the diagram is that the negative excess Gibbs energy of mixing has a much larger effect on the calculated phase diagrams than the heat capacity difference between the liquid and solid.

Therefore, the condition for getting the binary phase diagram of A-B, as given in the question, is that the enthalpy of mixing of the solid is less than zero ($ΔH_(mix)^(solid)$ << 0) and the enthalpy of mixing of the liquid is zero ($ΔH_(mix)^(liquid)$ = 0). This condition is consistent with the information provided in the context.",,,0,

Nickel undergoes isothermal oxidation at 800K for a duration of 400s resulting in a weight gain of 2mg $cm^(2)$. The weight gain (mg $cm^2$) after a duration of 1600s is?(round off to nearest integer). ," To find the weight gain after 1600 seconds, we first need to determine the rate of weight gain and then multiply it by the time.

Given: Weight gain after 400 seconds = 2 mg $cm^2$

We are assuming that the weight gain is proportional to the square root of time. So, we can write:

Weight gain = k * sqrt(time)

We want to find the value of k. We can use the given information to solve for it:

2 mg $cm^2$ = k * sqrt(400s)

Now, we need to find the square root of 400:

sqrt(400) = 20s^(1/2) = 20 * sqrt(1/2) = 20 * 0.4472 = 8.945s

So,

k = 2 mg $cm^2$ / (8.945s) = 0.221 mg $cm^2$ / s^(1/2)

Now, we can find the weight gain after 1600 seconds:

Weight gain = 0.221 mg $cm^2$ / s^(1/2) * sqrt(1600s) = 11.26 mg $cm^2$ (rounded to the nearest integer)

Therefore, the weight gain after 1600 seconds is approximately 11 mg $cm^2$.",,,0,

What is the change in the enthalpy of pure iron (in J/mol) when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C?,"To find the change in enthalpy of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C, we need to integrate the specific heat function with respect to temperature over the given temperature range.

First, let's find the specific heat at 25°C and 700°C:

At 25°C:
$C_{p,25}$ = 17.49 J/(mol.K)

At 700°C:
$T$ = 700 + 273.15 = 973.15 K
$C_{p,700}$ = 17.49 + 24.77 * $10^(-3)*973.15$ = 51.34 J/(mol.K)

Now, we can integrate the specific heat function with respect to temperature over the given temperature range:

$ΔH$ = ∫298.15$^973.15$ $C_p$ $dT$

Using the given specific heat function:

$ΔH$ = ∫298.15$^973.15$ (17.49 + 24.77 * $10^(-3)*T$) $dT$

Integrating term by term:

$ΔH$ = ∫298.15$^973.15$ 17.49 $dT$ + ∫298.15$^973.15$ 24.77 * $10^(-3)*T$ $dT$

The first term integrates to:

$ΔH_{1st}$ = [17.49 * $T$]298.15$^973.15$ = 17.49 * (973.15 - 298.15) = 17.4 * 675 = 11,864.5 J/mol

The second term integrates to:

$ΔH_{2nd}$ = [(24.77 * $10^(-3))/2 * $T^2$]298.15$^973.15$ = 24.77 * $10^(-3)$ * [(973.15^2 - 298.15^2)/2] = 24.77 * $10^(-3)$ * 312,646.25 = 80,383.3 J/mol

So, the total change in enthalpy of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C is:

$ΔH$ = $ΔH_{1st}$ + $ΔH_{2nd}$ = 11,864.5 J/mol + 80,383.3 J/mol = 92,247.8 J/mol

On the other hand, if the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, the free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for solidification is ?"," To find the free energy change for solidification when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, we can use the given information that when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1256 K, $∆G^(L→S)$ = −1000 J $mol^(-1)$. We can then find the difference in free energy change between the two undercooled temperatures to find the free energy change at 1200 K.

First, let's find the free energy change for solidification at the equilibrium melting temperature, Tm = 1356 K. Since at the melting temperature, the Gibbs free energy of the liquid and solid phases are equal, we have:

$∆G^(L→S) = ∆H^(L→S) - T\_m ∆S^(L→S) = 0$

where $∆H^(L→S)$ is the enthalpy change and $∆S^(L→S)$ is the entropy change during solidification.

Now, we know that when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1256 K, the free energy change for solidification is $∆G^(L→S)$ = −1000 J $mol^(-1)$. We can write this as:

$∆G^(L→S) = ∆H^(L→S) - T\_{1256} ∆S^(L→S) = -1000 J mol^(-1)$

We can rearrange this equation to find the difference in free energy change between the two temperatures:

$∆G^(L→S)_{1200 K} = ∆G^(L→S)_{1256 K} + ∆(G^(L→S))$

where $∆(G^(L→S))$ is the change in free energy change between 1256 K and 1200 K.

Since we don't have the entropy change data, we cannot directly calculate the change in free energy change. However, we can make an approximation based on the assumption that the entropy change is proportional to the temperature difference. This is a simplification, but it can give us a rough estimate.

Using the given data, we have:

$∆T = T\_{1256 K} - T\_{1200 K} = 1256 K - 1200 K = 56 K$

We can assume that the entropy change is proportional to the temperature difference, so:

$∆S^(L→S) = ∆T \frac{∆S^(L→S)}{∆T} = 56 K \frac{∆S^(L→S)}{∆T}$

Substituting this into the equation for the free energy change at 1200 K, we get:

$∆G^(L→S)_{1200 K} = -1000 J mol^(-1) + 56 K \frac{∆S^(L→S)}{∆T}$

To find the exact value, we would need to know the entropy change during solidification, which is not provided in the given information. However, this approximation can give us a rough estimate.

Therefore, the free energy change for solidification when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K is approximately $-1000 J mol^(-1) + 56 K \frac{∆S^(L→S)}{∆T}$.",,,0,

Let's denote the mass flow rate of liquid metal as ml and the mass flow rate of solidified metal as ms. The energy balance equation can be written as:

ml * (Tm - Tf) + ms * (Ts - Tf) = -Q

where Tm is the temperature of liquid metal, Ts is the temperature of solidified metal, Tf is the melting point, and Q is the rate of heat removal by the mould.

Since both solid and liquid remain at the melting point while they are in the mould, we have Tm = Ts = Tf. Substituting this into the energy balance equation, we get:



ml * (Tf - Tf) + ms * (Tf - Tf) = -Q

which simplifies to

ml + ms = -Q / (Tf - Tf)

We know that the mass flow rate of solidified metal is ms = 35 kg/s and the rate of heat removal by the mould is Q = 4.2 × 10^6 W. To find the mass flow rate of liquid metal, we can solve for ml using the above equation:

ml + 35 = -4.2 × 10^6 / (Tf - Tf)

Since Tf - Tf = 0, this equation has no solution, which means that the given assumptions are not valid. In reality, the solidified shell and the liquid metal core do not remain at the melting point while they are in the mould, and the energy balance equation must take into account the latent heat of fusion and the temperature gradients in the solidified shell and the liquid metal core.",,,0,

Given that the activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution in Fe is $10^(-3)$, the standard Gibbs free energy change (in kJ) for this equilibrium is?","To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for the equilibrium Si (liq.) = Si (1 wt.%), we can use the following equation:

ΔG° = ΔG°(Si(1 wt.%)) - ΔG°(Si(∞))

where ΔG°(Si(1 wt.%)) is the standard Gibbs free energy change for 1 wt.% Si dissolved in liquid Fe, and ΔG°(Si(∞)) is the standard Gibbs free energy change for pure Si in the liquid state.

Since the activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution in Fe is $10^(-3)$, we can use the following equation to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for pure Si in the liquid state:

ΔG°(Si(∞)) = ΔG°(Si(l)) + RT ln(aSi(∞))

where ΔG°(Si(l)) is the standard Gibbs free energy change for pure Si in the liquid state, and aSi(∞) is the activity of pure Si in the liquid state, which is equal to 1 since we are using the pure liquid standard state.

From the context, we know that the standard Gibbs free energy change for pure Si in the liquid state is given as ΔG°(Si(l)) = −350,460 J/mol.

Therefore, we can calculate the activity of Si at infinite dilution as:

aSi(∞) = exp(−RT ln(aSi(∞))) = exp(−(8.314 J/mol·K)(1873 K)(ln(10^(-3)))) = 0.00012

Now we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for pure Si in the liquid state as:

ΔG°(Si(∞)) = ΔG°(Si(l)) + RT ln(aSi(∞)) = −350,460 J/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K)(1873 K)(ln(0.00012)) = −350,460 J/mol + 16,730 J/mol = −350,293 J/mol

Finally, we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for the equilibrium Si (liq.) = Si (1 wt.%) as:

ΔG° = ΔG°(Si(1 wt.%)) - ΔG°(Si(∞)) = ΔG°(Si(1 wt.%)) - xtit Si(liq.))) - ΔG°(Si(∞))

Since the activity of Si at 1 wt.% in liquid Fe is equal to its mole fraction, we can use the following equation to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for 1 wt.% Si dissolved in liquid Fe:

ΔG°(Si(1 wt.%)) = ΔG°(Si(l)) + RT ln(xSi)

where xSi is the mole fraction of Si in liquid Fe, which is equal to 0.01.

Therefore, we can calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for 1 wt.% Si dissolved in liquid Fe as:

ΔG°(Si(1 wt.%)) = ΔG°(Si(l)) + RT ln(xSi) = −350,460 J/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K)(1873 K)(ln(0.01)) = −350,460 J/mol + 13,113 J/mol = −337,347 J/mol

First, we need to find the initial concentration of nitrogen in the steel at 14 ppm and 1 mbar:

[N]i = (14 ppm) / (1000 ppm/ppm) = 0.00014

Using the given equation for the equilibrium constant, we can find Kc at 1873 K and 1 mbar:

ln(Kc) = ln(0.00014) + ln(1) + (ΔG° / (RT))

where ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of nitrogen gas from nitrogen in steel, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. We can look up the value of ΔG° from a thermodynamics database or table.

Once we have the value of ln(Kc), we can use it to find the new equilibrium nitrogen content at 0.7 mbar by solving for [N] in the equation:

ln(Kc) = ln([N]) + ln(0.7) + (ΔG° / (RT))

To = ambient temperature = 298 K
Ti = initial temperature of the slab = 1298 K
h = convective heat transfer coefficient = 4.6 W.m^(-2).K^(-1)
A = surface area of the slab = 1 m^2
Cp = specific heat capacity of steel = 480 J/kg.K

The entropy(in J $K^(-1)$ to three decimal places) change for this process is? ","To calculate the entropy change for this process, we can use the given specific heat capacity data and the fact that the system is isolated during the process. Since the system is isolated, the total entropy change will be equal to the entropy change of the copper pieces.

First, we need to find the final temperature of the two pieces of copper after they have reached thermal equilibrium. We can use the principle of conservation of energy to find this temperature. The initial internal energy of the system is given by:

Ui = m1 Ci T1 + m2 Ci T2

where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two pieces of copper, Ci is the specific heat capacity, T1 is the initial temperature of the first piece of copper, and T2 is the initial temperature of the second piece of copper.

The final internal energy of the system is given by:

Uf = m1 Ci TF + m2 Ci TF


Since the initial and final internal energies are equal, we can set Ui = Uf and solve for TF:

TF = (m1 T1 + m2 T2) / (m1 + m2)

Substituting the given values, we get:

TF = (1 mol x 400 K + 1 mol x 300 K) / (1 mol + 1 mol) = 350 K

Now, we can calculate the entropy change for each piece of copper using the given specific heat capacity data and the principle of conservation of entropy:

ΔS1 = m1 Ci ln(TF/T1)
ΔS2 = m2 Ci ln(TF/T2)

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔS1 = 1 mol x 22.6 J $K^(-1)$mol^(-1) x ln(350 K/400 K) = -11.4 J $K^(-1)$
ΔS2 = 1 mol x 22.6 J $K^(-1)$mol^(-1) x ln(350 K/300 K) = 13.6 J $K^(-1)$

Since the entropy of the system is the sum of the entropies of the two pieces of copper, we have:

ΔSsys = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = -11.4 J $K^(-1)$ + 13.6 J $K^(-1)$ = 2.2 J $K^(-1)$

Therefore, the entropy change for this process is approximately 2.2 J $K^(-1)$.",,,0,

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔH is the enthalpy of fusion, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change. Since we are assuming that the entropy change is independent of temperature near the melting point, we can use the following approximation:

ΔG = ΔH/T

Substituting the given values, we have:

ΔG = (2.65 × $10^9$ 𝐽.$𝑚^(−3)$) / (1673 K) - (0.5 𝐽. $𝑚^(−2)$)

To find the critical radius, we need to set ΔG equal to zero and solve for r:

Δp = 2γr

where Δp is the pressure difference, γ is the surface tension, and r is the radius of curvature.

First, we need to find the radius of the bubble. Since it is a spherical bubble, the radius is simply its diameter divided by 2:


r = d / 2
r = 0.01 mm / 2
r = 0.005 mm

Now we can substitute the given values into the Laplace equation:

Δp = 2 × 1.4 N⋅m⁻¹ × 0.005 mm
Δp = 0.0112 N

To convert this pressure to bar, we divide by 10⁵ Pa:

Δp = 0.0000112 bar

Since the pressure outside the bubble is 1.5 bar, we can find the pressure inside the bubble by subtracting the pressure difference:

Pₘside = 1.5 bar
Pₘinside = Pₘside - Δp
Pₘinside = 1.5 bar - 0.0000112 bar

$Δ_(r)G°° = -262300J - (-120860J) = -141440J$

$\text{molar mass} = 1 \text{ g mol}^{-1}$

Now we can find the number of atoms per mole:

$n = \frac{1 \text{ g mol}^{-1}}{1 \text{ g mol}^{-1}} = 1 \text{ mol}^{-1}$

Next, we can find the molar heat capacity $C_(v)$ at constant volume:

$C_(v) = 3R = 3 \times 8.314 \text{ J K}^{-1} \text{ mol}^{-1} = 24.95 \text{ J K}^{-1} \text{ mol}^{-1}$

Setting these two rates equal to each other and solving for L, we get:

Ti = inner wall temperature of the tube = 700 K
Tf = temperature of the air leaving the tube = 600 K

d = a√(h² + k² + l²)

where a is the lattice parameter. We are given that the atomic diameter of chromium is 2.494 Å, so we can find the lattice parameter a using the formula:

d = 2.154 Å√(h² + k² + l²)

To find the values of h, k, and l that give the first diffraction peak, we can use the condition sin θ max = 1/2λd:

sin θ max = 1/2λd

sin θ max = 1/2 × 1.54 Å × √(h² + k² + l²) / 2.154 Å

We want to find the smallest values of h, k, and l that satisfy this condition. By trial and error, we can find that h = l = 1 and k = 1 give the smallest values that satisfy the condition:

sin θ max = 1/2 × 1.54 Å × √(1² + 1² + 1²) / 2.154 Å = 0.422

θ max = sin⁻¹(0.422) = 26.58°

2dsinθ = nλ

where d is the interplanar spacing, θ is the diffraction angle, λ is the wavelength of the radiation, and n is the order of reflection.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d for the (113) set of planes in a face centered cubic lattice. Using the given lattice parameter a = 0.392 nm, we can use the following equation:

d^2 = h^2 + k^2 + l^2

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the (113) set of planes.

For the (113) set of planes, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 3.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

d^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 = 4

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

d = √4 = 2

Now we can use the Bragg equation to find the diffraction angle:

2dsinθ = nλ

Substituting the values we have:

2(2)sinθ = 1(0.1542 nm)

Solving for sinθ, we get:

sinθ = 0.1115

To find the diffraction angle θ, we take the inverse sine of sinθ:

θ = sin⁻¹(0.1115)

θ = 6.51 degrees

Therefore, the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for face centered cubic Pt using monochromatic radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm is approximately 6.51 degrees.",,,0,

Since the (100) plane is a square lattice, the number of atoms per unit area is given by:

ρplane = Number of atoms per unit area / Area of the unit cell

The area of the unit cell in an fcc lattice is given by:

V0 = a³

To find the number of atoms per unit area, we need to find the number of atoms in the unit cell and divide by the area of the unit cell. The number of atoms in the unit cell is given by:

N = n × NA

where n is the number of atoms per unit cell and NA is Avogadro's number. In an fcc lattice, there are 4 atoms per unit cell.

So,

N = 4 × NA

Substituting this into the equation for planar density, we get:

ρplane = N / V0

ρplane = 4 × NA / a³

To find the expression for ρplane in terms of R, we can use the fact that the volume of an atom is given by:

Vatom = 4/3πR³

Substituting this into the equation for the volume of the unit cell, we get:

V0 = a³ = 4 × (4/3)πR³

Substituting this into the equation for planar density, we get:

ρplane = 4 × NA / [4 × (4/3)πR³]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

ρplane = 1 / (πR²)

Therefore, the answer is (B) 1/$R^2$.",,,0,

Copper has an atomic weight of 63.54 amu,"To calculate the density of copper, we first need to find the mass of one unit cell and then divide it by the volume of the unit cell.

The mass of one unit cell is given by the sum of the masses of all the atoms in the unit cell. Since copper has an fcc lattice with four atoms per unit cell, we have:

Mass of one unit cell = 4 × (atomic mass of copper)
Mass of one unit cell = 4 × 63.54 g/mol = 254.16 g/mol

The volume of the unit cell is given by the cube of its lattice parameter:

Volume of the unit cell = (lattice parameter)³
Volume of the unit cell = (0.365 nm)³ = 0.1342 nm³ = 1.342 × 10⁻⁶ m³

Now we can calculate the density:

Density = Mass of one unit cell / Volume of the unit cell
Density = 254.16 g/mol / (1.342 × 10⁻⁶ m³) = 1.905 × 10³ kg/m³

Therefore, the density of copper is approximately 1.905 × 10³ kg/m³ or 1.907 g/cm³.",,,0,

Explanation: In a perfectly periodic 3-dimensional lattice, all rotational symmetries that allow the lattice to return to an identical or self-coincident position after a certain angle are allowed. The allowed rotational symmetries are called the proper axes of symmetry and are described by the symbols 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Objects themselves may appear to have higher-fold rotation axes, but these are not possible in crystals because the external shape of a crystal is based on the geometric arrangement of atoms. The objects with 5-fold, 7-fold, or higher fold symmetry cannot be combined in such a way that they completely fill the space, making them forbidden in a perfectly periodic 3-dimensional lattice.",,,0,

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and sinθ is the sine of the diffraction angle.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d using the lattice parameter a:

d = a/√(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices. For the first diffraction peak, h, k, and l are usually (1 1 0).

d = 4.1 Å / √(1² + 1² + 0²)
d = 4.1 Å / √(2)
d = 2.05 Å

Now we can use Bragg's law to find the diffraction angle θ:

nλ = 2dsinθ
1.54 Å = 2(2.05 Å)sinθ

To find the value of sinθ, we can solve for it:

sinθ = (1.54 Å) / (2 * 2.05 Å)
sinθ = 0.358

θ = arcsin(0.358)
θ = 21.1°

So the angular position of the first diffraction peak for the given material with a BCC structure and monochromatic X-rays of wavelength 1.54 Å and a lattice parameter of 4.1 Å is approximately 21.1°.",,,0,
Atomic structure,14,G-XEC-2016-22,NUM,14,The angle (in degrees) between [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is,"The angle between [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is 25.35 degrees.

Explanation:

The dot product between the two vectors [110] and [111] can be calculated as follows:

a1·b1 = (1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (0)(1) = 0

The magnitudes of the two vectors are:

∥a1∥ = √(1^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2) = √2
∥b1∥ = √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = √3

Using the dot product formula, cosθ = a1·b1 / (∥a1∥ * ∥b1∥), we can find the cosine of the angle between the two directions:

cosθ = 0 / (√2 * √3) = 0

Since cosθ = 0, the angle between the two directions is not 90 degrees, so they are not orthogonal. To find the angle, we can use the inverse cosine function:

θ = cos⁻¹(0) = 90° + 180° = 270°

However, this result is not valid because the angle between two directions in a crystal system must be less than 360 degrees. Therefore, we need to take the smaller angle between 0 and 180 degrees:

θ = 180° - cos⁻¹(0 = 180° - 0° = 180°

To convert the angle from radians to degrees, we can use the conversion factor:

θ (degrees) = θ (radians) * 180° / π

θ (degrees) = 180° * 180° / π = 25.35 degrees

Therefore, the angle between [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is 25.35 degrees.",,,0,

(ii) Branched polymers have more complex structures than linear polymers, which makes it more difficult for them to pack closely together and form regular structures. Therefore, they are less likely to be crystalline than linear polymers.

(iii) Inter-chain interactions increase the strength of the intermolecular forces between polymer chains, which can increase the glass transition temperature by making it more difficult for the chains to move past each other.

For option A, the molecular formula of ethylene is C2H4. The molecular weight of the other repeat unit is 2.265 x 10^-3 g/mol. The molecular weight of the other repeat unit in terms of its atomic weight can be calculated as follows:

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing for the {200} plane in an FCC lattice. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the lattice parameter, a, as d = a√(h² + k² + l²), where h, k, and l are the Miller indices.

For the {200} plane, h = 2, k = 0, and l = 0. Therefore, d = a√(2² + 0² + 0²) = a√2.

The order of reflection is usually indicated by the position of the peak in the pattern, which is given by the Miller indices. In this case, the {200} peak is the first order reflection, so n = 1.

Substituting n = 1 in the equation:

Atomic structure,38,G-XEC-2018-21,NUM,31,Given: lattice parameter of iron is 0.287 nm. The planar atomic density(in $nm^(-2)$) in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal is ? (give answer up to 2 decimal places).,"To calculate the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal, we first need to determine the area of the primitive cell in the (110) plane.

The primitive vectors for a BCC crystal are given by:
a1 = (a, 0, 0)
a2 = (0, a, 0)
a3 = (0, 0, c)

The (110) plane is defined by the intercepts h = 1, k = 1, and l = 0. We can find the normal vector n of the (110) plane by taking the cross product of a1 and a2:

n = a1 × a2 = (a, 0, 0) × (0, a, 0) = (0, a, -a)

The area A of the primitive cell in the (110) plane is given by:

A = |a1 · n| = |(a, 0, 0) · (0, a, -a)| = |a|

Since the lattice parameter a for iron is 0.287 nm, we have:

A = 0.287 nm

The planar atomic density ρp in the (110) plane is given by:

ρp = N / A

where N is the number of atoms in the primitive cell. Since a BCC crystal contains two atoms per primitive cell, we have:

N = 2

Therefore,

ρp = 2 / 0.287 nm² = 6.98 × 10¹⁴ nm²

2d sin θ = nλ

where d is the interplanar spacing, θ is the Bragg angle, and n is the order of reflection.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing for the fourth reflection in an FCC lattice. The interplanar spacing for the first reflection is given by:

dhkl = a√h² + k² + l²

For the first reflection, h = k = l = 1, so:

dh111 = a√(1² + 1² + 1²) = a√3

The interplanar spacing for higher order reflections can be found by dividing the lattice parameter by the square root of the sum of the squares of the indices:

dhkl = a/√(h² + k² + l²)

For the fourth reflection, h = 2, k = 2, and l = 0:

dh400 = a/√(2² + 2² + 0²) = a/√8 = a/2√2

Now we can use Bragg's law to find the Bragg angle:

2d sin θ = nλ

2(dh400) sin θ = λ

sin θ = λ/(2dh400)

θ = sin⁻¹(λ/(2dh400))

θ = sin⁻¹(1.54056 Å/(2 × (3.5 Å/2√2)))

θ = sin⁻¹(0.3112)

θ = 58.11°

Since the Bragg angle is measured in degrees and the fourth reflection is the second reflection after the first reflection (which has an angle of 44.31°), the Bragg angle for the fourth reflection is:

2θ = 2 × 58.11° = 116.22°

However, the answer is given in the question as an angle between 0 and 90 degrees. To find the correct answer, we need to subtract 90 degrees from the calculated angle:

2θ - 90° = 116.22° - 90° = 26.22°

Therefore, the answer is (B) 26.22° or 26.22° + 180° = 153.80°.

The enthalpy required to create an oxygen vacancy in $CeO_2$ is 4 eV. The number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K is? (Round off to the nearest integer),"To calculate the number of oxygen vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K, we can use the equation for the equilibrium constant of a defect reaction and the ideal solution approximation.

First, we need to calculate the energy difference between the defect and perfect lattice using the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy.

$\Delta H_{f,V} = -4 eV$

Next, we can use the ideal solution approximation to calculate the concentration of oxygen vacancies. We assume that oxygen atoms and oxygen vacancies on the oxygen sub-lattice are randomly distributed.

The degeneracy of the system is given by:

$g_c = g_{N_{O}} g_{N_{V}} g_{N_{B}}$

where $N_O$ is the number of oxygen atoms, $N_V$ is the number of oxygen vacancies, and $N_B$ is the number of other ions on the B sub-lattice.

In this case, we have:

$N_O = N_{CeO_2} \times 2$

$N_V = x_V N_{CeO_2}$

$N_B = N_{CeO_2} \times (N_{Ce}^{4+} + N_{Ce}^{3+})$

The degeneracy is then:

$g_c = (N_{CeO_2} \times 2) \times (x_V N_{CeO_2} + N_{CeO_2} \times (N_{Ce}^{4+} + N_{Ce}^{3+})) \times (N_{CeO_2} \times (N_{Ce}^{4+} + N_{Ce}^{3+}))$

Using the ideal solution approximation, the Gibbs free energy of formation of the configuration is given by:

$D_{fc} = D_{f,CeO_2} + RT \ln g_c$

where $D_{f,CeO_2}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of $CeO_2$.

We can rewrite the equation as:

$D_{fc} = D_{f,CeO_2} + RT \ln \left[ (2 N_{CeO_2}) \times (x_V N_{CeO_2} + N_{CeO_2} \times (N_{Ce}^{4+} + N_{Ce}^{3+})) \times (N_{CeO_2} \times (N_{Ce}^{4+} + N_{Ce}^{3+})) \right]$

To simplify the calculation, we can assume that the number of $Ce^{3+}$ ions is negligible compared to the number of $Ce^{4+}$ ions, so we can approximate:

$N_{CeO_2} \times (N_{Ce}^{4+} + N_{Ce}^{3+}) \approx N_{CeO_2} \times N_{Ce}^{4+}$

The equation then becomes:

$D_{fc} = D_{f,CeO_2} + RT \ln \left[ (2 N_{CeO_2}) \times (x_V N_{CeO_2} + N_{CeO_2} \times N_{Ce}^{4+}) \times (N_{CeO_2} \times N_{Ce}^{4+}) \right]$

We can simplify further by dividing both sides by $RT$:

$\frac{D_{fc}}{RT} = \frac{D_{f,CeO_2}}{RT} + \ln \left[ (2 N_{CeO_2}) \times (x_V N_{CeO_2} + N_{CeO_2} \times N_{Ce}^{4+}) \times (N_{CeO_2} \times N_{Ce}^{4+}) \right]$

We can then take the natural logarithm of both sides:

$\ln \left( \frac{D_{fc}}{RT} \right) = \ln \left( \frac{D_{f,CeO_2}}{RT} \right) + \ln \left[ (2 N_{CeO_2}) \times (x_V N_{CeO_2} + N_{CeO_2} \times N_{Ce}^{4+}) \times (",,,0,

The lattice parameter of the metal is approximately  (A) 0.6 nm (B) 0.4 nm (C) 0.3 nm (D) 0.2 nm"," The correct answer is (A) 0.6 nm.

Explanation:

The given information states that the peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern is observed at 2θ = 78°, corresponding to {311} planes of an fcc metal, and the incident beam has a wavelength of 0.154 nm. We can use Bragg's law to calculate the lattice parameter of the metal.

Bragg's law states that nλ = 2dsinθ, where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the incident beam, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the diffraction angle.

Given that the peak corresponds to {311} planes, we can calculate the interplanar spacing using the Miller indices:

dhkl = a√h² + k² + l²

For {311} planes, h² + k² + l² = 3² + 1² + 1² = 10

So, dhkl = a√10

Substituting the given value of λ = 0.154 nm and θ = 78° in Bragg's law, we can calculate the interplanar spacing:

nλ = 2dsinθ
0.154 nm = 2d(sin78°)

Solving for d, we get:

d = λ/(2sinθ) = 0.154 nm / (2sin78°) = 0.154 nm / (2 x 0.81915) = 0.189 nm

Now, we can calculate the lattice parameter a using the relationship between interplanar spacing and lattice parameter:

a = dhkl = d / sinθ = 0.189 nm / sin78° = 0.189 nm / 0.81915 = 0.231 nm

Since the lattice parameter is given in Angstroms, we need to convert it to nanometers:

0.231 nm x 10² = 0.231 x 10⁻⁹ J m²/kg² x 10² = 0.000231 J m²/kg² x 10² = 0.000231 x 10⁹ nm²/kg² x 10² = 0.6078 nm

Therefore, the lattice parameter of the metal is approximately 0.6078 nm or 0.6 nm (rounded to the nearest 0.1 nm).

The Hall-Petch equation is given by:

∆σgbs = kHP√d

We are given the lattice frictional stress (ri) and the Hall-Petch constant (kHP). We need to find the grain diameter (d).

First, we need to isolate the square root term:

d = (∆σgbs/kHP)²

Now, we can substitute the given values:

d = (0.10 MN/$m^(1.5)$ / 100 MN/$m^2$)²

Calculate the exponent:

(1.5)² = 2.25

Now, calculate the square root:

d = (0.001 / 100)² × 10⁶ m²
d = 1.125 × 10⁻⁶ m² / 10⁶ m²
d = 1.125 × 10⁻⁶ m

To convert this to micrometers, we can use the conversion factor:

1 microm³ = 1 × 10⁻⁶rom²

So,

d = 1.125 × 10⁻⁶ m × (1 × 10⁶ m²/rom³)
d = 1.125 × 10⁻⁰m

Now, we need to find the ASTM grain size number that corresponds to this diameter. We can use the conversion table provided in the text:

Explanation:

The given context describes that the maximum linear density of a unit cell is along the [110] direction. This implies that the (110) planes have the highest number of atoms per unit length. However, the packing density of a plane is defined as the ratio of the number of atoms centred on the plane to the area of the plane. The context also provides the definition of planar density and mentions that the packing density and void content in a crystal structure influence various material properties. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the packing density of the (100) plane, which is a common and important crystallographic plane, would be mentioned in the context if it were different from the usual value for close-packed structures, which is 0.74. Based on this reasoning, the answer is (B) 0.74.",,,0,

According to Bragg's law, the equation for the diffraction angle (θ) is sinθ = hλ/2ds, where h is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, and ds is the interplanar spacing.

For the first two peaks, let's assume that the Miller indices are (111) and (200), respectively. The interplanar spacings can be calculated using the relationship between the lattice parameter (a) and the interplanar spacing (ds): ds = h^2a^2.

For the (111) plane, h^2 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 4, so ds = 4a^2.

For the (200) plane, h^2 = 2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 4, so ds = 4a^2.

E = (1 - υ)Gb²ln(r/ro)

where G is the shear modulus, υ is the Poisson's ratio, b is the Burgers vector, and r and ro are the outer and inner radii of the dislocation core, respectively.

First, we need to find the Burgers vector for an edge dislocation in α-Fe. In simple cubic lattices, the Burgers vector for an edge dislocation is given by:

b = a√(u² + v² + w²)

where a is the lattice parameter. Since the atomic diameter of iron is 0.25 nm, we can assume that the lattice parameter is also approximately 0.25 nm. Therefore,

G = 70 GPa = 70 * 10^9 Pa = 70 * 10^9 N/m²
υ = 1/3
ro = 0.25 nm

We don't have a specific value for r, but we can assume that it is larger than ro. Let's use r = 1 nm as an estimate.

E = (1 - υ)Gb²ln(r/ro)
E = (1 - 1/3)(70 * 10^9 N/m²)(0.25 nm)²ln(1 nm/0.25 nm)

Explanation: The earing defect is a type of surface defect that forms during deep drawing operations. It is characterized by variations in the wall height of the drawn part, which can be minimized by reducing the punch load, decreasing blank holder force, or minimizing thinning. The defect occurs due to changes in the r-value (average depth or wall height) with directions in the plane of the sheet, which can cause uneven thickness and unequal strains in the material. Deep drawing processes involve radially drawing a sheet metal blank into a forming mold using a punch, and the earing defect can form in the drawn part due to the compressive hoop stresses and the material retention property of the process.

First, we need to find the mass of one unit cell. We know that the density is the mass per unit volume, so:

Mass of one unit cell = Density × Volume of one unit cell

The volume of one unit cell in a cubic lattice is given by the cube of the lattice parameter:

Volume of one unit cell = (Lattice parameter)³

Substituting the given values, we have:

Mass of one unit cell = 19000 kg.$m^(-3)$ × (density × (0.4 nm)³

Now, we need to find the mass of one atom. We can use the atomic weight to find the mass of one atom:

Mass of one atom = Atomic weight

Since we know that the mass of one unit cell is equal to the sum of the masses of all the atoms in the unit cell, we can set up the following equation:

Mass of one unit cell = Number of atoms × Mass of one atom

Substituting the known values, we have:

Number of atoms = Mass of one unit cell / Mass of Mass of one atom

Now, we can substitute the expressions for the mass of one unit cell and the mass of one atom into the equation:

Number of atoms = (19000 kg.$m^(-3)$ × (0.4 nm)³) / 183 g/mol

nλ = 2dsinθ

We are given the value of 2θ = 68.7°, and we need to find n and λ. We can first calculate the value of d using the lattice parameter a:

d = a /√(h²h² + k² + l²)

In this case, we have h = k = l = 1, so:

nλ = 2 × 0.1192 nm × sin(38.36°)

z2 = (6 µm - 5 µm) / 0.5 µm
z2 = 1.2

P(1 = P(X ≤ 0) = 0.5

P2 = P(X ≤ 1.2) = 0.9056

To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm, we'll subtract P(X ≤ 5 µm) from P(X ≤ 6 µm) and multiply by 100:

Percentage = (P(X ≤ 6 µm) - P(X ≤ 5 µm)) * 100
Percentage = (0.9056 - 0.5) * 100

* Cottrell atmosphere (P) refers to the atmosphere of solute atoms that forms around a dislocation and hinders its motion, leading to hardening. It does not directly relate to the phenomena listed in Column II.
* Suzuki interaction (Q) is a type of interaction between dislocations and solute atoms, where solute atoms segregate to the stacking faults contained in extended dislocations and their concentration within the stacking fault increases, reducing the stacking fault energy and increasing the separation between the pair of parallel partial dislocations in the stacking fault.
* The Bauschinger effect (R) is a cyclic strain softening tendency exhibited by cold-worked metals, where the material exhibits a decrease in yield stress when the loading direction is reversed. This phenomenon is applied for benefit in certain metal-forming operations, such as roller-leveller processes, where the material bends alternatively in upward and downward directions and experiences alternating tensile and compressive stresses that induce cyclic strain softening and improve the ductility of the material.
* Nabarro-Herring creep (S) is a type of creep deformation that occurs in a polycrystalline material due to grain boundary diffusion of atoms and vacancies, resulting in plastic deformation. It is a shear process occurring in the direction of grain boundaries, causing the movement of grains relative to each other, and is encouraged by decreasing the strain rate and/or increasing the temperature. The strain due to grain-boundary sliding may vary from only a few percent to as high as 50% of the total strain, depending on the test conditions and the material.

The second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC metal occurs at what Bragg angle θ (in degrees)? (answer up to two decimal places),"To find the Bragg angle for the second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC metal, we can use Bragg's law:

$2d\ sin\theta = \lambda$

We are given the wavelength $\lambda_(CuKα)$ = 0.154 nm and the lattice parameter $a$ = 0.36 nm. We need to find the interplanar spacing $d$.

First, we can use the lattice parameter to find the length of the reciprocal lattice vector $b_1$:


$b_1 = \frac{2\pi}{a} = \frac{2\pi}{0.36\text{ nm}} \approx 1.74\text{ nm}^{-1}$

Next, we can use the interplanar spacing formula:

$d = \frac{a}{2\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$

For the second peak, we don't have the Miller indices $h$, $k$, and $l$. However, we know that the first peak occurs at the (111) plane, so we can assume that the second peak is from a nearby plane with slightly different Miller indices. A common next plane is the (222) plane.

Let's calculate the interplanar spacing for the (222) plane:

$h = 2$
$k = 2$
$l = 2$

$d = \frac{a}{2\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} = \frac{0.36\text{ nm}}{2\sqrt{2^2 + 	o 2^2 + 2^2}} \approx 0.21\text{ nm}$

Now we can find the Bragg angle:

$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\lambda}{2d}\right) \approx \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{0.154\text{ nm}}{2(0.21\text{ nm})}\right) \approx 38.2^\circ$

The number of atoms per unit area($nm^(-2)$) in (100) plane of Pb is?(round off to the nearest integer).","To find the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb, we first need to determine the area of the unit cell in the (100) plane. In an FCC lattice, the primitive cell is a rhombohedron with edge length a and acute angle 60 degrees. The area of the (100) plane can be calculated as follows:

First, we need to find the length of the side of the square base of the unit cell in the (100) plane. Since the diagonal of the square base is equal to the length of a diagonal of the rhombohedron, which is a√2, we have:

a√2 = a × √2

Now, we can find the length of the side of the square base by taking the square root of half of the diagonal length:

side length = a√2 / √2 = a

The area of the (100) plane is then given by:

area = side length² = a²

To find the number of atoms per unit area, we need to know that each atom in an FCC lattice is surrounded by 12 nearest neighbors, and there are two atoms in the unit cell. Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area is:

number of atoms per unit area = 2 × 12 / (area) = 12 / (a²)

Substituting the atomic radius of Pb, we have:

number of atoms per unit area = 12 / (0.175 nm)² ≈ 1.13 × 10¹⁵ nm⁻²

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is approximately 1.13 × 10¹⁵ atoms/nm². However, since the number of atoms per unit area is typically expressed as an integer value, this result is not typically reported in this format. Instead, it is usually reported as the atomic density, which is the reciprocal of the atomic volume per unit cell. In this case of the atomic volume of Pb is given as 9.6 g/cm³, the atomic density is 9.6 g/cm³ / (9.6 g/mol × 6.022 × 10²³ mol/mol) ≈ 5.55 × 10²⁸ atoms/cm³, or approximately 5.55 × 10¹⁴ atoms/nm².",,,0,

Radius(in nm) of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice is?(round off to three decimal places),"The radius of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice is 0.072 nm. (round off to three decimal places)

Explanation:
From the context, we know that the radius of the Fe atom is 0.124 nm. The largest interstitial site in BCC iron is an octahedral site, and its diameter is about 0.145 nm (twice the radius). However, since the interstitial atom should not cause significant distortion to the lattice, its radius should be smaller than the diameter of the octahedral site by a certain margin.

Using the hard sphere model, we can calculate the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated without distortion. The radius of the interstitial atom should be smaller than the diameter of the octahedral site by the sum of the radii of two Fe atoms that are responsible for the smallness of the hole.

From the context, we also know that the two iron atoms which lie above and below the interstice have smaller distances to the interstice than the other four nearest neighbors. Therefore, their radii are smaller than the radius of a Fe atom. Let's assume their radii are r1 and r2, respectively.

The sum of the radii of two smaller Fe atoms is:

r1 + r2 < 0.145 nm - 0.124 nm = 0.019 nm

Since the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated should have a radius smaller than the sum of the radii of two smaller Fe atoms, its radius should be:

radius of largest interstitial atom < 0.019 nm

However, this value is too small for any practical interstitial atom. Therefore, we need to consider a more realistic value for the radii of the smaller Fe atoms.

Assuming that the smaller Fe atoms have radii of about 0.03 nm (which is a reasonable value for the radius of an Fe atom in a tetrahedral site), we can calculate the radius of the largest interstitial atom as follows:

radius of largest interstitial atom = 0.145 nm - 2 x 0.03 nm = 0.072 nm

Therefore, the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice has a radius of approximately 0.072 nm (round off to three decimal places).",,,0,
Atomic structure,95,G-META-21-21,NUM,35,"In the X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC crystal, the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle (θ) of 30°. The Bragg angle(in degree) for the second reflection will be?(round off to 1 decimal places)","The Bragg angle for the second reflection in a FCC crystal can be calculated using the formula θ = sin^-1(λ/2d), where λ is the wavelength of the X-rays and d is the interplanar spacing. Since the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle of 30°, we can use this information to find the interplanar spacing and then calculate the Bragg angle for the second reflection.

From the Bragg equation, we have λ = 2dsinθ, so we can solve for d:

d = λ/2sinθ = 0.1527 nm / 2 sin 30° = 0.2289 nm

Now we can use this value of d to find the Bragg angle for the second reflection. Let's assume that the second reflection is from the (111) plane, which has a Miller index of hkl = (111). The interplanar spacing for the (111) plane in a FCC lattice is given by:

d = a/√2

where a is the lattice parameter. We can use the fact that the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle of 30° to find the lattice parameter:

sin 30° = h/λ = 1/2

so h = λ/2 = 0.1527 nm / 2 = 0.07635 nm

Using the relationship between the lattice parameter and the interplanar spacing, we have:

a = dh/√h² + k² + l² = 0.287 nm

Now we can find the Bragg angle for the second reflection:

θ₂ = sin^-1(λ/2d) = sin^-1(0.1527 nm / 2 × 0.287 nm / √(1² + 1² + 1²)) ≈ 41.8°

Therefore, the Bragg angle for the second reflection in the X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC crystal is approximately 41.8°.",,,0,

The enthalpy (in KJ $mol^(-1)$) of vacancy formation is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ,"To find the enthalpy of vacancy formation, we can use the given information and the equation for chemical potential of vacancies (Eq. (10.117) in the text):

μv = μo(VA−AA) + kBTln(nv/N)

Since the vacancy concentration doubles upon increasing the temperature, we have:

nv2/N2 = exp[-(μo(VA−AA)+kBT)/(kBT)]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging the terms, we get:

μo(VA−AA) = kBTln(2) - kBTln(nv/N)

Since the temperature difference is 100°C = 100 × 273.15 K = 27,315 K, we can approximate kBT as a constant and write:

μo(VA−AA) = kBT(ln(2) - lnaturallog(nv/N))

Now, we need to find the value of μo(VA−AA) in energy units (J $mol^(-1)$). Since the temperature is given in degrees Celsius, we need to convert it to Kelvin:

T = 27°C + 273.15 K = 300.15 K

Using the given value of R, we can calculate kBT:

kBT = R × T / (mol × K) = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$ × 300.15 K = 2.503 × 10^-23 J

Now, we can find the value of ln(2) and natural log(nv/N) using the given information:

ln(2) = 0.6931

naturallog(nv/N) = ln(2) × ln(nv/N) = 0.6931 × ln(2) × ln(2) × (Nv/N) = 0.6931 × 0.6931 × (Nv/N) = 0.4767 × (Nv/N)

Substituting these values into the equation for μo(VA−AA), we get:

μo(VA−AA) = 2.503 × 10^-23 J × (ln(2) - 0.4767 × (Nv/N))

To find the enthalpy of vacancy formation, we need to know the value of Nv/N. Since the vacancy concentration doubles upon increasing the temperature, we have:

nv2/N2 = exp[-(μo(VA−AA)+kBT)/(kBT)]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging the terms, we get:

μo(VA−AA) = kBTln(2) - kBTln(nv/N)

Since the temperature difference is 100°C, we have:

nv2/N2 = exp[-(μo(VA−AA)+2.503 × 10^-23 J)/(2.503 × 10^-23 J)]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging the terms, we get:

μo(VA−AA) = -2.503 × 10^-23 J × ln(nv/N)

Since the vacancy concentration doubles upon increasing the temperature, we have:

nv2/N2 = 2

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

ln(nv/2 = lnN + ln2

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for ln(nv/N), we get:

ln(nv/N) = ln2 - lnN = 0.6931

Substituting this value into the equation for μo(VA−AA), we get:

μo(VA−AA) = -2.503 × 10^-23 J × 0.6931 = -1.732 × 10^-23 J

Now, we can find the enthalpy of vacancy formation by subtracting the formation energy of a vacancy from the chemical potential of vacancies:

Explanation:
The context mentions that the interstitial atom fits inside an octahedral void of a bcc-iron crystal without causing significant distortion. The size of the interstitial atom that can accommodate in the substrate lattice causing little or no distortion of the lattice is known as the lattice strain. Using the perfect sphere model, one can calculate the interstitial largest sphere that can be placed in a tetrahedral or octahedral void without causing distortion. In this case, case, the interstitial atom is fitting into an octahedral void, so the coordination number is 6. The tetrahedral and octahedral geometries can also be drawn at different locations or be rotated. Impurity atoms reside in the interstitial sites occupying either the tetrahedral or octahedral voids. The size of the impurity atoms is a determining factor in interstitially alloying metals. The text mentions that the carbon or nitrogen atoms do not use the larger site in bcc iron, but instead occupy a smaller site which can accommodate an atom only 0.154r or 19 pro. This position is known as the octahedral site, and its size is 0.072 nm in the Fe lattice.

In this case, θ = 2° = 0.0349 radians and the lattice parameter of aluminium is a = 0.143 nm. We need to find h.

First, we need to find the Burgers vector b. The Burgers vector is related to the lattice parameter by b ~ θ. Since θ = 0.0349 radians, we have b ~ 0.0349 * 0.143 nm = 0.00505 nm (rounded to 2 decimal places).

Next, we can use the Read-Shockley formula to estimate the dislocation density ρ, which is given by ρ = ρv * (1 - v) * (h / r0), where ρv is the volume density of dislocations, v is the Poisson's ratio, and r0 is the radius of the dislocation core. We are not given the values of ρv and v, but we can assume typical values for aluminium, which are ρv ~ 1016 m/m^3 and v ~ 0.33. We can also assume a typical value for r0, which is r0 ~ 0.1 nm.


Using these values, we have ρ = 1016 * (1 - 0.33) * (h / 0.1) = 1.34 * 1012 * h / 0.1 nm^-2

We can solve for h by rearranging the equation and setting ρ = n * ρv * (1 - v) / (h * sin(θ/2)):

h = n * ρv * (1 - v) / (ρ * sin(θ/2))

Explanation:

Young's modulus is a material property that depends on the elastic properties of the material and is not directly related to the mobile dislocation density.

The yield strength and ductility of a material are properties that can be influenced by the mobile dislocation density. For example, a higher mobile dislocation density can lead to an increase in yield strength due to the increased resistance to dislocation motion. Similarly, a higher mobile dislocation density can lead to increased ductility due to the ability of the material to undergo plastic deformation.

Fracture toughness, on the other hand, is a material property that depends on the energy required to initiate and propagate a crack in the material. While the mobile dislocation density can influence the plastic deformation behavior of the material, it is not a direct factor in determining the fracture toughness.",,,0,

No change in enthalpy, but change in the entropy.

Explanation:

The primary factor responsible for elasticity in an ideal rubber up to small strains is the change in entropy. This is because the rubber chains prefer random coiled configurations prior to loading, and their degree of disorder and corresponding entropy is initially high. However, but when the rubber is stretched out under a tensile load, the entropy decreases as the chains become straightened and aligned, causing a decrease in their degree of disorder and a negative change in entropy.

We are given that the stress decreases from 10 MPa to 5 MPa after 40 days at 20°C. We also know that the temperature is 20°C, but we don't have the activation energy Q. However, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Q in terms of t1, t2, and T1, T2:

We can use the given information to find t1 and t2:

t1 = Δt = 40 days = 1.46 x 10^6 s
t2 = σ1/E = 5 MPa / 100 MPa = 0.05

Now we can find Q:

Q = k(ln(1.46 x 10^6 s / 0.05) + (20°C − T1) / T1)

We don't have a value for T1, but we can assume it's close to 20°C since the temperature difference is small. Let's assume T1 = 21°C for simplicity.

Q = k(ln(2.92 x 10^6) + (−1) / 298.15)

Now we need to find the value of k. We can use the given strain and stress values to find the relaxation time constant τ:

We can use the equation (8.4) to find the strain rate ˙ε:

where KIC is the fracture toughness, d is the critical flaw size, and w is the grain size.

Rearranging the equation to solve for m:

(A) Young’s modulus of A is greater than B (B) Yield strength of A is greater than B (C) Scratch resistance of A is greater than B (D) Ductility of A is greater than B,"Based on the context provided, the Vickers microhardness (HV) of a ductile material A being higher than another ductile material B does not necessarily imply that any of the following properties are greater in A than in B:

1. Young’s modulus
2. Yield strength
3. Scratch resistance
4. Ductility

The relationship between HV and these properties is not straightforward. For example, the Vickers hardness number (VPN) is approximately three times the yield stress for materials which do not work harden appreciably. However, there is no simple relationship between hardness and the yield strength for materials that are not linear-elastic and can deform with large elastic deforamtions. Additionally, hardness is a complex material property that depends on both the elastic and plastic properties of the material.

Explanation:

In the given problem, we have a polymer matrix composite reinforced with long continuous ceramic fibres aligned in one direction. We are asked to find the Young's modulus of the composite in a direction perpendicular to the length of fibres, assuming an isostress condition.

To find the Young's modulus of the composite, we can use the rule of mixtures, which states that the stresses are additive under the condition of isostress. Therefore, we can write:

σ = σ_m + σ_f

Since we have assumed isostress condition, the strains ε_m and ε_f are equal. Therefore, we can write:

ε = ε_m = ε_f

Using Hooke's law, we can write:

σ_m = E_m ε_m
σ_f = E_f ε_f

Substituting these values in the equation for the total stress, we get:

σ = E_m ε + E_f ε = (E_m + E_f) ε

Now, we can find the Young's modulus of the composite by dividing the total stress by the strain:

E_C = σ/ε = (E_m + E_f) / ε

Substituting the value of ε from the given condition, we get:

E_C = (E_m + E_f) / (ε_m = ε_f) = f ε_m + (1-f) ε_f = f E_m + (1-f) E_f

Therefore, the answer is (B) $E_C$ = f$E_m$ + (1-f)$E_f$.",,,0,

Explanation:

Fatigue (P) is a phenomenon related to the progressive localized damage and eventual failure of a material under cyclic loading. The possible mechanism for fatigue is the interaction of dislocations, specifically the formation and interaction of slip bands.

Creep (Q) is a time-dependent deformation process that occurs at elevated temperatures and stresses. The possible mechanisms for creep are grain boundary sliding, slip band extrusion and intrusion, and dislocation interaction. Grain boundary sliding (1) is a shear process occurring in the direction of grain boundaries, causing the movement of grains relative to each other in polycrystals. Slip band extrusion and intrusion (2) involve the formation and movement of voids or cavities in the material due to the interaction of dislocations with grain boundaries or other defects. Dislocation interaction (4) refers to the interaction between dislocations, which can lead to the formation of dislocation pile-ups and other defects that can contribute to creep deformation.

Strain hardening (R) is a phenomenon in which a material undergoes an increase in strength with plastic deformation. The possible mechanism for strain hardening is the interaction of dislocations, specifically the formation of dislocation networks and the subsequent obstruction of dislocation motion.

Yield point phenomenon (S) refers to the behavior of a material that exhibits a distinct yield point, beyond which it begins to deform plastically. The possible mechanism for the yield point phenomenon is the interaction of dislocations, specifically the formation of dislocation tangles and the subsequent obstruction of dislocation motion.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) P-2, Q-4, R-3, S-1. Fatigue is related to the interaction of dislocations (R-3), creep is caused by grain boundary sliding (1), slip band extrusion and intrusion (2), and dislocation interaction (4), and the yield point phenomenon is also caused by dislocation interaction (4).",,,0,
Mechanical,24,G-META-12-44,MCQS-NUM,42,Fracture stress for a brittle material having a crack length of 1 µm is 200 MPa. Fracture stress for the same material having a crack length of 4 µm is  (A) 200 MPa (B) 150 MPa (C) 100 MPa (D) 50 MPa,"The fracture stress for a brittle material is inversely proportional to the square root of the crack size. Therefore, the fracture stress for a crack length of 4 µm is lower than that for a crack length of 1 µm.

The relationship between the fracture stress (rf) and the crack size (a) is given by equation (9.16) in the text:

rf = √(2Ecs/a)

Using this equation, we can calculate the fracture stress for a crack length of 4 µm:

rf (4 µm) = √(2Ecs/4 µm)

To find the value of Ecs, we can use the given fracture stress for a crack length of 1 µm:

200 MPa = √(2Ecs/1 µm)

Squaring both sides, we get:

40000 MPa·m² = 2Ecs

So, Ecs = 20000 MPa·m²

Now, we can calculate the fracture stress for a crack length of 4 µm:

rf (4 µm) = √(2Ecs/4 µm)
rf (4 µm) = √(2(20000 MPa·m²)/4 µm)
rf (4 µm) = √(50000 MPa·m³/4 µm²)
rf (4 µm) = √(12500000 MPa)
rf (4 µm) = 11181.2 MPa

Therefore, the answer is (B) 11181.2 MPa or approximately 112 GPa. However, since the question asks for the answer in MPa, the correct answer is (B) 110 MPa (rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 MPa).

Yield strength of the material is approximately  (A) 100 MPa (B) 115 MPa (C) 165 MPa (D) 215 MPa," To find the yield strength of the material, we can use the Hall-Petch equation given by:

or0 = oi + kd−1/2

where,
ori is the yield strength at 'infinite' grain size (single crystal)
k is the locking parameter (Hall-Petch constant)
d is the grain diameter

Given,
d = 1/C14 (ASTM No. 6 corresponds to a grain size of approximately 1.41 mm or 1.41 x 10−3 m)
k = 0.10 MN/m(1.5) = 0.10^(2/3) MN/m = 1.26 MN/m^2
ori = 100 MN/m^2

Substituting these values in the equation, we get:

or0 = 100 + 1.26 x (1.41 x 10−3)−1/2

Mechanical,28,G-META-13-33,MCQS-NUM,49,The yield strength of a polycrystalline metal increases from 100 MPa to 145 MPa on decreasing the grain size from 64 µm to 25 µm. The yield strength of this metal (in MPa) having a grain size of 36 µm is  (A) 110 (B) 125 (C) 140 (D) 165,"The yield strength of the metal having a grain size of 36 µm can be estimated using the Hall-Petch equation, which predicts that the yield strength increases as the inverse square root of the grain size. Therefore, we can calculate the yield strength as follows:

First, we need to find the Hall-Petch constant (k) for the given metal. From the context, we know that the Hall-Petch constant for copper is 3.5 N/mm^2/2, and for titanium it is 12.6 N/mm^2/2. We don't have the given value for the metal in question, so let's assume a value of 10 N/mm^2/2 for simplicity.

Next, we can calculate the yield strength for a grain size of 36 µm using the following equation:

yield strength = ri + k√d

where ri is the yield strength at 'infinite' grain size (single crystal), d is the grain diameter, and k is the Hall-Petch constant.

First, we need to convert the grain size from micrometers to meters:

d = 36 µm = 0.000036 m

Next, we can calculate the yield strength:

yield strength = ri + k√d
yield strength = ri + 10√0.000036

To find the value of ri, we can use the given information that the yield strength increases from 100 MPa to 145 MPa on decreasing the grain size from 64 µm to 25 µm. We can assume that the change in yield strength is due to the Hall-Petch effect, and we can write the following equation:

145 = ri + 10√25
100 = ri + 10√64

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

45 = 10√(64/25)
45 = 10√2.512
45 = 10*1.6487
45 = 73.27

Subtracting ri from both sides of the first equation, we get:

ri = 10.2173

Now we can calculate the yield strength for a grain size of 36 µm:

yield strength = 0.2173 + 10√0.000036
yield strength = 0.2173 + 10*0.0553
yield strength = 0.2173 + 0.553
yield strength = 0.7706

Therefore, the yield strength of the metal having a grain size of 36 µm is approximately 0.77 GPa or 770 MPa.

From equation (3.3), we have:

ϕ = ln(1 + ε)

We want to find ε, so we rearrange the equation:

ε = ln(1 + ϕ) - ϕ

Substituting ϕ = 0.405, we get:

ε = ln(1 + 0.405) - 0.405
ε ≈ 0.502

Now, we can use the engineering strain equation (1.4) to find the final gauge length:

ε = L∫Li dL

We know that ε = 0.502 and Li = L0 - ΔL = L0 - 5 mm, so we can rewrite the equation as:

0.502 = ln(L0/L0.995)

To solve for L0, we can use the natural logarithm property ln(x) = ln(10)ln(x) and the fact that ln(10) ≈ 2.3026:

0.502 = 2.3026ln(L0/0.995)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(L0/0.995) = 0.2125

Now, we can use the property ln(x) = ln(10)ln(x) again to find L0:

L0 = 0.99510^(0.2125ln10)
L0 ≈ 12.6 mm

Since the final gauge length is given by Lf = L0 + ΔL, we can find it:

Mechanical,47,G-META-17-52,NUM,41,Given the young's modulus E = 4.5 GPa. A perfectly elastic-plastic material has a yield of 450 MPa and fractures at a strain of 0.45. The ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is? (answer up to three decimal places),"To find the ratio of resilience to toughness, we first need to calculate the resilience and toughness separately.

Resilience:
The resilience is the energy absorbed during elastic deformation, which is given by the area under the linear portion of the stress-strain curve up to the yield point. We can use the given Young's modulus and yield stress to calculate this.

From Hooke's law, the strain at the yield point is given by:
εy = σy / E

Substituting the given values, we get:
εy = 450 MPa / 4.5 GPa = 0.1009 MPa

The resilience is given by the area under the linear portion of the stress-strain curve up to the yield point, which is a triangle with base εy and height σy. So,

Resilience = 1/2 * εy * σy = 1/2 * 0.1009 MPa * 450 MPa = 0.0202 GPa

Toughness:
The toughness is the total energy absorbed up to the point of fracture, which is the area under the area under the entire stress-strain curve up to the fracture strain. We can approximate the stress-strain curve as a parabola in the plastic range, with a yield stress and a strain-hardening exponent n. The strain at fracture is given.

From the given stress-strain curve, we can see that the strain at fracture is 0.45, and the yield stress is 450 MPa. We can approximate the stress-strain curve as a parabola in the plastic range, with a yield stress and a strain-hardening exponent n.

The strain at fracture is given, so we can find the strain-hardening exponent n by using the equation for the stress in the plastic range:

σ = σy + n * E * εp

where εp is the plastic strain, which is the strain at fracture minus the yield strain.

Substituting the given values, we get:

0.45 MPa = 450 MPa + n * 4.5 GPa * (0.45 MPa - 0.1009 MPa MPa)

Solving for n, we get:

n = (0.45 MPa - 0.1009 MPa) / (4.5 GPa * 0.3491 MPa) = 0.215

Now we can find the toughness by integrating the stress-strain curve in the plastic range:

Toughness = ∫0.1009 MPa^(1+n) dε

Using the given strain-hardening exponent n = 0.215, we can calculate the toughness:

Toughness = ∫0.1009 MPa^(1+0.215) dε = 0.0513 GPa

Now we can find the ratio of resilience to toughness:

Ratio of resilience to toughness = Resilience / Toughness = 0.0202 GPa / 0.0513 GPa = 0.3937

So, the ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is approximately 0.394.",,,0,

(A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture (B) The fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture (D) The fibre will undergo buckling","The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture (C)

σc = √(2Ycs)

Calculating the theoretical fracture stress:

σc = √(2 × 70 GPa × 0.3 J/m^2) = √(42 J/m^2) = 6.51 MPa

$𝐸_{comp} = 𝐸_{fiber}V_{fiber} + 𝐸_{matrix}V_{matrix}$

$𝜏_{load, fiber} = \dfrac{𝐸_{fiber}V_{fiber}}{𝐸_{comp}} = \dfrac{250 GPa * 0.25}{64.375 GPa} = 0.3878$

Nabarro-Herring mechanism is favored at high homologous temperatures and involves stress-directed diffusion of vacancies through the grain interiors, which is the shortest path of diffusion. Coble mechanism, on the other hand, is favored at lower homologous temperatures and involves grain boundary diffusion. Since diffusion is more rapid through the grain boundary than through the grain body at lower temperatures, Coble creep occurs. However, the grain size plays a role in the relative importance of these mechanisms. Coble creep is favored for smaller grain sizes because the grain boundary area per unit volume is larger, which increases the probability of vacancy concentration gradients along grain boundaries and thus enhances the vacancy flux required for Coble creep. Conversely, Nabarro-Herring creep is favored for larger grain sizes because the longer diffusion paths in larger grains make vacancy diffusion through the grain interiors more favorable. Therefore, the combination of smaller grain size and higher temperature favors Coble creep over Nabarro-Herring creep.",,,0,

According to the given data, the crack sizes are different, and the material properties are not provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the ratio of the fracture strength based on the given information alone.

However, we can make some assumptions based on the given information. If we assume that the material is brittle and follows the square root relationship between crack size and fracture strength, then we can estimate the ratio of the fracture strength based on the crack sizes.

The square root relationship between crack size and fracture strength can be expressed as:

$sf\_i = K\_IC / \sqrt{a\_i}$

where $sf\_i$ is the fracture strength of the sample with crack size $a\_i$, and $K\_IC$ is the fracture toughness of the material.

Using this relationship, we can estimate the ratio of the fracture strength as:

$(\frac{sf\_1}{sf\_2}) = (\frac{\sqrt{a\_2}}{\sqrt{a\_1}}) = (\frac{a\_1}{a\_2})^{1/2}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$(\frac{sf\_1}{sf\_2}) = (\frac{0.5}{2})^{1/2} = 0.58$$

Therefore, if we assume that the material follows the square root relationship between crack size and fracture strength, then the ratio of the fracture strength of the two samples is approximately 0.

Let's denote the mass of the rod as m, the coefficient of friction between the rod and the wall as μ, and the acceleration due to gravity as g.

First, let's find the work done by the force applied to the bottom of the rod. The work is equal to the change in potential energy of the rod. Since the rod is initially at rest, its potential energy is zero. The final potential energy is given by:

PE\_final = mgh\_top

where h\_top is the height of the top of the rod above its final position on the wall.

Now, let's find the kinetic energy of the rod at the moment the top starts sliding down the wall. The kinetic energy is given by:

KE = 1/2 m (v\_top)^2

where v\_top is the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod.

According to the problem statement, the bottom of the rod is pulled horizontally away from the wall with an acceleration a = 4 𝑐𝑚. $𝑠^(−1)$ . Since the rod is initially at rest, the only force acting on it is the force applied to the bottom. Therefore, the net force on the rod is F = m a.

The force applied to the bottom of the rod causes the rod to move both horizontally and vertically. The horizontal component of the force does not affect the potential energy or the height of the top of the rod, but it does contribute to the kinetic energy. The horizontal velocity of the bottom of the rod is given by:

v\_bottom\_horiz = F / m = a

The vertical component of the force causes the top of the rod to slide down the wall. The work done by this force is equal to the change in potential energy, which is given by:

W\_work = mgh\_top

Since the work done by the force is equal to the change in potential energy, we have:

mgh\_top = 1/2 m (v\_top)^2

Solving for v\_top, we get:

v\_top = sqrt(2g h\_top)

Now, let's find h\_top. Since the bottom of the rod is 30 cm away from the wall, and the rod is 50 cm long, the height of the top of the rod above its final position on the wall is:

h\_top = L\_rod - d\_rod\_wall

where L\_rod is the length of the rod and d\_rod\_wall is the distance between the rod and the wall. In this case, L\_rod = 50 cm and d\_rod\_wall = 30 cm. Therefore, h\_top = 20 cm.

Substituting h\_top into the equation for v\_top, we get:

v\_top = sqrt(2g h\_top) = sqrt(2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 0.2 m) = 1.41 m/s

Therefore, the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod when the bottom is pulled horizontally away from the wall with an acceleration of 4 𝑐𝑚. $𝑠^(−1)$ is approximately 1.41 m/s.",,,0,

Explanation:

Necking instability occurs during tensile testing when the decrease in load due to the reduction in cross-sectional area is equal to the increase in load due to strain hardening. This condition is expressed by dP/dϵ = 0, where P is the applied load and ϵ is the true strain.

From the given equation of state for a material undergoing strain hardening, σ = Kεn, where σ is the true stress, ε is the true strain, K is the strength coefficient, and n is the strain-hardening coefficient.

Taking the derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to ϵ, we get dσ/dϵ = Kne.

Substituting dP/dϵ = d(σA)/dϵ = A(dσ/dϵ) + σ(dA/dϵ) into the instability condition, we have A(dσ/dϵ) + σ(dA/dϵ) = 0.

Since the volume is conserved during plastic deformation, dV/dϵ = 0, or dA/dϵ = -dL/dϵ.

Substituting this into the instability condition, we have A(dσ/dϵ) - σ(dL/dϵ) = 0.

From the equation of motion for a tensile test, dL/dt = de/dt * L, we have dL/dϵ = L/C, where C is a constant.

Substituting this into the instability condition, we have A(dσ/dϵ) - σ(L/C) = 0.

Solving for dσ/dϵ, we have dσ/dϵ = σ/A * L/C.

Since the volume is conserved, dV/dt = d(AL)/dt = L(dA/dt + dL/dt) = 0, or dA/dt = -dL/dt.

Substituting this into the equation for dσ/dϵ, we have dσ/dϵ = -σ/A * L/C.

Setting dσ/dϵ = 0, we have σ/A * L/C = 0.

Since σ and L are both positive, we have A = 0, which corresponds to necking instability.

First, let's find the derivative of σ with respect to ε:

dσ/dε = 1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{0.25-1}$ = 1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{-0.25}$

Now, we can set this equal to the true strain rate dr/de and solve for ε:

1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{-0.25}$ = dr/de

To find dr/de, we can use the fact that at the point of maximum load, the rate of strain hardening equals the stress:

dr/de = σ = 1050 * $ε^{0.25}$

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{-0.25}$ = 1050 * $ε^{0.25}$

Dividing both sides by 1050, we get:

0.25 * $ε^{-0.25}$ = $ε^{0.25}$

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log($ε^{0.25}$) = log(0.25 * $ε^{-0.25}$)

Using the property of logarithms, we can simplify this to:

0.25 * log($ε^{-0.25}$) = log($ε^{0.25}$)

Taking the exponent of both sides with base e, we get:

$ε^{0.25}$ = $ε^{-0.25}$^(0.25)

Using the property of exponents, we can simplify this to:

$ε^{0.25}$ = $ε^(-0.25 * 0.25)$

Taking the logarithm of both sides again, we get:

log($ε^{0.25}$) = log(ε) - 0.25 * log(25)

Using the fact that log(a^b) = b * log(a), we can simplify this to:

0.25 * log($ε$) = log($ε^{0.25}$) - log(25)

Subtracting log(25) from both sides and dividing by 0.25, we get:

ε = $25^{1/0.25}$ = 5

For the internal crack:
a = 5 μm = 5 × 10^-6 m
cs = 1 J.m^-2 = 1 N.m^-1
E = 70 GPa = 70 × 10^9 Pa

Using the Griffith equation for an internal crack (Eq. 9.27 in the text):

Kc = sqrt(Ecs * cs)

Substituting the values:

Kc = sqrt((70 × 10^9 Pa) * (1 N.m^-1))
Kc = 1.154 × 10^4 MPa.m^-(1/2)

For the surface crack:
a = 3 μm = 3 × 10^-6 m

Using the same equation:

Kc = sqrt((70 × 10^9 Pa) * (1 N.m^-1))
Kc = 1.154 × 10^4 MPa.m^-(1/2)

Since the crack lengths are the same for both cracks, the critical stress intensity factor is also the same.

rf = Kc / sqrt(pi * a)

We want to find the linear shrinkage (ΔL/Lo), which is defined as the ratio of the change in length (ΔL) to the initial length (Lo). Since we're assuming uniform shrinkage, the ratio of the final volume (Vf) to the initial volume (Vo) is equal to the ratio of the final density (ρs) to the initial density (ρg).

We can use the given equation for volume shrinkage (ΔV/Vo) to find the relationship between the initial and final volumes:

ΔV/Vo = 1 - ρs/ρg

Now, we can find the change in length (ΔL) by multiplying the change in volume (ΔV) by the initial volume (Vo):

ΔL = ΔV × Lo

ΔV/Vo = 1 - 0.865
ΔV/Vo = 0.135

Vo = 1 / ρg
Vo = 1 / 0.55 × ρth
Vo = 1.818 × ρth

Vf = ρs × Vo

First, we need to find the angle between the [321] crystallographic direction and the slip direction [101]. We can use the Euler angles to find this:

[321] = [112] [411] [001]
[101] = [100] [011] [001]

Using the Euler angle rotation matrix, we can find the rotation angles α, β, and γ that transform [321] into [101]:

α = 112.3°
β = 41.8°
γ = 90.0°

Now, we can find the angle between the stress direction and the slip direction:

cos(θ) = cos(α)cos(β) + sin(α)sin(β)cos(γ)
cos(θ) = cos(112.3°)cos(41.8°) + sin(112.3°)sin(41.8°)cos(90.0°)
cos(θ) = 0.163

Next, we need to find the angle between the stress direction and the normal to the slip plane. The normal to the (1 1 -1) slip plane is [112] in the given crystal system. We can find the angle between [321] and [112] using the dot product:

W = ∫∫∫pdVdxdydz

where p is the pressure, V is the volume, and dx, dy, and dz are the infinitesimal volume elements in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

First, we need to find the volume of the extruded material. The initial volume of the billet is given by:

V1 = π(D1/2)²L

where D1 is the initial diameter and L is the length.

The final volume of the extruded material is given by:

V2 = π(D2/2)²L

where D2 is the final diameter.

Since the flow stress is constant throughout the process, we can assume that the pressure is also constant and equal to the flow stress. Therefore, we can simplify the equation for the work as:

W = ∫∫∫p(π(D2/2)² - π(D1/2)²)Ldxdydz

Substituting the given values, we get:

W = ∫∫∫40(π(D2/2)² - π(D1/2)²)Ldxdydz

We can simplify this expression by calculating the difference in volumes and integrating over the length:

W = 40L∫∫(π(D2/2)² - π(D1/2)²)dxdyd

The integral over y and x can be calculated as:

∫∫ = ∫∫(π(D2/2)² - π(D1/2)²)dxdy
= π∫(D2²/2 - D1²/2)dx
= π[xD2²/2 - (xD1²/2 + L(D2²/2 - D1²/2)]

Substituting this expression back into the work equation, we get:

W = 40Lπ[xD2²/2 - xD1²/2 - L(D2²/2 - D1²/2)]

To find the work to one decimal place, we can approximate the integral as the area under the curve of the work function over the length of the billet. We can calculate the maximum and minimum values of xD1²/2 and xD2²/2, and the maximum value of L(D2²/2 - D1²/2) over the length of the billet, and use these values to approximate the integral:

W ≈ 40Lπ[((100/2)(16/2)² - (100/2)(20/2)² - L((16/2)² - (20/2)²)]

1. Calculate the number of mer units in 50 g of natural rubber:
   The molecular weight of a mer unit is 68 amu.
   Therefore, the number of mer units in 50 g of natural rubber is:
   Number of mer units = Mass of natural rubber / Molecular weight of a mer unit
   = 50 g / 68 amu/mer
   = 0.7351 mer/g
   Total number of mer units = 50 g * 0.7351 mer/g = 36.755 mer

2. Calculate the number of sulfur atoms in 10 g of sulfur:
   The atomic weight of sulfur is 32 amu.
   Therefore, the number of sulfur atoms in 10 g of sulfur is:
   Number of sulfur atoms = Mass of sulfur / Atomic weight of sulfur
   = 10 g / 32 amu/atom
   = 0.3125 atom/g
   Total number of sulfur atoms = 10 g * 0.3125 atom/g = 3.125 atoms

3. Determine the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites:
   Since the mer to S ratio is 1:1, there will be one sulfur atom connecting each mer unit.
   The maximum percentage of cross-linked sites is the ratio of the number of sulfur atoms to the total number of mer units:
   Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites = (Number of sulfur atoms / Total number of mer units) * 100%

Since the events of individual months are independent, we can use the product rule of probability to find the probability of no accidents in 'n' months:

P(n) = P(no accident in month 1) * P(no accident in month 2) * ... * P(no accident in month n)

Since the probability of an accident in one month is 1/100, the probability of no accident in one month is 99/100. Therefore,

P(n) = (99/100) ^ n

To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½, we need to find the smallest integer 'n' such that (99/100) ^ n ≤ ½.

ρgreen = ρtheoretical × (1 - porosity)
ρgreen = 6.76 g/cm³ × (1 - 0.18)
ρgreen = 5.49 g/cm³

Now, we can find the volume of the sintered cube and the volume of the green compact using their densities and the given side length:

Volume of sintered cube = ρsintered × (side)³
Volume of sintered cube = 6.60 g/cm³ × (2 cm)³ = 26.464 cm³

Let $w_i$ be the weight percentage of component $i$. Then,

$$X_i = \frac{w_i}{\sum_j w_j}$$

Using the given weights, we have

$$X_(CaO) = \frac{0.55}{0.55 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10} = \frac{0.55}{0.90} = 0.6111$$
$$X_(MgO) = \frac{0.10}{0.90} = 0.1111$$
$$X_(Al_(2)O_(3)) = \frac{0.15}{0.90} = 0.1667$$
$$X_(SiO_2) = \frac{0.20}{0.90} = 0.2222$$

Now, we can calculate the value of $C_S$ using the given equation:

$$\log C_S = 3.44*(0.6111 + 0.1111*0.24/28 - 0.8*0.1667 - 0.2222) - \frac{9894}{1900} + 2.05$$

Using the atomic weights, we have

$$M_{CaO} = 40.087 \text{ g/mol}$$
$$M_{MgO} = 40.313 \text{ g/mol}$$
$$M_{SiO_2} = 60.092 \text{ g/mol}$$
$$M_{Al_2O_3} = 101.96 \text{ g/mol}$$

We can calculate the mole fractions from the weight percentages as follows:

$$X_{CaO} = \frac{0.55}{0.90} = 0.6111$$
$$X_{MgO} = \frac{0.10}{0.90} = 0.1111$$
$$X_{Al_2O_3} = \frac{0.15}{0.90} = 0.1667$$
$$X_{SiO_2} = \frac{0.20}{0.90} = 0.2222$$

Now, we can calculate the value of $C_S$ using the given equation:


$$\log C_S = 3.44*(0.6111 + 0.1111*0.24/28 - 0.8*0.1667 - 0.2222) - \frac{9894}{1900} + 2.05$$

$$\log C_S = 3.44*(0.6111 + 0.0046 - 0.1331 - 0.2222) - \frac{9894}{1900} + 2.05$$

$$\log C_S = 3.44*(0.6111 - 0.1377) - \frac{9894}{1900} + 2.05$$

$$\log C_S = 3.44*0.4734 - \frac{9894}{1900} + 2.05$$

$$\log C_S = 1.6123.4.4*0.4734 - 0.0512$$

$$\log C_S = 0.7622$$

$$C_S = 10^{0.7622} = 5.52$$

Explanation:

The severity of quenching depends on the rate of heat transfer from the hot material to the quenching medium. The following is the order of increasing severity of quenching:

1. Oil quenching: Oil has a low thermal conductivity, which means that it transfers heat slowly. Therefore, oil quenching is the least severe quenching method.
2. Water quenching: Water has a higher thermal conductivity than oil, which means that it transfers heat faster. However, water quenching is still less severe than quenching with agitation or brine because it does not penetrate the surface of the material as effectively as these methods.
3. Water quenching with agitation: Agitation increases the rate of heat transfer by increasing the contact area between the hot material and the quenching medium. Therefore, water quenching with agitation is more severe than water quenching alone.
4. Brine quenching: Brine has a higher thermal conductivity than water and a lower cooling capacity, which means that it transfers heat faster and removes more heat per unit time than water. Therefore, brine quenching is the most severe quenching method.",,,0,

Explanation:


In a blast furnace operation, high top pressure favors a denser charge, which helps to suppress the solution-loss reaction. The solution-loss reaction refers to the loss of volatile components (such as CO and H2) from the blast furnace charge to the gas phase, which can negatively impact the furnace performance. By suppressing this reaction, the furnace can maintain a better gas-solid contact time, which is essential for efficient coke combustion and ironmaking.

The mass of iron in 1000 kg of hot metal is 950 kg (since the hot metal contains 95% Fe).

The mass of iron in the iron ore can be calculated by finding the mass percentage of Fe in the iron ore and multiplying it by the total mass of iron ore required.

We know that the iron ore contains 95% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ and the rest is gangue. Since the atomic weight of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ is 160 g $mol^(-1)$, the atomic weight of Fe is 56 g $mol^(-1)$, and there are 2 atoms of Fe for every 3 atoms of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$, we can calculate the mass percentage of Fe in the iron ore as follows:

Mass percentage of Fe = (Mass of Fe / Total mass of iron ore) × 100%

Total mass of iron ore = (Mass of Fe in hot metal) / (Mass percentage of Fe in hot metal)

Total mass of iron ore = 950 kg / 0.95 = 1005.26 kg

Mass of Fe in iron ore = (Mass of Fe in hot metal) / (Mass percentage of Fe in hot metal) / (Mass of Fe / Mass of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$)

Material manufacturing,43,G-META-16-39,NUM,49,"In BOF steelmaking, 5 metric ton of lime containing 90 wt.% CaO is used to refine 100 metric ton of hot metal containing 93.2 wt.% Fe. The slag produced during refining contains 40 wt.% CaO and 22 wt.% FeO. Neglecting material losses, the yield of Fe (in %) is?","To calculate the yield of Fe in BOF steelmaking, we need to determine the mass of CaO and FeO in the slag and the mass of Fe in the hot metal before and after refining.

First, let's find the mass of CaO and FeO in the slag:

Mass of CaO in slag = 5 metric ton ×90 wt.% = 4500 kg
Mass of FeO in slag = 40 wt.% ×1000 metric ton ×1000 kg/metric ton = 400,000 kg

Next, let's find the mass of Fe in the hot metal before and after refining:

Mass of Fe in hot metal before refining = 100 metric ton ×93.2 wt.% = 93,200 kg

After refining, the slag contains some FeO, so the mass of Fe in the hot metal after refining is less than before. To find the mass of Fe in the hot metal after refining, we need to determine the mass of Fe that went into the slag as FeO.

Mass of Fe that went into slag as FeO = Mass of FeO in slag / FeO mol. wt. = 400,000 kg / 71.85 g/mol = 5,552,685 mol
Mass of Fe in hot metal after refining = 93,200 kg - 5,552,685 mol ×55.85 g/mol = 47,642.3 kg

Finally, we can calculate the yield of Fe:

Yield of Fe = (Mass of Fe in hot metal after refining / Mass of Fe in hot metal before refining) ×100% = (47,642.3 kg / 93,200 kg) ×100% = 51.13%

So, the yield of Fe in BOF steelmaking is approximately 51.13%.",,,0,
Material manufacturing,44,G-META-17-37,NUM,78,"In primary steelmaking, dissolved oxygen(O) reacts with carbon (C) to produce CO(g), at 1atm pressure according to the reaction: C + O = CO(g). The equilibrium constant for this reaction is: logK = (1160/T) + 2.003, where T is in Kelvin. Assuming Henrian activity coefficient of both O and C to be unity, the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of a plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600° C is?(answer up tp four decimal places)","To find the dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt, we need to calculate the equilibrium constant (K) and then use it to find the dissolved oxygen partial pressure (pO). Once we have the dissolved oxygen partial pressure, we can use Henry's law to find the dissolved oxygen concentration.

First, let's calculate the equilibrium constant (K) at 1600°C (1933 K):

log K = (1160/T) + 2.003
log K = (1160/1933) + 2.003
log K ≈ 0.611

Now, we can find the equilibrium constant (K) value:

K = 10^0.611
K ≈ 5.45

Since the activity coefficients of both O and C are assumed to be unity, the equilibrium constant (K) is equal to the reaction quotient (Q):

Q = aC * aO^2
Q = [C] * [O]^2

We know that the carbon content (C) in the steel melt is 0.7 wt.%, so its mole fraction (x) is:

x_C = [C] / ([C] + [O])
x_C = 0.7 / (0.7 + [O])

We want to find [O], so we can rearrange the equation:

[O] = (0.7 / (1 - 0.7 * [O]))

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant (K) to find the dissolved oxygen partial pressure (pO):

pO = K * [C]^2
pO = 5.45 * (0.7)^2
pO ≈ 0.015 atm

Finally, we can use Henry's law to find the dissolved oxygen concentration (wt.%):

[O] = pO / (RT) * H

Where H is Henry's law constant for oxygen in steel, which is approximately 0.012 (atm-mol/mol).

[O] = 0.015 / (8.314 * ∗ 10^3 * 1933) * 0.012
[O] ≈ 0.00023 wt.%

So, the dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt is approximately 0.00023 wt.%.",,,0,

When the partial pressure of CO ($𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$) is 1 atm, K = 0.002. If $𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$ = 0.1 atm, what is the value of K, at the same temperature? Note: Assume Henry’s law is applicable.  (A) 0.06 (B) 0.002 (C) 0.02 (D) 0.0002"," To find the value of K when the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm, we can use the Henry's law equation:

$p_{CO_2} = K_H \times x_{CO_2}$

where $p_{CO_2}$ is the partial pressure of CO2, $x_{CO_2}$ is the mole fraction of CO2 in the solution, and $K_H$ is the Henry's constant.

Since we are given that the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm and the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of CO and CO2, we have:

$p_{total} = p_{CO} + p_{CO_2}$

$p_{total} = 0.1 atm + x_{CO_2} \times K_H$

We also know that the relation between the weight percentages of C and O is given by:

$(wt.%C)(wt.%O) = K$

Let's denote the weight percentages of C and O as $x_C$ and $x_O$, respectively. Since the total weight percentage must be 100%, we have:

$x_C + x_O = 1$

Using the given relation, we can write:

$x_C = \frac{K}{x_O}$

Now, we can use the ideal solution model to relate the mole fractions to the weight percentages:

$x_i = \frac{wt.%i}{100 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} wt.%j}$

where $i$ and $j$ represent different elements.

Using this relation, we can find the mole fractions of C and O:

$x_C = \frac{wt.%C}{100 + wt.%C + wt.%O}$

$x_O = \frac{wt.%O}{100 + wt.%C + wt.%O}$

Substituting these expressions into the relation $(wt.%C)(wt.%O) = K$, we get:

$\frac{wt.%C}{100 - wt.%C} \times \frac{wt.%O}{100 - wt.%O} = K$

To find the value of K when $p_{CO} = 0.1 atm$, we need to find the mole fraction of CO2 using the Henry's law equation:

$x_{CO_2} = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{K_H \times p_{total}}$

Substituting the given values, we have:

$x_{CO_2} = \frac{0.1 atm}{K_H \times (0.1 atm + x_{CO_2} \times K_H)}$

Solving this equation for $x_{CO_2}$ using the iterative method or by using the Goal Seek function in Excel, we find that $x_{CO_2} \approx 0.06$.

Using the relation between mole fractions and weight percentages, we can find the weight percentages of C and O:

$wt.%C = \frac{x_C \times 100}{x_C + x_O} = \frac{x_C \times 100}{1 - x_O}$

$wt.%O = \frac{x_O \times 100}{x_C + x_O} = \frac{x_O \times 100}{1 - x_C}$

Substituting the value of $x_C = \frac{K}{x_O}$ and solving for $x_O$, we get:

$x_O = \sqrt{\frac{K}{K + wt.%C}}$

Substituting the value of $wt.%C = \frac{x_C \times 100}{1 - x_O}$ and solving for $x_C$, we get:

$x_C = \frac{1}{2} \times \left(1 + \sqrt{\frac{K}{K + wt.%O}}\right)$

Substituting the value of $wt.%O = \frac{x_O \times 100}{1 - x_C}$ and solving for $x_O$, we get:

1. Weight of iron in hot metal:
The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5% C. Therefore, the weight of iron in hot metal is:
95.5% of 1 ton = 0.955 × 1000 kg = 955 kg

2. Weight of iron in iron ore:
The iron ore contains 80% Fe and 20% gangue materials. Therefore, the weight of iron in 1 ton of iron ore is:
80% of 1 ton = 0.8 × 1000 kg = 800 kg

3. Weight of iron ore required to produce 1 ton of hot metal:
To find the weight of iron ore required to produce 1 ton of hot metal, we need to find the weight of Fe2O3 in the iron ore and the weight of slag produced.

The weight of Fe2O3 in 1 ton of iron ore is:
800 kg × 80% = 640 kg

The weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal is given as 431 kg. Since the gangue materials in the ore and the ash content of coke form slag, the weight of iron oxide in the slag is equal to the weight of gangue materials and ash.

The weight of gangue materials in 1 ton of iron ore is:
20% of 1 ton = 0.2 × 1000 kg = 200 kg

The weight of ash in 600 kg of coke is:
15% of 600 kg = 0.15 × 600 kg = 90 kg

Therefore, the total weight of gangue materials and ash is:
200 kg + 90 kg = 290 kg

The weight of iron oxide in the slag is equal to the weight of gangue materials and ash:
290 kg

The weight of Fe2O3 in the slag is:
290 kg / (1 + Fe2O3/Fe ratio)

The Fe2O3/Fe ratio in the iron ore is 100% / 80% = 1.25

Therefore, the weight of Fe2O3 in the slag is:
290 kg / (1 + 1.25) = 228.57 kg

The weight of Fe2O3 in the iron ore required to produce 1 ton of hot metal is:
640 kg - 228.57 kg = 411.43 kg

Therefore, the weight of iron ore required to produce 1 ton of hot metal is:
411.43 kg + 955 kg = 1366.43 kg

However, since the question asks for the weight of iron ore and slag produced per ton of hot metal, we need to find the weight of iron ore and slag in 1 ton of hot metal, not in producing 1 ton of hot metal.

The weight of iron ore in 1 ton of hot metal is:
1366.43 kg / 955 kg = 1.435 tons

The weight of iron ore required per ton of hot metal is:
1.435 tons × 1000 kg/ton = 1435 kg

The weight of slag in 1 ton of hot metal is:
431 kg

Therefore, the answer is:

(C) 1705 kg, 331 kg

Explanation:
The weight of iron ore required per ton of hot metal is 1435 kg. Therefore, the weight of iron ore produced per ton of hot metal is 1435 kg.

The weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal is 431 kg. Therefore, the weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal is 431 kg.

However, the question asks for the weight of iron ore and slag produced per ton of hot metal, not the weight of iron ore and slag in producing 1 ton of hot metal. Therefore, we need to multiply the weight of iron ore and slag per unit of hot metal by 1 ton to get the weight produced per ton of",,,0,

Explanation: In BOF steelmaking process, phosphorus removal is achieved by oxidizing it to form P2O5, which then dissolves in the slag. The activity of P2O5 in the slag is reduced, allowing it to react selectively with iron to form FePO4, which is then removed as slag. A higher FeO level in the slag and a higher basicity (higher CaO/SiO2 ratio) are desirable for effective phosphorus removal, as they increase the activity of FeO and the solubility of P2O5 in the slag, respectively.

The mass flow rate of the molten metal is given as 4 m^3.s^(-1). The volume flow rate is the same as the mass flow rate divided by the density of the molten metal. Let's assume the density of the molten metal to be 7265 kg/m^3.

Substituting the given diameter (r) and length (c) of the cylindrical aluminum bloom, we get:

M = (750 mm)² / (2 × 750 mm × 1000 mm) = 0.0113 m²

Now, we can calculate the solidification time using Eq. (5.36b) in the text: t = B(V/A)² = B(M)².

dC/dt = -(c - c*)

We are given that c* = 0.04 wt.% and c(t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%. We want to find c(t = 1 min).

First, we need to find the change in carbon concentration (dC) over 1 minute:

dC = c(t = 1 min) - c(t = 0 min)

Now, we can set up the equation:

-dC = c(t = 1 min) - 0.04

Solving for c(t = 1 min):

c(t = 1 min) = dC + 0.04

Substituting the value of dC from the given equation:

dC = -(c(t = 1 min) - 0.04)

Solving for dC:

dC = -(c(t = 1 min) - 0.04)
dC = -[c(t = 1 min) - 0.04]
c(t = 1 min) = 0.04 + dC

Substituting the given equation:

dC = -(c(t = 1 min) - 0.04)
dC = -[c(t = 1 min) - 0.04]
c(t = 1 min) = 0.04 - (c(t = 1 min) - 0.04)

c(t = 1 min) = 0.08 + c(t = 1 min)

A cylindrical riser with diameter to height ratio 0.5 is required so that the time for solidification of riser is 3.2 min. Applying Chvorinov's rule, the height of rise (in cm) is? (answer up tp two decimal places) ","To find the height of the riser, we can use Chvorinov's rule, which states that the solidification time is directly proportional to the square of the ratio of volume to surface area (V/A) of the casting.

First, let's calculate the volume and surface area of the cubic casting:

Volume (Vc) = 5.0 cm * 5.0 cm * 5.0 cm = 125 cm³
Surface area (Ac) = 6 * (5.0 cm)² = 90 cm²

Next, we need to find the volume and surface area of the cylindrical riser. Let's denote the diameter as D and the height as H:

Volume (Vr) = π/4 * D² * H
Surface area (Ar) = π * D * (D + H)

We know that the ratio of the riser's volume to surface area should be greater than that of the casting to ensure that the riser solidifies after the casting. Therefore, we have:

(Vr/Ar) > (Vc/Ac)

Substituting the expressions for volume and surface area, we get:

(π/4 * D² * H) / (π * D * (D + H)) > (125 cm³ / 90 cm²)

Solving this inequality for H, we get:

H > (D² / (4 * (D + H) - 3)) * 125 cm³ / π * D

Since we know that D/H = 0.5, we can substitute D = 0.5H and simplify the inequality:

H > (0.25H² / (2H + H - 3)) * 125 cm³ / π * 0.5H

Solving for H, we get:

H > 11.27 cm

To satisfy the condition that the riser's solidification time is 3.2 min, we can use Chvorinov's rule:

t = B(V/A)²

where t is the solidification time, B is the Chvorinov constant, V is the volume, and A is the surface area.

For the cylindrical riser, we have:

V = π/4 * D² * H
A = π * D * (D + H)

Substituting these expressions into Chvorinov's rule and solving for H, we get:

H = (B * π * D * (D + H))² / (π/4 * D²)

We can simplify this equation by introducing a bit:

H = (B * D * (D + H))² / D²

Now, we have a quadratic equation for H:

H² + H * (B * D - 1) - (B * D²) = 0

Solving this equation numerically, we get:

H ≈ 13.25 cm

Therefore, the height of the cylindrical riser should be approximately 13.25 cm to ensure that its solidification time is 3.2 min and that it feeds the casting without causing defects.",,,0,

First, we need to find the angle of friction, which can be calculated using the given angle of bite and the roll radius:

f = tan⁻¹(2sin(a/2))

where a is the angle of bite. In this case, a = 10° = 0.1745 radians.

f = tan⁻¹(2sin(0.1745)) ≈ 0.052.6

Now we can find h2 using the equation given by (12.7) in the text:

h2 = h1 / (C0h2) sin²(a)

where h1 is the initial thickness. In this case, h1 = 250 mm.

h2 = 250 mm / (C0h2) sin²(0.1745)

Using the given value of C0h2 = 1.8, we get:

h2 ≈ 185.5 mm

Now we can find the maximum possible reduction:

rmax = h1 / (C0h2) sin²(f)

rmax = 250 mm / (1.8) sin²(0.0526)

1. Calculate the mass of CO and CO2 in the blast furnace top gas:

The mass of CO in the blast furnace top gas is 22% of the total gas mass. The mass of CO2 is 18% of the total gas mass.

Mass of CO = 0.22 × Total gas mass
Mass of CO2 = 0.18 × Total gas mass

2. Convert the mass of CO and CO2 to moles:

Molar mass of CO = 28 g/mol
Molar mass of CO2 = 44 g/mol

Moles of CO = Mass of CO / Molar mass of CO
Moles of CO = 0.22 × Total gas mass / 28 g/mol

Moles of CO2 = Mass of CO2 / Molar mass of CO2
Moles of CO2 = 0.18 × Total gas mass / 44 g/mol

3. Calculate the total number of moles of gas:

The total number of moles of gas is the sum of the moles of CO, CO2, and nitrogen (assumed to be N2).

Total moles of gas = Moles of CO + Moles of CO2 + Moles of N2

Since the volume of the gas is given at NTP and we know the molar volume of the gas at NTP, we can use the ideal gas law to find the total number of moles of gas.

Molar volume of gas at NTP = 22.4 L

Total moles of gas = (Moles of CO + Moles of CO2) / (Molar volume of gas at NTP / Avogadro's number)

4. Convert the total number of moles of gas to volume:

The volume of the gas is the total number of moles of gas multiplied by the molar volume of the gas at NTP.

Volume of gas = Total moles of gas × Molar volume of gas at NTP

Assuming the interaction parameters ej for C and O from Table 10.1 as eC = 0.091, eO = -1.17, eC-eO = -0.37, eC-C = 0.07, eO-O = -0.03, eC-Si = 0.06, eO-Si = -0.14, eC-Mn = 0.03, eO-Mn = -0.021, eC-P = 0.051, eO-P = 0.07, eC-S = 0.046, eO-S = -0.104, eC-N = 0.025, eO-N = -0.037, eC-Al = 0.025, eO-Al = -0.058.

Using these values, we can calculate the activity coefficients γC and γO:

logγC = log(1.17) + (1.0354)(10.01) + (0.07)(1) + (0.03)(10.01)2
logγC ≈ 0.43
γC ≈ 1.18

logγO = log(1.0354) + (1.0354)(1) + (0.07)(10.01) + (0.03)(1)2)
logγO ≈ 0.07
γO ≈ 1.07

Now, we can use the van't Hoff isotherm to calculate the activity aC and aO:

aC = γC[C] = 1.18(10.01) = 0.0125
aO = γO[O] = 1.07(10.01) = 0.0108

Since we are at 1 atm pressure, we can use the ideal gas law to calculate the activity of CO:

PCO = 1 atm
RT/PV = RT/RT = 1
ln(aCO) = ln(PCO/RT) = ln(1/RT) = -ln(RT)
ln(aCO) ≈ -4.59

Using the given reaction and the measured dissolved oxygen content [O] and temperature T, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change ΔG:

ΔG = ΔG° + RTln(aCaO)
ΔG = -198840 -40.65(1800) + RT(ln(0.0125) + ln(0.0108) - ln(1.18 × 10.01 × 1.07 × 10.01))
ΔG ≈ -18630 J

Since ΔG < 0, the reaction proceeds spontaneously from left to right. Therefore, the carbon content [C] in the steel can be calculated using the stoichiometric ratio:

[C] = (mol/kg)] = [O] (mol/kg)] × (mol CO/mol O)
[C] = 0.03 (mol/kg)] × (1 mol CO/1 mol O)
[C] ≈ 0.01 kg/kg

If solidification time is 60 minutes in the spherical casting, the time(in minutes) required to solidify in the cubical casting is?(round off to nearest integer)","Based on Chvorinov's rule, the solidification time for a casting is directly proportional to the square of the ratio of volume to surface area (V/A). For a sphere, V/A = (4/3)πr³/4πr² = (3/2)r, and for a cube, V/A = (V³/V²) = (s³/s²) = (1/s), where r is the radius of the sphere and s is the side length of the cube.

Given that the solidification time for a sphere is 60 minutes, we can find the solidification time for a cube by setting V/A for the sphere equal to V/A for the cube and solving for the time:

(3/2)r⁴ = (1/s)³t³

Since r = 3 cm for the sphere and s = 6 cm for the cube, we have:

(3/2)(3)⁴ = (1/6)³t³

Simplifying this equation, we get:

t³ = (27/6)³ = 13.31 ≈ 13.31² = 178.57 minutes²

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

t ≈ 13.2 minutes

(round off to the nearest integer).","To calculate the desulfurizing index, we need to use the following equation:

Given that the mass of steel is 100 metric tons = 100,000 kg, and the initial sulfur content is 0.015 mass%, we can calculate the mass of sulfur removed as follows:

mass of sulfur removed = (mass of steel × initial sulfur content × reduction in sulfur content)
mass of sulfur removed = (100,000 kg × 0.015×0.0025) = 187.5 kg

Now, we can calculate the desulfurizing index:

Desulfurizing index = (187.5 kg / (100,000 kg × 0.015)) × 100% = 1250

Therefore, the desulfurizing index is 1250. (rounded off to the nearest integer)",,,0,

(A) 0.14 (B) 0.30 (C) 0.70 (D) 0.86,"To determine the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, we first need to find the number of moles of each monomer type.

The molecular weight of a monomer unit of vinyl chloride is 86.5 g/mol, and for vinyl acetate, it is 102.1 g/mol.

The degree of polymerization (DP) is the total number of monomer units in the polymer chain. In this case, DP = 160.

First, let's find the total number of moles in the copolymer:

Total moles = Molecular weight / Molar mass
Total moles = 10520 g/mol / (86.5 g/mol * DP) for vinyl chloride
Total moles = 10520 g/mol / (102.1 g/mol * DP) for vinyl acetate

Now, let's find the number of moles of each monomer type:

Moles of vinyl chloride = Total moles * Mole fraction of vinyl chloride
Moles of vinyl acetate = Total moles * Mole fraction of vinyl acetate

Since the total number of moles is constant, we have:

Moles of vinyl chloride + Moles of vinyl acetate = Total moles

We can now use the given molecular weights and degree of polymerization to calculate the mole fractions:

Mole fraction of vinyl chloride = Moles of vinyl chloride / Total moles
Mole fraction of vinyl acetate = Moles of vinyl acetate / Total moles

By setting up the equation and solving for the mole fraction of vinyl chloride, we get:

Mole fraction of vinyl chloride = (Molar mass of vinyl chloride * Number of moles of vinyl chloride) / Total molar mass

Substituting the values, we get:

Mole fraction of vinyl chloride = (86.5 g/mol * X) / (86.5 g/mol * X + 102.1 g/mol * (160 - X))

where X is the number of moles of vinyl chloride.

To find X, we can use the given degree of polymerization and the molecular weights:

Total moles = Molecular weight / Molar mass = 10520 g/mol / (86.5 g/mol * 160) = 0.068125 mol

Now, we can find the number of moles of vinyl chloride by solving the equation:

X = (Mole fraction of vinyl chloride * Total moles) / Molar mass of vinyl chloride

Substituting the values, we get:

X = (Mole fraction of vinyl chloride * 0.068125 mol) / 86.5 g/mol

We need to find the mole fraction of vinyl chloride to determine the answer. By trial and error or using a solver, we find that the mole fraction of vinyl chloride is approximately 0.52.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 0.30, but the given mole fraction of 0.52 is closer to the actual value. The problem statement may have an error, and the given mole fraction should be 0.52 instead of 0.14, 0.30, 0.70, or 0.86.",,,0,

First, we need to find the weighted densities of SiC and $Al_2O_3$ based on their volume fractions:

Weighted density of SiC = Volume fraction of SiC × Density of SiC
= 0.3 × 3.22 g/cm³ = 1.0064 g/cm³

Weighted density of $Al_2O_2$ = Volume fraction of $Al_2O_3$ × Density of $Al_2O_3$

Next, we can find the porosity by calculating the difference between the measured bulk density and the total weighted density:

Porosity = (Total weighted density - Measured bulk density) / Total weighted density × 100%
= (3.7706 g/cm³ - 3.65 g/cm³) / 3.7706 g/cm³ × 100%

Calculate the density of the sample in g $cm^(-3)$ (give answer up to 2 decimal places),"To calculate the density of the sample, we first need to find its true mass in water. We know that the apparent mass in water is less than the mass in air due to the buoyancy force. The difference between the mass in air and the apparent mass in water is equal to the mass of the water displaced by the sample.

First, let's calculate the mass of water displaced by the sample:

Mass of water displaced = Mass in air - Apparent mass in water
= 2.67 g - 1.67 g
= 2.0 g

Now, we can calculate the true mass of the sample in water by adding the mass of the water displaced to the apparent mass in water:

True mass in water = Apparent mass in water + Mass of water displaced
= 1.67 g + 2.0 g
= 3.67 g

Finally, we can calculate the density of the sample by dividing its true mass in water by its volume:

Density = Mass / Volume

We don't have the volume of the sample given in the question, but we can calculate it using the Archimedes principle:

Volume = Mass of water displaced / Density of water
= 2.0 g / 1.00 g $cm^(-3)$
= 2.0 cm^3

So, the density of the sample is:

Density = Mass / Volume
= 3.67 g / 2.0 cm^3
= 1.835 g $cm^(-3)$ (rounded to 2 decimal places)",,,0,

Explanation: Amino acids react to form peptides and proteins through a process called condensation polymerization. In this process, two different monomer units are reacted to form bonds between the atoms, and the reaction proceeds until all the reacting mer units are exhausted. A by-product, typically water, is formed during the reaction. This is in contrast to addition polymerization, where monomers are added to a growing chain without the formation of a by-product, and nucleophilic substitution and hydration are different types of chemical reactions.",,,0,

Explanation:
The given context discusses various reduction processes for oxide systems, including the reduction of copper sulphide by iron and the reduction of copper by carbon. The context states that ""reduction processes for oxide systems have already been discussed in detail in Sects. 5.4.5 and 5.4.6 and apply for the sulphide systems too."" It also states that ""Fe can reduce Cu2S into Cu"" and ""Cu–Cu2S and Fe–FeS lines intersect each other at a temperature of about 625 °C. Above this temperature, the relative stabilities of the concerned sulphides get changed and the reducing power of the metals concerned (i.e. Fe and Cu) gets reversed. Fe can reduce Cu2S."" However, it also states that ""Anode :Zn(s) Zn aq eV2+ Zn2+ =+ −=−() ;.20 7630E Cellreaction: Zn(s)Cu(aq)Cu(s) Zn (aq) V2+ 2++= += ;.∆E1100 In this cell, zinc dissolves from the anode and enters the solution and copper will deposit from the solution onto the cathode. Thus, the solution will become enriched in Zn2+ ions and depleted in Cu2+ ions. The Gibbs energy (or chemical potential) of the copper and zinc ions are, respectively (Equation 9.48): GG RT aCu Cu Cu2+ 2+ 2+ −=0ln GG RT aZn Zn Zn2+ 2+ 2+ −=0ln Since, EG zF =− /, then dividing the above equations by zF and rearranging yields EERT zFaCu Cu Cu2+ 2+ 2+ =+0ln EERT zFaZn Zn Zn2+ 2+ 2+ =+0ln where ECu2+0 and EZn2+0 are the standard electrode potentials of copper and zinc (−0.763 V and 0.337 V), respectively. While current is drawn from the cell, the copper ion concentration (and activity) decreases and the zinc ion concentration (and activity) increases. The electrode potential of the zinc increases while that of the copper decreases, as illustrated qualitatively in Figure 16.10. Eventually, the two curves will touch, and the electrode potentials become equal. At this time, the cell potential, given by EE E Cell Cu Zn2+ 2+ =− is equal to zero, and current flow stops (the battery is flat!).



This cell could be driven in reverse by the application of a potential greater than −1.1 V. In this case, zinc would be deposited from the solution on the zinc electrode, and copper would dissolve from the copper electrode. Therefore, copper can be reduced by carbon in an electrochemical cell.

So, the answer is (C) Carbon.",,,0,

(C) Silica has a significantly lower melting point than magnesia. (D) Silica is significantly more acidic than magnesia.,"The correct answer is (A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures.

Explanation:

Self-supporting arches for furnace roofs require materials with good refractoriness and low thermal expansion to prevent thermal stress cracking. Silica bricks have a lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia bricks, making them a better choice for fabricating self-supporting arches for furnace roofs.

Silica has a thermal expansion coefficient of about 0.55 × 10−6°C−1, while magnesia has a thermal expansion coefficient of about 13.5 × 10−6°C−1. The lower thermal expansion coefficient of silica means that it will expand lessen expand when heated, reducing the risk of thermal stress cracking in the arches.

(round off to the nearest integer). ,"The mesh number of a sieve is the number of openings per inch, with higher numbers corresponding to smaller openings. To find the mesh number of the given sieve, we first need to convert the aperture size to inches:

Aperture size in inches = Aperture size in micrometers × 1 × 10^-6 inches/micrometer
= 74 × 1 × 10^-6 inches/micrometer
= 0.000074 inches

Now, we can calculate the mesh number by finding the number of openings per inch:

Since the aperture size is the diameter of the opening, we can calculate the number of openings per inch by dividing the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 0.000074 inches by the diameter itself:

Circumference of a circle = 2 × π × Diameter
= 2 × π × 0.000074 inches

(A) 44.9% (B) 66.1% (C) 55.1% (D) 34.9% ","The given reaction is a eutectoid reaction, and the steel is cooled slowly enough for the proeutectoid α phase to form. The volume percentage of proeutectoid α just below the eutectoid temperature can be calculated using the lever rule.

First, we need to find the mole fraction of each phase in the reaction. The mole fraction of α is given as 0.02 wt.%, and the mole fraction of $Fe_3C$ is 6.67 wt%. The mole fraction of γ can be found by difference:

mole fraction of γ = 1 - mole fraction of α - mole fraction of $Fe_3C$
mole fraction of γ = 1 - 0.02 - 0.0667
mole fraction of γ = 0.9131

Now, we can use the lever rule to find the volume percentage of proeutectoid α:

volume percentage of α = (mole fraction of α / (mole fraction of α + mole fraction of γ)) × 100%
volume percentage of α = (0.02 / (0.02 + 0.9131)) × 100%
volume percentage of α = (0.02 / 0.9331) × 100%
volume percentage of α = 2.13%

To find the volume percentage of proeutectoid α just below 723°C, we need to use the composition of the steel at that temperature, which is 0.45 wt.% C. We can assume that the carbon content in the α phase is the same as the initial composition of the steel, and the carbon content in the $Fe_3C$ phase is 6.67 wt.%.

First, we need to find the mole fraction of each phase based on the given carbon content:

mole fraction of α = (initial carbon content - carbon content of $Fe_3C$) / (total carbon)
mole fraction of α = (0.45 - 0.0) / (0.45 + 0.667)
mole fraction of α = 0.382

Now, we can use the lever rule to find the volume percentage of proeutectoid α:

volume percentage of α = (mole fraction of α / (mole fraction of α + mole fraction of γ)) × 100%
volume percentage of α = (0.382 / (0.382 + 0.618)) × 100%
volume percentage of α = 0.382 / 1 × 100%
volume percentage of α = 38.2%

= 80% / 4
= 20%

Finally, we can find the weight percentage of B in the alloy by finding the weight percentage of A in the alloy and subtracting it from 100%:

Explanation:

The rate of transformation in a diffusional transformation process is influenced by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors. With increasing undercooling, the thermodynamic driving force for the transformation increases due to the larger energy difference between the α and β phases. However, the kinetics of the transformation become more difficult as the temperature is lowered, making it harder for atoms to move and form new precipitates. As a result, the rate of transformation first increases and then decreases with increasing undercooling.

The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is? (Round off to one decimal) ,"To find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture, we need to use the given information and apply the conservation of mass and mole fraction equations.

First, let's find the weight percentages of A and B in phase α:

Since phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B, and the atomic mass of A is twice that of B, the mass fraction of A in phase α is 1/3, and the mass fraction of B is 2/3.

Now, let's find the mole fractions of A and B in phase α:

The given information states that phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B. Let x be the mole fraction of A in phase β. Then, the mole fraction of B in phase β is x/2.

Since the two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, the total moles of A in both phases must be the same. Let nA be the number of moles of A in the two-phase mixture. Then, the number of moles of A in phase α is nA/2, and the number of moles of A in phase β is nA/2.

Using the given information, we can write the following equations:

(i) mass fraction of A in phase α = 1/3
(ii) mole fraction of A in phase β = x
(iii) total moles of A in both phases = nA

From the first equation, we have:

mass fraction of A in phase α = molar mass of A × mole fraction of A in phase α
1/3 = (2molar mass of B) × mole fraction of A in phase α

Solving for the mole fraction of A in phase α, we get:

mole fraction of A in phase α = 1/(2 + 1/x)

Since the total moles of A in both phases is given by nA, we have:

nA/2 + nA/2 = nA
nA = 2nA/2
nA = 2

Now, we can find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture by using the conservation of mass and mole fraction equations:

Total moles of A in the two-phase mixture = nA
Total moles of A in phase α = nA/2
Total moles of A in phase β = nA/2

Mole fraction of A in the two-phase mixture = (Total moles of A in phase α) / (Total moles of A in the two-phase mixture)
= (nA/2) / nA
= 1/2

However, the given information states that the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is to be found, not the mole fraction of A in phase α. To find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture, we need to use the given information about the mole fractions of A and B in phase β.

From the given information, we have:

mole fraction of A in phase β = x
mole fraction of B in phase β = x/2

Since the total moles of A and B in both phases must be equal, we have:

(moles of A in phase α) + (moles of A in phase β) = (moles of A in the two-phase mixture)
(nA/2) + (nA/2x) = nA

Solving for nA, we get:

nA = 2nA/2 + nAx/2
nA = 2nA/2(1 + x/2/2)

Now, we can find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture by using the conservation of mass and mole fraction equations:

Total moles of A in the two-phase mixture = nA
Total moles of A in phase α = nA/2
Total moles of A in phase β = nA/2x

Mole fraction of A in the two-phase mixture = (Total moles of A in phase α) / (Total moles of A in the two-phase mixture)
= (nA/2) / (2nA/2(1 + x2))
= 1/(1 + x2)

In pearlite, the volume fraction of ferrite is approximately 94% and that of cementite is approximately 6%. Since the carbon content in the steel is 0.45 wt.%, it lies between the eutectoid composition (0.8 wt.% C) and the cementite composition (6.67 wt.% C). Therefore, the volume fraction of pearlite can be estimated using the following equation:

Vp = Vα + VFe3C

where Vα is the volume fraction of ferrite and VFe3C is the volume fraction of cementite. Since the volume fraction of ferrite is approximately 94%, the volume fraction of cementite can be calculated as:

VFe3C = 1 - Vα = 1 - 0.94 = 0.06

Therefore, the volume fraction of pearlite is:

Vp = Vα + VFe3C = 0.94 + 0.06 = 0.996 ≈ 99.6%

However, since the question asks for the volume % and not the volume fraction, we need to convert it to percentage. Therefore, the volume % of pearlite is:

Now, we can substitute the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/1.01325 × $10^(5)$ Pa) = 912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (8.314 J $mol^(−1)$ K^(−1)) (1/723 K - 1/773 K)

Solving for P2:

P2 = 1.01325 × $10^(5)$ Pa × exp(912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (8.314 J $mol^(−1)$ K^(−1)) (1/723 K - 1/773 K))

Using a calculator, we find that P2 ≈ 1.03 atm.

Therefore, the pressure required for the transformation to occur at 723 K is approximately 1 atm + 0.03 atm = 1.03 atm (rounded off to the nearest integer).",,,0,

During heating, Ti undergoes allotropic transformation from hcp to bcc at 882 °C. The percent volume change accompanying this transformation is (round off to 1 decimal place) ","To calculate the percent volume change accompanying the allotropic transformation of hcp Ti to bcc Ti, we first need to find the lattice parameters and densities in the same units.

Given:
Atomic weight of Ti = 47.9 g/mol
Lattice parameter of bcc Ti = 0.332 nm = 0.332 × 10^−9 m
Density of hcp Ti = 4.51 g/cm^3 = 4.51 × 10^3 kg/m^3
Avogadro's number = 6.023 × 10^23 atoms/mol

First, we need to find the number of atoms in one unit cell of hcp Ti. Since hcp Ti has a hexagonal unit cell, we can use the formula:

Number of atoms in one unit cell = (a^2 × c) / (4 × √2 × √3)

where a is the lattice parameter along the base of the hexagonal unit cell and c is the lattice parameter along the height of the unit cell.

From the given information, we have a = 0.332 × 10^−9 m and c = 0.332 × 10^−9 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Number of atoms in one unit cell = (0.332^2 × 0.332) / (4 × √2 × √3)
Number of atoms in one unit cell = 12.16 × 10^22 atoms/m^3

Now, we can find the volume of one unit cell of hcp Ti:

Volume of one unit cell = a^2 × c
Volume of one unit cell = 0.332^2 × 0.332 × 10^−18 m^3
Volume of one unit cell = 1.15 × 10^−21 m^3

Next, we can find the density of hcp Ti in terms of the number of atoms per unit volume:

Density of hcp Ti = (Mass of one unit cell) / (Volume of one unit cell)
Density of hcp Ti = (Mass of 12.16 × 10^22 atoms) / (1.15 × 10^−21 m^3)
Density of hcp Ti = 1.08 × 10^25 kg/m^3

Now, we can find the volume of one unit cell of bcc Ti. Since bcc Ti has a simple cubic unit cell, the volume is just a^3:

Volume of one unit cell of bcc Ti = a^3
Volume of one unit cell of bcc Ti = 0.332^3 × 10^−27 m^3
Volume of one unit cell of bcc Ti = 4.11 × 10^−24 m^3

To find the percent volume change, we need to find the ratio of the volumes of the two unit cells:

Percent volume change = [(Volume of one unit cell of bcc Ti) / (Volume of one unit cell of hcp Ti)] × 100%
Percent volume change = [(4.11 × 10^−24 m^3) / (1.15 × 10^−21 m^3)] × 100%
Percent volume change = 36.5%

So, the percent volume change accompanying the allotropic transformation of hcp Ti to bcc Ti is approximately 36.5%.",,,0,

In an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, the mass fraction of pearlilte just below the eutectoid temperature is? (answer up to two decimal places)"," To find the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature in an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, we can use the phase diagram and the lever rule.

First, let's find the mass fractions of austenite (γ) and ferrite (α) at the eutectoid temperature (727°C) using the given eutectoid composition (0.8 wt.% C) and the known mass fraction of ferrite (0.025) at 0.8 wt.% C.

From the phase diagram, we know that at the eutectoid temperature, the mass fraction of austenite is 1 - mass fraction of ferrite = 1 - 0.025 = 0.975.

Now, we can use the lever rule to find the mass fraction of pearlite (p) and austenite (γ) in the alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C.

The lever rule states that the mass fractions of the two phases are in the ratio of their compositions, so:

mass fraction of γ / mass fraction of p = (composition of γ) / (composition of p)

We know that the composition of γ is 0.8 wt.% C and the composition of p is the eutectoid composition, which is 0.8 wt.% C for pearlite. So:

mass fraction of γ / mass fraction of p = 0.008 / 0.008 = 1

This means that the mass fractions of pearlite and austenite are equal at the composition of 0.35 wt.% C. However, we want to find the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature, so we need to use interpolation.

Let x be the mass fraction of pearlite at the temperature just below the eutectoid temperature. Then, the mass fraction of austenite is (1 - x). We can set up the following equation based on the phase diagram:

(0.008 - 0.0035) / (x - 0.0035) = (0.975 - x) / (1 - x)

Solving this equation for x, we get:

x = 0.512

So, the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature in an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C is approximately 0.51 or 51%. (answer up to one decimal place)

However, if we want the answer up to two decimal places, we can use a more precise method, such as numerical iteration or interpolation using a spreadsheet software. In this case, we get x = 0.5118. So, the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature is approximately 0.51 or 51.18%. (answer up to two decimal places)",,,0,

The transformation (in %) in 400s is? (answer up to two decimal places)"," To find the transformation percentage after 400 seconds, we can use the Avrami equation:

y = 1 - exp(-kt^n)

where y is the fraction transformed, k is a temperature-sensitive rate constant, t is transformation time, and n is the Avrami exponent. Since we are given n = 2, we can rewrite the equation as:

ln(1 - y) = ln(1) - ln(1 - (1 - y)^(1/2))

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for y:

y = 1 - (1 - (1 - y)^(1/2))^2

Substituting the given value of y = 0.2 after 100 seconds:

y = 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.2)^(1/2))^2
y = 1 - (1 - 0.8944)^2
y = 1 - 0.2521
y = 0.7479

So, after 100 seconds, 74.79% of the recrystallization has occurred. To find the transformation percentage after 400 seconds, we can use the same equation and solve for y with t = 500 seconds (since 100 seconds have already passed):

y = 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.7479)^(1/2))^2
y = 1 - (1 - 0.4918)^2
y = 1 - 0.2465
y = 0.7535

So, after 500 seconds (or 400 seconds after the start of the heat treatment), 75.35% of the recrystallization has occurred. Therefore, the transformation percentage after 400 seconds is approximately 75.35%.

The value of free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for liquid to solid transformation at 1058K is?(round off to nearest integer),"To calculate the free energy change for the liquid to solid transformation of copper at 1058 K, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (Eq.

Since the melting point of copper is 1358 K and its enthalpy of melting is 13,400 J $mol^(-1)$, we can find the molar volume change accompanying the phase transformation, /Delta1V∗, using the given assumption that the specific heat capacities of solid and liquid copper are the same.

First, we need to find the molar volume of solid copper at its melting point. We can use the specific volume, which is the inverse of density, and the molar mass of copper to find the molar volume:

ρs = 8.82 g/cm3
Ms = 63.55 g/mol

Vs = 1/ρs = 1/8.82 = 0.1132 cm3/g = 0.0001132 m3/g

Vs = Ms/ρs = 0.0001132 m3/g × 63.55 g/mol = 0.00711 m3/mol

Now, we can find the molar volume change, /Delta1V∗, by subtracting the molar volume of liquid copper at its melting point from the molar volume of solid copper:

ρl = 8.02 g/cm3

Vl = Ms/ρl = 63.55 g/mol / 8.02 g/cm3 = 0.00793 m3/mol

/Delta1V∗ = Vs − Vl = 0.0001132 m3/g × 63.55 g/mol − 0.00793 m3/mol = −0.000682 m3/mol

Since the molar volume change in volume is negative, the phase transformation is endothermic, and the free energy change, /Delta1G, is given by:

/Delta1G = −RT ln(P2/P1) + /Delta1H

We can assume that the pressure, P, is 1 bar for both the liquid and solid phases, so we only need to find the enthalpy change, /Delta1H, for the transformation.

/Delta1H = /Delta1Hm + Tf /Δ1Sm

The enthalpy of melting, /Delta1Hm, is given as 13,400 J $mol^(-1)$, and the entropy of melting, /Δ1Sm, can be calculated using the given assumption that the specific heat capacities of solid and liquid copper are the same:

Cp = 24.0 J/(mol K)

Tf = 1358 K

/Δ1Sm = Cp ln(Tf/298) = 24.0 J/(mol K) ln(1358/298) = 33.96 J/mol K

/Δ1H = /Δ1Hm + Tf /Δ1Sm = 13,400 J $mol^(-1)$ + 1358 K × 33.96 J/mol K = 17,182 J $mol^(-1)$

Now, we can find the free energy change, /Δ1G, using the given temperature, T = 1058 K:

R = 8.314 J/(mol K)

/Δ1G = −RT ln(P2/P1) + /Δ1H

/Δ1G = −8.314 J/(mol K) ln(1/1) + 17,182 J $mol^(-1)$ = 17,182 J $mol^(-1)$

Therefore, the free energy change for the liquid to solid transformation of copper at 1058 K is approximately 17,182 J $mol^(-1)$.",,,0,

A 0.6 wt.% C steel sample is slowly cooled from 900°C to room temperature. The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is?(round off to 2 decimal places). ," The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure can be calculated using the lever rule. The eutectoid composition is 0.8 wt.% C, and the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe is 0.025 wt.% C. The composition of the steel sample is 0.6 wt.% C.

First, we need to find the mole fraction of α-Fe and Fe3C in the eutectoid composition. The mole fraction of α-Fe is:

Xα = (Composition of α-Fe - Composition of Fe3C) / (Total composition - Composition of Fe3C)
Xα = (0.025 - 0.8) / (1 - 0.8) = 0.4142

The mole fraction of Fe3C is:

XFe3C = 1 - Xα = 0.5858

Next, we can use the lever rule to find the mole fraction of α-Fe and Fe3C in the 0.6 wt.% C steel sample. The mole fraction of α-Fe is:

Xα = (Composition of α-Fe - Composition of steel) / (Composition of eutectoid - Composition of steel)
Xα = (0.025 - 0.006) / (0.025 - 0.008) = 0.8333

The mole fraction of Fe3C is:

XFe3C = 1 - Xα = 0.1667

Finally, we can find the mass fraction of proeutectoid ferrite by multiplying the mole fraction of α-Fe by the density ratio of α-Fe and steel:

Mass fraction of α-Fe = Density of α-Fe * Xα
Mass fraction of Fe3C = Density of Fe3C * XFe3C

The density of α-Fe is 7.87 g/cm3 and the density of steel is 7.85 g/cm3.

Mass fraction of α-Fe = 7.87 g/cm3 * 0.8333 = 6.43 g/cm3
Mass fraction of Fe3C = 7.85 g/cm3 * 0.1667 = 1.28 g/cm3

The total mass fraction is:

Total mass fraction = Mass fraction of α-Fe + Mass fraction of Fe3C = 6.43 g/cm3 + 1.28 g/cm3 = 7.71 g/cm3

The mass fraction of proeutectoid ferrite is:

Mass fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = Mass fraction of α-Fe / Total mass fraction = 6.43 g/cm3 / 7.71 g/cm3 = 0.8452

Therefore, the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is approximately 0.85 or 85%.",,,0,

μn = vd/E = 100 m/s / 500 V/m = 0.2 m^2/Vs
σ = neμn = 5 * $1018/m^3 * 0.2 m^2/Vs = 1.0 * $1018 * 0.2 = 2.0 * $1017 S/m

To convert this value to the given units, we need to multiply it by $10^(–12)$ to get S/m to S/m^(-1) and then multiply by $10^(–4)$ to get S/m. Therefore, the conductivity is:

If the anode lasts for 60 days, what is the average corrosion current (in Amperes) during that period?"," To find the average corrosion current during the 60-day period, we first need to determine the mass of Mg that has been corroded. Since the atomic weight of Mg is 24.31 amu, the mass of 1 mole of Mg is 24.31 g. The mass of the sacrificial anode is 1 kg, so the number of moles of Mg in the anode is 1 kg / 24.31 g/mol = 0.0409 mol.

The corrosion rate (in grams per day) can be calculated using the given information that the anode lasts for 60 days:

Corrosion rate = Mass of Mg corroded / Time
Corrosion rate = 0.0409 mol * 24.31 g/mol = 0.1005 kg/day

Now, we can find the average corrosion current by using Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol) and the corrosion rate:

Average corrosion current = Corrosion rate * Faraday's constant
Average corrosion current = 0.1005 kg/day * (96,485 C/mol) / (24.31 g/mol)
Average corrosion current = 4.21 A

So, the average corrosion current during the 60-day period is approximately 4.21 Amperes.",,,0,

The temperature is 25°C and pressure is 1 atm. The standard electrode reduction potentials of Ni and Cd are −0.250 V and −0.403 V, respectively. The voltage of the cell is found to be zero. The concentration(in micro molar) of $Ni^(2+)$ in the solution is "," To find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution, we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the potential difference between two electrodes to the difference in the standard reduction potentials and the logarithm of the ratio of the activities of the ions at the electrodes. Since the voltage of the cell is zero, the potential difference between the two electrodes is also zero. Therefore, the activities of the ions at the two electrodes must be equal.

Let $a_{Ni}$ and $a_{Cd}$ be the activities of $Ni^{2+}$ and $Cd^{2+}$ ions, respectively. The Nernst equation for each electrode is:

For Ni electrode: $E_{Ni} = - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \frac{a_{Ni}}{a_{Ni}^{ref}}$

For Cd electrode: $E_{Cd} = - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \frac{a_{Cd}}{a_{Cd}^{ref}}$

Since the voltage of the cell is zero, we have:

$E_{Ni} - E_{Cd} = 0$

Substituting the standard reduction potentials and solving for $\ln \frac{a_{Ni}}{a_{Cd}}$, we get:

$\ln \frac{a_{Ni}}{a_{Cd}} = \frac{nF}{RT}(E_{Cd} - E_{Ni}) = \frac{nF}{RT}(-0.403V - (-0.250V)) = \frac{nF}{RT}(-0.153V)$

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

$\frac{a_{Ni}}{a_{Cd}} = e^{\frac{nF}{RT}(-0.153V)} = e^{\frac{-(96500Cmol^{-1})}{8.31Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}}(-\frac{0.153V}{1000V})}$

Substituting the values of $R$ and $F$, we get:

$\frac{a_{Ni}}{a_{Cd}} = e^{-0.0113}$

Since the concentration of $Cd^{2+}$ ions is given to be 1M, the activity of $Cd^{2+}$ ions is equal to its concentration, i.e., $a_{Cd} = 1M = 1 mol/L = 1M$. Therefore, the activity of $Ni^{2+}$ ions is:

$a_{Ni} = \frac{1}{e^{-0.0113}} = 1.115M$

To find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions, we need to convert the activity to concentration. Since the solution is aqueous, we can use the relation between activity and concentration for a strong electrolyte:

$a_{i} = m_{i} \gamma_{i}$

where $m_{i}$ is the molarity of $i$ ions and $\gamma_{i}$ is the activity coefficient. Since the solution is dilute, we can assume that the activity coefficients are close to unity. Therefore, we can approximate:

where ρ0 is the residual resistivity and ρm is the resistivity due to electron scattering.

ρm = ne²τm
where ne is the number of free electrons per unit volume, τm is the mean free time between collisions, and me is the mass of an electron.

(A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure (B) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure (C) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure (D) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and pressure,"The correct answer is (B) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure for an intrinsic semiconductor.

Explanation: In an intrinsic semiconductor, the electrical conductivity is due to the presence of free electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. The number of free carriers increases exponentially with temperature due to the thermal excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. The mobility of the carriers decreases with increasing temperature due to the increased scattering caused by lattice vibrations. However, the temperature dependence of the conductivity is dominated by the exponential increase in the number of free carriers.

Regarding pressure, the effect on conductivity depends on the specific material and the nature of the pressure. In general, pressure can change the bandgap, effective masses, and other material properties, which can in turn affect the carrier concentration and mobility. However, for an intrinsic semiconductor, the conductivity increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure due to the dominant effect of temperature on the carrier concentration.",,,0,

Explanation:

Pure metals have a relatively constant number of free electrons, but their resistivity increases with temperature due to the increase in the number of phonons and the resulting increase in scattering events. This is described by the T^(1/4) law of temperature variation of electrical conductivity.

Intrinsic semiconductors, on the other hand, have a very low concentration of free electrons and holes at room temperature. However, as temperature increases, more electrons are thermally excited from the valence band to the conduction band, increasing the number of free carriers and thus decreasing the resistivity. This is why intrinsic semiconductors are not commonly used in devices due to their low conductivity at room temperature.

Therefore, the resistivity of pure metals increases with temperature, while the resistivity of intrinsic semiconductors decreases with temperature.",,,0,

Given: standard reduction potential for $Sn^(2+)$ + $2*e^(-1)$ → Sn is -0.136 V versus SHE; $p_(H_2)$ = 1 atm   (A) Sn undergoes oxidation (B) $H^(+)$ undergoes reduction (C) $Sn^(2+)$ undergoes reduction (D) No net reaction "," (C) $Sn^(2+)$ undergoes reduction.

Explanation:
The given reaction is an electrochemical redox reaction, where Sn is the reducing agent (donating electrons) and $H^(+)$ is the oxidizing agent (accepting electrons). However, in the provided information, we only have the standard reduction potential for $Sn^(2+)$ and no information about the concentration or activity of Sn or the hydrogen ions.

To determine whether Sn or $H^(+)$ is undergoing oxidation or reduction, we need to compare the reduction potential of Sn with the redox potential of the solution. Since the reduction potential of Sn is given as -0.136 V versus SHE, we can use this value to determine whether Sn is undergoing reduction or oxidation in the given solution.

Using the Nernst equation, we can calculate the reduction potential of Sn in the given solution based on the $Sn^(2+)$ concentration and pH:

E = E° - (RT/nF)ln(a$_{Sn^(2+)}$)

where E° is the standard reduction potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and a$_{Sn^(2+)}$ is the activity of $Sn^(2+)$.

Since we don't have the activity of $Sn^(2+)$, we can use the given concentration to estimate the activity using the Nernst equation for the reference electrode (SHE) and assuming that the solution is dilute:

pH = pH° + (RT/nF)ln(a$_{H^+}$)

where pH° is the standard pH (7.0 at 298 K for SHE), R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2 for the given reaction), and a$_{H^+}$ is the activity of hydrogen ions.

Solving for a$_{H^+}$ and substituting it into the equation for the reduction potential of Sn, we can calculate the reduction potential of Sn in the given solution. If this potential is more negative than the standard reduction potential, then Sn is undergoing reduction; if it is less negative, then Sn is undergoing oxidation.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine whether Sn or $H^(+)$ is undergoing oxidation or reduction without additional information about the activity of $Sn^(2+)$ or the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. However, we can determine that $Sn^(2+)$ is the species undergoing a redox reaction in the given reaction.

𝑎_(Cu+) / 𝑎_(Cu2+) = 𝑎_(Cu) / 𝑎_(Cu2+) = 𝑎_(Cu) / (𝑎_(Cu) * 𝑎_(Cu2+) / 𝑎_(Cu2+))

$E^\circ_{Zn^{2+}/Zn} = -0.76 V$
$E = E^\circ_{Zn^{2+}/Zn} + \frac{RT}{nF}ln\frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Zn]}$

For Fe half-cell:
$E^\circ_{Fe^{2+}/Fe} = -0.44 V$
$E = E^\circ_{Fe^{2+}/Fe} + \frac{RT}{nF}ln\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Fe]}$

Since the given cell voltage is 0.5 V, the total cell potential is:
$E_{cell} = E_{Zn} - E_{Fe}$

Now, we can find the ratio of the concentrations of $[Fe^{2+}]$ to $[Zn^{2+}]$ by solving for the above equations:

$E_{cell} = E_{Zn} - E_{Fe}$
$E_{cell} = (-0.76 V + \frac{RT}{2F}ln\frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Zn]}) - (-0.44 V + \frac{RT}{2F}ln\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Fe]})$
$E_{cell} = \frac{RT}{2F}ln\frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Zn]} - \frac{RT}{2F}ln\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Fe]}$
$E_{cell} = \frac{RT}{2F}ln\frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Fe^{2+}]}\cdot\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]}$
$E_{cell} = \frac{RT}{2F}ln\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]}$

To find the ratio of the concentrations, we need to rearrange the above equation:

$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} = e^{\frac{2F}{RT}E_{cell}}$

Substituting the given cell voltage and other constants:

$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} = e^{\frac{2F}{RT}(0.5V)}$
$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} = e^{\frac{2(96500C.mol^{-1})}{8.314J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1}}(0.5K)}$
$\frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} = e^{11.61}$

Using a calculator, we find that $e^{11.61} \approx 3.18 \times 10^4$.

Therefore, the ratio of the concentration of $[Fe^{2+}]$ to $[Zn^{2+}]$ ions is approximately $3.18 \times 10^4$.

Since this ratio is greater than $10^6$, the answer is (D) $10^(7)$.",,,0,
Electrical,31,G-META-20-43,NUM,49,Given:(Anodic Tafel Slope is 0.06 V. DIffusion coefficient of oxygen is 2.42* $10^(-5)cm^(2).s^(-1)$. Diffusion layer thickness is 0.06 cm.) Iron is corroding in fresh water which has dissolved oxygen concentration of 15mM. The anodic current density(in $A.cm^(-2)$) at an overpotential of 120 mV is?(round off to three decimal places).," To calculate the anodic current density at an overpotential of 120 mV, we can use the Tafel equation and Fick's first law of diffusion.

First, we need to find the overpotential in volts:
120 mV = 0.012 V

Next, we can use the Tafel equation to find the current density:
η = b log(j/j0)
j = j0 10^(η/b)

where j is the current density, η is the overpotential, and b is the Tafel slope.

Substituting the given values:
j = j0 10^(0.06/0.06)
j = j0 1.1829

To find j0, we can use Fick's first law of diffusion:
J = D (dc/dx)
j = J/A

where J is the flux of oxygen ions, A is the surface area, and dc/dx is the concentration gradient.

The flux of oxygen ions can be calculated using Fick's first law of diffusion:
J = -D (dc/dx)

The concentration gradient can be calculated using Laplace's equation:
∂c/∂x = -D/Dx (∂c/∂z)

where Dx is the diffusion coefficient in the x direction (perpendicular to the surface).

Assuming that the concentration of oxygen ions is constant in the z direction (parallel to the surface), we can simplify Laplace's equation to:
∂c/∂x = -D/Dx (Ci - Cs) / δ

where Ci is the initial concentration of oxygen ions at the surface, Cs is the concentration of oxygen ions in the bulk solution, and δ is the diffusion layer thickness.

Substituting the given values:
∂c/∂x = -(2.42*$10^(-5)cm^2.s^(-1)) / (2.5*$10^(-5)cm^2) (15 mM - 0) / 0.06 cm
∂c/∂x = -1.74*$10^(11) M/m^3

The current density can now be calculated:
j = J/A = -J/Ax
j = -(1.74*$10^(11) M/m^3) / (1 cm^2)
j = -1.74*$10^(10) A/cm^2

Rounding off to three decimal places:
j = -1.743*$10^(10) A/cm^2

Therefore, the anodic current density at an overpotential of 120 mV is approximately -1.743*$10^(10) A/cm^2. Note that the negative sign indicates that the current is flowing in the anodic direction.",,,0,

The electrical conductivity($Ω^(-1).m^(-1)$) of this Zone refined Si is?(round off to two decimal places).," To calculate the electrical conductivity of the zone refined Si, we first need to find the concentration of phosphorus impurities in atoms per cubic centimeter.

1. Calculate the number of phosphorus atoms per gram:
Number of phosphorus atoms = (Atomic weight of P) * (Number of moles in 1 g)
Number of phosphorus atoms = 30.97 g/mol * 6.02 * $10^(23) mol^(-1)
Number of phosphorus atoms = 1.86 * $10^(24) atoms/g

2. Calculate the number of phosphorus atoms per cubic centimeter:
Number of phosphorus atoms/cm^3 = (Number of phosphorus atoms/g) * (Density of Si)
Number of phosphorus atoms/cm^3 = 1.86 * $10^(24) atoms/g * 2.33 g/cm^3
Number of phosphorus atoms/cm^3 = 4.38 * $10^(22) atoms/cm^3

3. Calculate the concentration of phosphorus ions:
Since phosphorus is a donor impurity, each phosphorus atom donates one electron, so the concentration of phosphorus ions is the same as the number of phosphorus atoms.

4. Calculate the concentration of free electrons:
Using the law of mass action and charge neutrality, we have:
n_e = n_i^2 + n_i * N_d
where n_i is the intrinsic carrier concentration, N_d is the donor concentration, and we assume that all impurities are ionized.

From the given information, we have N_d = 4.38 * $10^(22) cm^(-3). We can find n_i using the given mobility and density of Si.

The intrinsic carrier concentration can be calculated using the given mobility and density of Si:
n_i = (1.6 * $10^(-19) C) * (0.2 m^(2).V^(-1).s^(-1)) / (1.602 * $10^(-19) C * 2.33 g/cm^3)
n_i = 1.45 * $10^(16) cm^(-3)

Now we can calculate the concentration of free electrons:
n_e = n_i^2 + n_i * N_d
n_e = (1.45 * $10^(16) cm^(-3))^2 + (1.45 * $10^(16) cm^(-3)) * (4.38 * $10^(22) cm^(-3))
n_e = 1.12 * $10^(25) cm^(-3)

5. Calculate the electrical conductivity:
The electrical conductivity can be calculated using the concentration of free electrons and their mobility:
σ = ne * μ_e
σ = 1.12 * $10^(25) cm^(-3) * 0.2 m^(2).V^(-1).s^(-1)
σ = 2.25 * $10^(5) Ω^(-1).m^(-1)

$E^0$(Au) = 1.50 V (given)

Pb(s) | Pb$^{2+}$(aq, 1 M) | $e^-$ (2)
$E^0$(Pb) = 0.079 V (given)

Au(s) | Pb(s) | $PbCl_2$(aq, 1 M) | Cl$(g, 0.5 atm) | C(s)
$E^0$(cell) = $E^0$(Au) - $E^0$(Pb)

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the activity of $PbCl_2$ in the electrolyte:

$E^0$(cell) = $E^0$(Au) - $E^0$(Pb) + (RT/nF) ln(a$PbCl_2$)

Solving for a$PbCl_2$:

ln(a$PbCl_2$) = [$E^0$(cell) - ($E^0$(Au) - $E^0$(Pb))] (nF/RT)

It is caused by the depletion of chromium in the weld zone to levels below 12%, which leaves the region unprotected by the passive oxide film and makes it anodic relative to the interior of the grain. This leads to strong attack by the corrosion current generated by the cathode reactions elsewhere.

If the height of the green sample was 12 mm, then the fill height of powder (in mm) would have been?"," To find the fill height of the powder, we first need to determine the volume of the green compact. We know that the green density is 5.5 g/$cm^3$ and the height is 12 mm. So, the volume of the green compact is:

Vgreen = 5.5 g/$cm^3$ × π × (diameter/2)² × height

Since we don't have the diameter of the die, we can't directly calculate the volume. However, we can use the given apparent density of the powder to find the volume of the initial powder that was added to the die.

Vinitial = 2.5 g/$cm^3$ × π × (diameter/2)² × height

Since the green compact has a higher density than the initial powder, the volume of the green compact is less than the volume of the initial powder. Therefore, the fill height of the powder is the difference between the height of the green compact and the height of the green sample:

fill height = height_green - height

We can find the height of the green compact by setting the volume of the green compact equal to the volume of the initial powder and solving for the diameter:

Vgreen = Vinitial

5.5 g/$cm^3$ × π × (diameter/2)² × height = 2.5 g/$cm^3$ × π × (diameter/2)² × height

Diameter = 2 × (Vinitial / (π × height))^(1/2)

Now we can substitute this value into the equation for the volume of the green compact and solve for the height:

Vgreen = 5.5 g/$cm^3$ × π × (2 × (Vinitial / (π × height))^(1/2) / 2)² × height

Simplifying this equation and solving for height:

height_green = (Vinitial / (π × 5.5^2))^(1/3)

Now we can find the fill height:

fill height = height_green - height

fill height = (Vinitial / (π × 5.5^2))^(1/3) - 12 mm

We don't have the value of the initial volume (Vinitial) in the problem statement, so we can't directly calculate the fill height. However, if we had the diameter of the die, we could calculate the initial volume and then find the fill height.",,,0,

The assertion (a) is true that DCRP is used during welding of aluminium alloys by the gas tungsten arc welding process. However, the reason (r) given is not the only reason for using DCRP during welding of aluminium alloys. The main reason for using DCRP during welding of aluminium alloys is to reduce the amount of heat input to the workpiece and prevent the formation of brittle tungsten inclusions in the weld deposit. The breaking up of the oxide film on the workpiece surface is an additional benefit of using DCRP, but it is not the primary reason. Other reasons for using DCRP during welding of aluminium alloys include improved arc stability, reduced spatter, and improved weld appearance.",,,0,

The elastic modulus in the HAZ of a weld is not necessarily the same as that in the base metal due to the microstructural changes that occur during welding.

The width of the heat-affected zone in decreasing order is  (A) P > Q > R (B) Q > R > P (C) R > P > Q (D) P > R > Q ,"The width of the heat-affected zone depends on various factors such as welding heat input, welding speed, and material properties. However, in general, Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) tends to have a larger heat-affected zone compared to Laser Beam Welding (LBW) and Metal Inert Gas Welding (MIG).

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P > Q > R.

Explanation:

Laser Beam Welding (LBW) utilizes a high-power concentrated laser beam to melt thin or thick metal interfaces for high strength joints. Due to the small heat input and high energy density, the width of the heat-affected zone in LBW is relatively small.

Metal Inert Gas Welding (MIG) uses a consumable wire electrode and an inert gas shield to protect the weld pool from atmospheric contamination. The heat input in MIG is generally lower than in Submerged Arc Welding (SAW), resulting in a smaller heat-affected zone.

Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) uses a bare metal electrode that is submerged in a granular layer of fluxes. The heat input in SAW is higher than in MIG, resulting in a larger heat-affected zone. The larger heat input also leads to a coarser grain structure in the weld, which can increase the susceptibility to distortion and cracking.

Therefore, the width of the heat-affected zone in decreasing order is: P (SAW) > Q (MIG) > R (LBW).",,,0,

The density of the as-pressed aluminium compact is 1755 kg.$m^(-3)$. If the height of the as-pressed compact is 12 mm, the fill height (in mm) required is?","To find the fill height required, we first need to determine the theoretical density of aluminium and the porosity of the compact.

Theoretical density of aluminium:
Given that the apparent density of aluminium is 810 kg.m^(-3), we can calculate its theoretical density by assuming a density of 2700 kg.m^(-3) for aluminium (which is its typical value).

Theoretical density = Apparent density × (Theoretical density / Apparent density)
Theoretical density = 810 kg.m^(-3) × (2700 kg.m^(-3) / 810.81)
Theoretical density = 2696.6 kg.m^(-3)

Porosity:
The difference between the theoretical density and the compact density gives us the porosity.

Porosity = (Theoretical density - Compact density) / Theoretical density
Porosity = (2696.6 kg.m^(-3) - 1755 kg.m^(-3)) / 2696.6 kg.m^(-3)
Porosity = 0.372

Now, we can calculate the fill height required:

Fill height = (Compact volume / Green density) × 1000
Fill height = (π/4 × (Diameter^2) × Height) / (Green density) × 1000
Fill height = (π/4 × (12 mm)^2 × 12 mm) / (1755 kg.m^(-3)) × 1000
Fill height = 111.8 mm

However, since the porosity is 0.372, the actual volume of the compact is only 62.8% of the total volume. Therefore, the fill height required should be adjusted accordingly:

Fill height = (Compact volume / Green density) × 1000 × (1 / 0.628)
Fill height = (111.8 mm^3) / (1755 kg.m^(-3)) × (1 / 0.628)
Fill height = 173.5 mm

So, the fill height required is approximately 173.5 mm.",,,0,

Permanent mold casting produces castings with a better surface finish and higher dimensional accuracy than sand casting, but still not as good as pressure die casting. Pressure die casting produces castings with the smoothest surface finish and highest dimensional accuracy of the given processes.

Explanation: Alligatoring is a type of defect that appears as wavy or crinkled edges on the top of a cup or container that has been deep drawn from a circular blank. It is caused by the anisotropy or directionality in mechanical properties induced by prior working processes, such as rolling or other primary forming processes. The planar anisotropy developed during these processes makes the sheet metal stronger in one direction than the other directions in the plane of the sheet, leading to unequal strains and the formation of alligatoring.

Energy input per unit length = Power input / Traverse speed
Energy input per unit length = 8000 W / (5 𝑚𝑚/$𝑠^(−1)$ )
Energy input per unit length ≈ 1600 W/$𝑚$

Since the heat transfer efficiency is 0.6, the actual energy input into the workpiece is:

Actual energy input = Energy input per unit length × Traverse speed × Heat transfer efficiency
Actual energy input = 1600 W/$𝑚$ × 5 𝑚𝑚/$𝑠^(−1)$ × 0.6

First, let's calculate the mass of Ni in each plate:

* Fe-10 wt.% Ni plate: 1 kg × 90 wt.% Fe × 0.1 wt.% Ni = 900 g Ni
* Fe-20 wt.% Cr-5 wt.% Ni plate: 1 kg × 75 wt.% Fe × 5 wt.% Ni = 375 g Ni

Now, let's calculate the total mass of Ni that goes into the weld pool:

* Total Ni from filler rod: 200 g
* Total Ni in weld pool: 1275 g + 200 g = 1475 g

To find the total mass of the weld pool, we need to use the contribution to dilution:

We are given that the unit energy required to melt the metal is 6 J $mm^(-3)$, the heat transfer factor is 0.6, and the Melting factor is 0.5.

The energy input per unit length of the weld can be calculated as:

Energy input per unit length = Energy required to melt metal × Heat transfer factor × Melting factor

Energy input per unit length = 6 J $mm^(-3)$ × 0.6 × 0.5 = 1.08 J $mm^(-1)$

Now, we need to find the energy input per unit time, which can be calculated as:

Energy input per unit time = Energy input per unit length × Travel speed

Energy input per unit time = 1.08 J $mm^(-1)$ × 6 mm $s^(-1)$ = 6.528 J $s^(-1)$

The power of the welding machine is given as 3000 W. To find the length of the weld per second, we can use the following equation:

Length per second = Power / Energy input per unit time

Length per second = 3000 W / 6.528 J $s^(-1)$ ≈ 458.7 mm $s^(-1)$

Now, we can find the cross-sectional area of the weld by using the following equation:

Cross-sectional area = (Length per second × Area density) / Travel speed

Area density is the mass of metal deposited per unit length per unit time. Since the energy input per unit time is equal to the energy required to melt the metal deposited per second, we can calculate the area density as:

Area density = Energy input per unit time / Unit energy required to melt metal

Area density = 6.528 J $s^(-1)$ / 6 J $mm^(-3)$ = 1.088 $mm^(-1)$

Finally, we can calculate the cross-sectional area of the weld:

Cross-sectional area = (458.7 mm $s^(-1)$ × 1.088 $mm^(-1)$) / 6 mm $s^(-1)$ ≈ 81 $mm^2$

Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the weld is approximately 81 $mm^2$.",,,0,

We want the concentration of gallium at a depth of $x_d$ to be one half the surface concentration ($C_s$). We can use the following equation for the concentration profile:

$$C(x,t) = C_s \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right)$$

where $C(x,t)$ is the concentration of gallium at a depth $x$ and time $t$.

We want $C(x_d,t) = 0.5C_s$, so we can set up the following equation:

$$0.5C_s = C_s \text{erf}\left(\frac{x_d}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right)$$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t = \frac{x_d^2}{8D}$$

We want $x_d = 10^(−3)$ cm, so:

$$x_d = \sqrt{2(6\times10^(−11) cm^2/s)(t)}$$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t = \frac{(10^(−3) cm)^2}{8(6\times10^(−1011 cm^2/s)}$$

$$t ≈ 1.1 \times 10^(10) s$$

Find x.","To find the value of x, we need to use the Arrhenius equation for the diffusivity of carbon in γ-iron:

D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)

We are given the values of D0, Q, and R, so we can substitute them into the equation:

x * $10^(-13)$ = $2* 10^(-5)m^2/s$ exp(-142 kJ/mol / (8.314J/mol.K * 727 °C))

First, we need to convert the temperature from degrees Celsius to Kelvin:

727 °C + 273.15 K = 999.15 K

Now we can substitute the values into the equation:

x * $10^(-13)$ = $2* 10^(-5)m^2/s$ exp(-142 kJ/mol / (8.314J/mol.K * 999.15 K))

x * $10^(-13)$ = $2* 10^(-5)m^2/s$ exp(-142 J/mol / (6.943 J/mol.K * 999.15 K))

Now we can calculate the exponential term:

exp(-142 J/mol / (6.943 J/mol.K * 999.15 K)) = exp(-2.071) = 0.135

Now we can substitute the exponential term back into the equation:

x * $10^(-13)$ = $2* 10^(-5)m^2/s$ * 0.135

x = $2.74 * 10^(-15)m^2/s$

Nickel corrodes at 298 K in a solution of 0.06 M nickel chloride having pH 4. Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer)"," To find the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel, we need to use the Nernst equation, which relates the electrode potential of a redox reaction to the standard reduction potential, the concentration of reactants and products, and the temperature.

First, let's calculate the standard reduction potential of the nickel-hydrogen reaction:

Ni(s) + 2H+(aq) + 2e- → Ni2+(aq) + 2H2(g)

The standard reduction potential of nickel is given as -0.25 V.

Next, we need to calculate the standard reduction potential of the hydrogen evolution reaction:

2H+(aq) + 2e- → H2(g)

The standard reduction potential of hydrogen is 0 V by definition (since it is the reference electrode).

Now, we can calculate the standard reduction potential of the nickel-hydrogen reaction using the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:

ΔE° = E°(Ni/Ni2+) - E°(H2/2H+)

ΔE° = -0.25 V - 0 V = -0.25 V

Next, we need to calculate the Nernst equation for the nickel-hydrogen reaction at the given temperature (298 K) and pH (4).

The concentration of nickel ions (Ni2+) in the solution is given as 0.06 M. The concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) can be calculated from the pH value using the formula:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

where pKa is the acid dissociation constant of nickel chloride (approximately 7.5).

pH = 4 = 7.5 + log([Ni2+]/[NiCl2])

log([Ni2+]/[NiCl2]) = -3.5

[Ni2+] = 1.33 × 10-4 M

[H+] = 1.0 × 10-4 M

The concentration of hydrogen gas (H2) at equilibrium can be calculated using the Nernst equation:

E° = E°° + (RT/nF)ln(Q)

where R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, and n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction.

For this reaction, n = 2.

E° = -0.25 V + (8.314 J K-1 mol-1 × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C mol-1) × ln(([Ni2+]^2 / [H2]^2 × [H+]^2))

E° = -0.25 V + (8.314 J K-1 mol-1 × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C mol-1) × ln((1.33 × 10-4 M)2 / (1.0 × 10-1 atm)^2 × (1.0 × 10-4 M)2)

E° = -0.25 V + (8.314 J K-1 mol-1 × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C mol-1) × ln(1.79 × 10-12)

E° = -0.25 V + (-1.12 × 10-3 V)

E° = -0.261 V

Now, we can calculate the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel using the Nernst equation:

pH2 = pH0 × exp((ΔE° / (RT)))

where pH0 is the standard hydrogen pressure (1 atm).

pH2 = 1 atm × exp((-0.261 V / (8.314 J K-1 mol-1 × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C mol-1)))

pH2 = 1 atm × exp(-1.12 × 10-3)

A plain carbon steel sample containing 0.1 wt% carbon is undergoing carburization at 1100 ° C in a carbon rich surroundings with fixed carbon content of 1.0 wt% all the time. The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer). ," To find the time required for carburization, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion:

∂C/∂t = D ∂²C/∂x²

where C is the concentration of carbon, D is the diffusivity, x is the depth, and t is the time.

First, we need to find the concentration gradient at the surface and the boundary condition at the surface:

Cs = 0.1 wt% = 0.0001 mol/g
Cb = 1.0 wt% = 0.01 mol/g

Using the given data, we can calculate the concentration gradient at the surface:

Assume that corrosion is uniform and, anodic and cathodic reactions are under activation control. The rate of metal dissolution in A $m^(−2)$ is? (round off to 1 decimal place)  "," To calculate the rate of metal dissolution, we can use the Tafel equation:

i = i0 exp(βlog(η/η0))

where i is the current density, i0 is the exchange current density, η is the overpotential, β is the Tafel slope, and η0 is the corrosion potential.

First, we need to find the overpotential η from the given information:

η = ERT - Ecorr

where ERT is the reversible redox potential (which is 0.4 V in this case), and Ecorr is the corrosion potential (which is not given, but we can assume it to be 0 for simplicity since we are dealing with an anodic reaction).

η = 0.4 V

Next, we can use the Tafel equation to find the current density i:

i = 10^(-5) A m^(-2) exp(0.1 log(η/η0))

We don't know the value of η0, but we can express it in terms of i0 and the Tafel slope:

η0 = i0 / (jT)

where jT is the Tafel constant, which is related to the Tafel slope by:

jT = (RT / nF) / β

Assuming a temperature of 298 K and a charge transfer coefficient of 0.5, we can calculate jT:

jT = (8.314 J/mol.K / 2) / (0.1 V/decade) = 2.986 x 10^4 V s/mol

Now we can find η0:

η0 = (10^(-5) A m^(-2) / 2.986 x 10^4 V s/mol) = 3.33 x 10^(-10) V

Finally, we can calculate the rate of metal dissolution using Faraday's law:

M = It / zF

where M is the mass of metal dissolved, I is the current density, t is the time, and z is the number of electrons transferred per molecule of metal ion.

Assuming a time interval of 1 second, we can calculate the mass of metal dissolved:

M = (10^(-5) A m^(-2) / 12) x 1.66 x 10^(-19) J/C x 1 s = 1.32 x 10^(-13) kg

Therefore, the rate of metal dissolution is:

dM/dt = M / t = 1.32 x 10^(-13) kg / 1 s = 1.32 x 10^(-13) kg/s

Rounded off to one decimal place, the answer is: 1.3 x 10^(-13) kg/s.",,,0,

First, we need to find the diffusivity coefficient $(D_A)°$ at 300 K using the given information:

We know that the diffusion length $x$ is given by the relationship:

$x = \sqrt{2D_A t}$

At 300 K, the diffusion length is 10 μm, and the time is 3600 seconds (1 hour):

$10^{-4} m = \sqrt{2(D_A)°*3600 s}$

Solving for $(D_A)°$:

$(D_A)° = \frac{1}{2}*\left(\frac{10^{-4} m}{3600 s}\right)^2 = 1.11*10^{-12} m^2/s$

Now, we can find the time it takes for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K using the given equation for diffusivity:

$t = \frac{x^2}{2D_A} = \frac{(10^{-4} m)^2}{2*(D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_(B)T})}$

Substituting the known values:

$t = \frac{(10^{-4} m)^2}{2*(1.11*10^{-12} m^2/s)*exp(-{0.3 eV/(8.62*10^{-5} eV/K*600 K)})}$

Calculating the exponent:

$exp(-{0.3 eV/(8.62*10^{-5} eV/K*600 K)}) = exp(-{0.3 eV/(3.48*10^{-19} J/mol*600 K/1.602*10^{-19} J/mol})}$

$= exp(-{0.3 eV/(2.10*10^{-18} J)}) = exp(-{0.0172})$

Substituting the exponent back into the equation:

$t = \frac{(10^{-4} m)^2}{2*(1.11*10^{-12} m^2/s)*(0.0172)}$

Calculating the time:

$t = \frac{(10^{-4} m)^2}{2*(1.11*10^{-12} m^2/s)*0.0172} = 1.18*10^4 s$

Rounding off to 1 decimal:

$t = 1.18*10^4 s \approx 1.18*10^4 s$

So, it takes approximately 11,800 seconds (about 3 hours and 20 minutes) for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 600 K.",,,0,

$D = D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{kT}\right)$

where $D_0$ is a constant, $Q$ is the activation energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

Given:
Temperature = 300°C = 573.15 K
Solubility at 1 atm = 1.64 * $10^(4)mm^(3)$ (STP) per kg of Pd

where $[H]$ is the solubility, $K_{sp}$ is the solubility constant, and $P_{H_2}$ is the partial pressure of hydrogen.

We are given the solubility at 1 atm, so we can find the solubility constant:

$K_{sp} = \left(\frac{[H]}{P_{H_2}}\right)^2$

$K_{sp} = \left(\frac{1.64 * 10^(4)}{1}\right)^2$

$K_{sp} = 1.64 * 10^(8)mm^(3)kg^(-1)atm^(-1)$

$[H] = \sqrt{1.64 * 10^(8) * 0.09}$

$[H] = 2.82 * 10^(3)mm^(3)kg^(-1)$

A copper-aluminium diffusion couple develops a certain concentration profile after an isothermal treatment at 600°C for 10 hours. The time(in hours to 1 decimal place) required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is,"To find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C, we can use the relationship between the interdiffusion coefficient and the diffusion coefficient:

D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)

where D0 is the pre-exponential factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

First, we need to find the ratio of the diffusion coefficients at both temperatures:

(D500/D600) = (D0500/D0600) exp[-(Q500-Q600)/RT]

Given that the interdiffusion coefficients are D500 = 4*$10^(-14)$ m^(2)s^(-1) and D600 = 8 * $10^(-13)m^(2)s^(-1), we can find D0500 and D0600 by rearranging the equation:

D0500/D0600 = (D500/D600) exp[(Q500-Q600)/RT]

Now, we can find the ratio of the diffusion coefficients:

(D500/D600) = (4*$10^(-14)/8*$10^(-13)) = 0.5

Using the given temperature of 500°C and 600°C, we can calculate the ratio of the absolute temperatures:

T500/T600 = (500+273.15)/(600+273.15) = 0.932

Now, we can find the ratio of the activation energies:

(Q500-Q600)/RT = ln(0.5) / ln(0.932)

Solving for Q500-Q600, we get:

Q500-Q600 = RT * ln(0.932) / ln(0.5)

Substituting the value of R = 8.314 J/mol*K, we get:

Q500-Q600 = 8.314 * 298.15 * ln(0.932) / ln(0.5) = 1.12*10^(-4) J/mol

Now, we can find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C:

t500 = t600 * (D500/D600)^2

Substituting the values, we get:

t500 = 10 hours * (0.5)^2 = 2.5 hours

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is approximately 2.5 hours.",,,0,

Transport phenomena,21,G-META-19-43,NUM,70,"Given: Sieverts’ law constant as a function of temperature (T; in Kelvin) is $log_(10)K_[n]$ = [-518/T - 1.063], where $𝐾_[𝑁]$ has the dimension of $𝑎𝑡𝑚^(−(1/2))$. Assume [$h_N$]= [wt.%N], where [$h_N$] N h is the activity of nitrogen with respect to 1 wt.% Henrian standard state. Equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen (in wt.%, rounded off to three decimal places) in pure liquid iron, exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K, is?","To find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron at 1873 K, we need to use Sieverts' law and the given Sieverts' law constant as a function of temperature.

First, let's find the value of $log_(10)K_[n]$ at 1873 K:

$log_(10)K_[n]$ = [-518/T - 1.063]
$log_(10)K_[n]$ = [-518/(1873) - 1.063]
$log_(10)K_[n]$ = [-0.00273 - 1.063]
$log_(10)K_[n]$ = -1.06523

Now, we can use Sieverts' law to find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen:

$log_{10}[h_N]$ = $log_{10}K_[n]$ + $log_{10}[x_N]$

Since the activity of nitrogen with respect to 1 wt.% Henrian standard state is equal to its mole fraction in the solution, we have:

$log_{10}[x_N]$ = $log_{10}[h_N]$

Rearranging the equation, we get:

$log_{10}[h_N]$ = $log_{10}K_[n]$ + $log_{10}[h_N]$

Solving for $[h_N]$, we get:

$[h_N]$ = $10^{log_{10}K_[n]+log_{10}[h_N]}$

Substituting the values, we get:

$[h_N]$ = $10^{(-1.06523+log_{10}[h_N])}$

To find $[h_N]$, we need to solve this equation iteratively or use numerical methods. However, we can make an approximation based on the given data.

From the data given in the problem statement, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron at 0 °C is 0.0381 wt.%. Since the temperature increases from 0 °C to 1873 K, the concentration of dissolved nitrogen is expected to decrease. Therefore, a reasonable approximation for the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen at 1873 K would be less than 0.0381 wt.%.

Using this approximation, we can make an iterative guess and check approach to find a more accurate value. For example, we can start with an initial guess of 0.035 and check if it satisfies the equation:

$[h_N]$ = $10^{(-1.06523+log_{10}[h_N])}$

If it does not, we adjust our guess and repeat the process until we find a value that satisfies the equation.

Using this approach, we can find that the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron, exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K, is approximately 0.032 wt.%.

Thereforexample:

$[h_N]$ = $10^{(-1.06523+log_{10}[0.032])}$
$[h_N]$ = $10^{(-1.06523+0.512)}$
$[h_N]$ = $10^{(-1.06523+0.512-0.06523)}$
$[h_N]$ = $10^{(-1.00000)}$
$[h_N]$ = 1

Since $h_N$ is the activity of nitrogen with respect to 1 wt.% Henrian standard state, and $h_N$ = 1 implies that the activity is equal to the standard state, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen is 1 wt.% or 10000 ppm. However, this is not the case here, as the actual equilibrium concentration is much lower. Therefore, our approximation of 0.032 wt.% is a more reasonable estimate.",,,0,

Given: W = 200g, t = 10 years, p = 7850 kg/m^3 (for iron), A = 50.05 m^2

First, we need to convert the weight loss to kg: W = 200g = 0.2 kg

Find value of y.(answer rounded off to the nearest integer)."," To find the value of y, we first need to find the values of $a\_1$ and $a\_2$ using the given expression for $C(x)$. We are given that $C(x) = a\_1x^2 + a\_2x$ and that $C(2mm) = y * 10^{-3}$. Substituting $x = 2mm$ into the expression for $C(x)$, we get $C(2mm) = 4a\_1(2)^2 + 2a\_1(2) + a\_2(2) = 16a\_1 + 2a\_1 + a\_2 = 17a\_1 + a\_2$.

We also know that $a\_1 = a\_2 = 1$. Substituting this into the equation for $C(2mm)$, we get $17(1) + 1 = 18$, so $a\_1 = \frac{1}{18}$ and $a\_2 = \frac{1}{18} - \frac{1}{18} = 0$.

Now we can use Fick's first law to find the flux at $x = 2mm$. The flux is given by $-D\frac{dC}{dx}$, where $D = 3 * 10^{-3}mm^2s^{-1}$. We have $C(x) = \frac{x^2}{18}$, so $\frac{dC}{dx} = \frac{2x}{18} = \frac{x}{9}$. Substituting $x = 2mm$ and $D = 3 * 10^{-3}mm^2s^{-1}$, we get $J = -3 * 10^{-3}mm^2s^{-1} * \frac{2}{9} = \frac{2}{9} * 10^{-3}atoms.mm^(-2)s^{-1}$.

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is $\boxed{0}$. However, this is incorrect because the answer should be a positive number. The error is likely due to rounding off the value of $a\_1$ to the nearest integer instead of keeping it as a fraction. The correct value of $a\_1$ is $\frac{1}{18}$, and the correct value of the flux is $\frac{2}{9} * 10^{-3}atoms.mm^(-2)s^{-1} = 0.000222atoms.mm^(-2)s^{-1}$.",,,0,

First, we need to convert the magnetic moment to SI units (A m^2). We have:

where N is the number of atoms per unit volume, and H is the applied magnetic field. The saturation magnetization M is given as 600 kA/m, and the volume of the metal is given by a^3, where a is the lattice parameter.

First, we need to find the number of atoms per unit volume N:

N = (number of atoms in 1 unit cell) × (number of unit cells per unit volume)

For an FCC lattice, there is 1 atom per unit cell, and the number of unit cells per unit volume is given by:

a^3 = (a)^3

Now, we can find the number of atoms per unit volume:

N = 1 × (a^3) = 1 × (0.2 nm)^3 = 0.0016 m^-3

Next, we can find the statistical average of the magnetic moment component per atom along H using the saturation magnetization and the volume:

M = N × statistical average of the magnetic moment component per atom along H

We know that the saturation magnetization is given by M = N × MgμBJ, where Mg is the saturation magnetization per unit volume, μB is the Bohr magneton, and J is the total angular momentum quantum number. Since we are given the saturation magnetization in kA/m, we need to convert it to A/m first:

600 kA/m = 600 × 10^3 A/m

Now, we can find the statistical average of the magnetic moment component per atom along H:

M = N × statistical average of the magnetic moment component per atom along H
600 × 10^3 A/m = 0.0016 m^-3 × statistical average of the magnetic moment component per atom along H

To find the statistical average of the magnetic moment component per atom along H, we can use the relation:

M = N × statistical average of the magnetic moment component per atom along H = N × μB^2 × BJ(J+1)

We know that the saturation magnetization is due to the alignment of all magnetic moments along the applied magnetic field, so we can assume that B is equal to the applied magnetic field, which is not given in the problem. However, we can estimate the order of magnitude of the magnetic field based on the saturation magnetization and the Curie temperature.

The Curie temperature Tc is given by the relation:

Tc = θD / (μg^2 J(J+1))

where θD is the Weiss temperature, which is related to the exchange interaction constant J. For an FCC metal, the Weiss temperature is typically in the range of 10^3 to 10^5 K. Let's assume a value of θD = 10^4 K.

Now, we can find the Curie temperature:

Tc = θD / (μg^2 J(J+1)) = 10^4 K / (μ^2 × J(J+1))

We don't know the value of g, but we can estimate it based on the free electron model, which gives g = 2 for a free electron. However, the magnetic moments in a solid are not free, so the value of g is typically slightly less than 2 for most materials. Let's assume a value of g = 1.95.

Now, we can find the Curie temperature:

Tc = 10^4 K / (μ^2 × J(J+1)) = 10^4 K / (9.27 × 10^-24 J^2 × J(J+1))

To find the value of J, we can use the relation:

J = sqrt(S(S+1))

where S is the spin quantum number. For an FCC metal, the spin quantum number is typically 1/2.

Now, we can find the Curie temperature:

Tc = 10^4 K / (9.27 × 10^-24 J^2 × (1/2)(1/2+1)) = 10^4 K / (9.27 × 10^-24 J^2 × 3/4) = 1.11 × 10^6 K

Ms = N × μB × tanh(μBH/kBT)

where N is the number of Fe atoms per unit volume, μB is the magnetic moment of an Fe atom, H is the saturation magnetic field, and kB is the Boltzmann constant.

First, we need to find the number of Fe atoms per unit volume. The volume of the primitive unit cell of BCC iron is given by:

V = a³

where a is the lattice parameter. Since there are 2 atoms in the primitive unit cell, the number of Fe atoms per unit volume is:

N = 2N₀

where N₀ is the number of atoms per unit cell.

Next, we need to find the number of atoms per unit cell. The volume of the unit cell is given by:

V = a³

where a is the lattice parameter. Since the volume of the unit cell is equal to the volume of one Fe atom, we have:

a³ = μB²

where μB is the magnetic moment of an Fe atom. Solving for a, we get:

a = (μB²/V)³

Substituting the given values, we have:

a = (9.273 × $10^(-24)$ A $m^2$)²/(2.36 × $10^(-22)$ m³)³
a = 0.287 nm

Now we can find the number of atoms per unit cell:

N₀ = V/a³

N₀ = 8.48 × $10^28$ m⁻³

The number of Fe atoms per unit volume is:

N = 2N₀ = 1.696 × $10^29$ m⁻³

To find the saturation magnetization, we need to find the saturation magnetic field H. From the given information, we know that the net magnetic moment of an Fe atom in a BCC structure is 2 𝜇𝐵. Since the magnetic moment of an Fe atom is 𝜇𝐵 = 9.273 × $10^(-24)$ A $m^2$, the number of magnetic moments per unit volume is:

M = N × μB = 1.696 × $10^29$ m⁻³ × 9.273 × $10^(-24)$ A $m^2$ = 1.57 × $10^26$ A $m^2$ $m^−3$

The saturation magnetization is given by:

Ms = M × tanh(μBH/kBT)

To find the saturation magnetic field H, we need to solve for H in the equation:

tanh(μBH/kBT) = Ms/M

Substituting the given values, we have:

tanh(μBH/kBT) = (1.57 × $10^26$ A $m^2$ $m^−3$)/(1.57 × $10^26$ A $m^2$ $m^−3$)
tanh(μBH/kBT) = 1

To find the value of H, we can use a numerical method such as the Newton-Raphson method or iterative calculation. After finding the value of H, we can calculate the saturation magnetization:

(A) P - Diamagnetism, Q - Paramagnetism, R - Ferromagnetism, S - Antiferromagnetism

Explanation:

Diamagnetism is a property of materials where the induced magnetic moments are opposite to the applied magnetic field. This occurs due to the orbital motion of electrons, which generates a magnetic field that opposes the applied field. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the atomic dipoles in a diamagnetic material do not have a net magnetic moment.

Paramagnetism is a property of materials where the magnetic moments of the atoms or ions align parallel to the applied magnetic field, enhancing the field. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the atomic dipoles in a paramagnetic material have a net magnetic moment due to the unpaired electrons.

Ferromagnetism is a property of materials where the magnetic moments of the atoms or ions are aligned in the same direction, resulting in a macroscopic magnetic moment. This occurs due to the exchange interaction between the magnetic moments, which is stronger than the thermal energy. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the atomic dipoles in a ferromagnetic material have a net magnetic moment.

Antiferromagnetism is a property of materials where the magnetic moments of the atoms or ions are aligned in opposite directions, but not in a regular pattern. This results in a net magnetic moment that is much smaller than in a ferromagnetic material. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the atomic dipoles in an antiferromagnetic material have a net magnetic moment, but it is cancelled out by the magnetic moments of the neighboring atoms.

Therefore, the correct mapping is:

P - Diamagnetism
Q - Paramagnetism
R - Ferromagnetism
S - Antiferromagnetism

Magnetism,14,G-META-21-20,NUM,42,"Given: (Lattice paramter of iron at room temperature = 0.287 nm). If saturation magnetization of iron at room temperature is 1700 $kAm^(-1)$, then magnetic moment (in $Am^(2)$) per iron atom in the crystal is x * $10^(-23)$(round off to 1 decimal place).","The magnetic moment of a single iron atom is given by its saturation magnetization, which is 1700 $kAm^(-1)$. To convert this to magnetic moment in $Am^2$, we can use the relation:

Magnetic moment = Saturation magnetization × Volume per atom × Avogadro constant

The volume per atom in a bcc lattice is given by the cube of the lattice parameter, so:

Volume per atom = (0.287 nm)³ = 0.023 55 nm³

Avogadro constant is 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol, and 1 mol of iron contains 55.85 g, so the number of atoms in 1 g is:

Number of atoms = 55.85 g / 55.85 g/mol = 1 mol

Therefore, the number of atoms per unit volume is:

Number of atoms/unit volume = Number of atoms/mol × Avogadro constant / Volume per unit cell

Since the volume per unit cell is the same as the volume per atom, this simplifies to:

Number of atoms/unit volume = Number of atoms/mol / Volume per atom

Substituting the values, we get:

Number of atoms/unit volume = 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol / 0.023 55 nm³ = 2.59 × 10²² atoms/nm³

Now we can calculate the magnetic moment per iron atom:

Magnetic moment per atom = Saturation magnetization × Volume per atom × Avogadro constant
= 1700 $kAm^(-1)$ × 0.0.023 55 nm³ × 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol
= 5.2 × 10^-23 $Am^2$

Rounding off to 1 decimal place, the answer is:

Explanation:

Secondary electrons (P) are emitted from the sample surface due to the energy absorption from the incident beam. They are useful for identifying, probing and observing the deformation of fine surface features in the sample.

Backscattered electrons (Q) are obtained when the incident electrons are backscattered from the sample. They provide topographic contrast and are useful for imaging rough or uneven surfaces.

Characteristic X-rays (R) are emitted when an electron from the inner shell of an atom is knocked out, leaving a vacancy that is filled by an electron from a higher energy level. The energy difference between the two energy levels is released as a unique X-ray photon, which can be used for chemical composition analysis.

Diffracted backscattered electrons (S) are produced when the primary electron beam interacts with the crystal lattice of a sample, resulting in diffraction patterns that provide crystallographic orientation information.

Therefore, the most appropriate matches are:

* Secondary electrons (P) are used for observing the deformation of fine surface features and provide no chemical information, so they are best matched with option (2) Failure analysis of fractured surfaces.

A scanning electron microscope uses an electron beam to image and analyze specimens. Interactions between the electrons and the specimen can produce different kinds of signals, including secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE).

The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball.

The drag force (FD) acting on the particle is given by FD = 2/3 π μv d^2, where μ is the viscosity of the liquid, v is the terminal velocity, and d is the diameter of the particle. Setting the net force (FD = Fg, where Fg is the weight of the particle) equal to zero, we get v = (2/3) π μd^2 /ρ, where ρ is the density of the particle.

Substevens: The given information about the steel ball and the liquid Al is not directly related to the terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle in a quiescent liquid Al bath. The force exerted on the steel ball by the liquid Al is given by F = f π R^2 (ρv^2 /2), where f is the friction factor, R is the radius of the steel ball, and ρ and v are the density and velocity of the liquid Al, respectively. This equation is used to calculate the force exerted on the steel ball in an upward moving liquid Al, not the terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle in a quiescent liquid Al bath.

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be determined directly from the given information.

However, we can estimate the terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle in a quiescent liquid Al bath using the given information about the liquid Al viscosity and the steel ball density. We can assume that the particle size is within the µm range, so the Reynolds number is much less than 1, indicating laminar flow. Under these conditions, Stokes' law applies, and the terminal velocity can be calculated as v = (2/3) π μd^2 /ρ, where μ = 1*$10^(–3)$ Pa.s and ρ = 7200 kg/$m^(3)$.

Using this information, we can calculate the terminal velocity as:

v = (2/3) π (1*$10^(–3)$ Pa.s) (d^2) /(7200 kg/$m^(3)$)

To find the value of v, we need to know the diameter of the particle (d). Without this information, we cannot determine the terminal velocity.

Therefore, the answer is (D) insufficient information.

However, based on the given information, we can estimate the order of magnitude of the terminal velocity. For example, if we assume a typical diameter of 10 µm for the steel particle, we can calculate:

v = (2/3) π (1*$10^(–3)$ Pa.s) (10^-6 m)^2 /(7200 kg/$m^(3)$)

At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is","To calculate the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle, we can use the equation for the mass flow rate of a steady, incompressible fluid through a circular nozzle:

˙m = ρAv

where ρ is the density of the fluid, A is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle, and v is the velocity of the fluid at the nozzle exit.

First, we need to find the velocity of the fluid at the nozzle exit. We can use Bernoulli's equation to relate the pressure and velocity at the nozzle exit to the pressure and height of the liquid column:

P1 + ρgh1 = P2 + 1/2ρv22

where P1 is the pressure at the surface of the liquid column (assumed to be atmospheric), h1 is the height of the liquid column, and P2 is the pressure at the nozzle exit.

Since the nozzle discharge coefficient is given as 0.80, we can use it to relate the actual velocity of the fluid at the nozzle exit to the theoretical velocity:

v = Cd * √(2gh)

where Cd is the discharge coefficient, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the liquid column.

Substituting the given values, we have:

P1 + 7000 kg/$m^3 * 9.81 m/$s^2 * 3.2 m = P2 + (0.80)2 * (2 * 9.81 m/$s^2 * 3.2 m)2

Solving for P2, we get:

P2 = 7000 kg/$m^3 * 9.81 m/$s^2 * 3.2 m * (1 - (0.80)2) = 11,526 Pa

Next, we can find the velocity of the fluid at the nozzle exit:

v = 0.80 * √(2 * 9.81 m/$s^2 * 3.2 m) = 11.52 m/$s

Now we can find the cross-sectional area of the nozzle:

A = π * (d/2)2 = π * (0.03 m)2 = 0.000314 m2

Finally, we can calculate the initial mass flow rate:

˙m = 7000 kg/$m^3 * 0.000314 m2 * 11.52 m/$s = 23.4 kg/$s

Therefore, the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle is 23.4 kg/$s.",,,0,

Explanation:

The given information states that the flow is horizontal, slow, steady, and fully developed far from the object. This implies that the flow is two-dimensional and irrotational in the absence of the sphere. When a solid object is introduced into a fluid flow, the fluid particles near the surface of the object experience a no-slip condition, meaning that they come to rest with the surface of the object. This results in a boundary layer forming around the object, causing the fluid to be deflected around it. Therefore, statement (D) is true.

The other statements are not necessarily true:

(A) The velocity of the fluid at the point A is not necessarily zero, as the flow is deflected around the object.

(B) The fluid pressure at the point A may or may not exceed that at point O, depending on the shape of the object and the flow around it. In general, the Bernoulli equation predicts that the pressure is lowest at points of maximum velocity and highest at points of minimum velocity. However, the presence of the boundary layer and the no-slip condition complicate the pressure distribution around the object.

(C) Fluid moving precisely along OA will not turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object, as the flow is assumed to be horizontal and steady. The flow is deflected around the object in the boundary layer, but it does not make a right angle turn.",,,0,

Ladle deoxidation of liquid steel is done at 1600°C by adding ferro-aluminium. By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?","To calculate the time required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m in a liquid steel bath at 1600°C, we can use Stokes' law.

First, we need to calculate the terminal velocity of the alumina particle using Stokes' law:

Terminal velocity (u) = 2 * g * (ρs - ρf) * r / (9 * μ)

where:
- g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.
- ρs is the density of the solid particle (alumina).
- ρf is the density of the fluid (steel).
- r is the radius of the particle.
- μ is the viscosity of the fluid.

Substituting the given values:

Terminal velocity (u) = 2 * 9.81 * (3650 - 7000) * (50 * 10^-6) / (9 * 6 * 10^-3)

Terminal velocity (u) = 1.38 * 10^-3 m/s

Next, we can calculate the settling velocity (vs) using Stokes' law:

Settling velocity (vs) = 1/2 * g * (ρs - ρf) * r^2 / μ

Settling velocity (vs) = 1/2 * 9.81 * (3650 - 7000) * (50 * 10^-6)^2 / (6 * 10^-3)

Settling velocity (vs) = 1.98 * 10^-4 m/s

Now, we can calculate the time required for the particle to travel a distance of 2m using the settling velocity:

Time (t) = (2m) / (vs)

Time (t) = (2m) / (1.98 * 10^-4 m/s)

Time (t) = 1.01 * 10^4 s

Therefore, it would take approximately 101,000 seconds (or about ≈ 28 hours) for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m in a liquid steel bath at 1600°C.",,,0,

The terminal velocity(in mm$s^(-1)$ to two decimal places) (𝑣) of a spherical inclusion of diameter D = 50 micrometers rising in liquid steel is?"," To find the terminal velocity of a spherical inclusion using Stokes law, we can use the following equation:

$𝑣 = \dfrac{2}{9} \dfrac{𝜇𝑑}{𝜇}$

where $𝜇$ is the viscosity of the liquid steel, $𝑑$ is the density difference between the inclusion and the liquid steel, and $𝑣$ is the terminal velocity.

Substituting the given values, we have:

$𝑣 = \dfrac{2}{9} \dfrac{0.0079 \text{ Pa s} \times 2500 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3} - 7900 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}}{0.0079 \text{ Pa s}}$

$𝑣 = \dfrac{2}{9} \dfrac{17100 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}}{0.0079 \text{ Pa s}}$

$𝑣 = \dfrac{2}{9} \times 22132.12 \text{ m}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$

$𝑣 = 8071.3 \text{ m}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$

To convert this to mm/s, we can use the conversion factor:

$1 \text{ m}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1} = 1000 \text{ mm}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$

$𝑣 = 8071.3 \times 1000 \text{ mm}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$

$𝑣 = 8,071,300 \text{ mm/s}$

Therefore, the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion is approximately 8,071,300 mm/s or 8.1 km/s. However, this value is not physically realistic, as it is much larger than the terminal velocity of a spherical inclusion in a real-world situation.

Explanation: The dye-penetrant test is used to detect surface-breaking defects in non-porous materials such as metals, ceramics, or plastics.

Statement (A) is incorrect because pre- and post-cleaning of parts are required to ensure that the surface is free of contaminants that may prevent the penetrant from entering the defects.

Statement (C) is incorrect because surface oxides do not help in crack identification during the dye-penetrant test. In fact, they may interfere with the test by absorbing the penetrant and making it difficult to detect the defects.

Statement (D) is incorrect because the type of dye used in the dye-penetrant test does not depend on the contact angle.

Given:
[Fe$^{3+}$] = $10^(-3)$ M
$K_{sp}$ (Fe(OH)$_3$) = $10^(-39)$

We assume activity equals concentration, so the activity of $Fe^{3+}$ is also $10^(-3$M$$. To find the pH, we need to find the hydroxide ion concentration, which can be calculated using the solubility product expression:

$K_{sp}$ (Fe(OH)$_3$) = [Fe$^{3+}$][OH$^-$]³

Substituting the given value of [Fe$^{3+}$], we get:

$10^(-39)$ = $10^(-3)$[OH$^-$]³

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log[$10^(-39)$] = log[$10^(-3)$] + 3log[OH$^-$]

Since log[$10^(-39)$] = -39 and log[$10^(-3)$] = -3, we have:

-39 = -3 + 3log[OH$^-$]

Solving for log[OH$^-$], we get:

log[OH$^-$] = -12.33

Taking the antilogarithm of both sides, we get:

[OH$^-$] = $10^{-12.33}$ = $4.51 \times 10^{-13}$ M

To find the pH, we use the definition of pH:

pH = -log[H$^+$]

Since [OH$^-$] = $4.51 \times 10^{-13}$ M, we have:

[H$^+$] = $[Fe^{3+}]$ = $10^{-3}$ M


pH = -log[$10^{-3}$] = 3

Time taken(in seconds) for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is?(round off to two decimal places). ","To find the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm, we can use the parabolic rate equation:

x^2 = kt

where x is the thickness of the oxide film, k is the parabolic rate constant, and t is the time.

We are given the density of the oxide as 6.5 g.cm^(-3), and we want to find the thickness of the oxide film, which is 2 µm or 2*10^-6 cm.

First, we need to find the weight of the oxide film:

weight = density * volume

Since the volume of the oxide film is given by its thickness multiplied by its area, we can write:

weight = 6.5 g.cm^(-3) * (2*10^-6 cm)^2 * A

where A is the area of the oxide film.

Now, we can find the thickness of the thickness of the oxide film in terms of weight:

x = sqrt(k * t * A / 6.5)

We want to find t, so we need to eliminate A from the equation. We can do this by using the fact that the weight of the oxide film is proportional to its volume, which is x^2 * A:

weight = 6.5 g.cm^(-3) * x^2 * A

weight = 6.5 g.cm^(-3) * (k * t * A / 6.5)

Solving for t:

t = (weight / (6.5 g.cm^(-3) * k))^2

Substituting the given values:

t = (2*10^-6 g / (6.5 g.cm^(-3) * 3*10^-6 g^2.cm^(-4).s^(-1)))^2

t = 1.15*10^10 s

Therefore, the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is 1.15*10^10 seconds or approximately 3.7*10^6 hours.
