Thermodynamics,2,G-XEC-2012-6,MCQS,49,"Of the following materials, which is the most suitable for an LED emitting at around 380 nm?  (A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap (B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap (C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap (D) Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap ","A. Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap.

Explanation:
LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) work by the recombination of electrons and holes in the semiconductor material, which results in the emission of photons. The energy of the photons corresponds to the energy difference between the conduction band and the valence band, which is the bandgap energy.

For an LED to emit at around 380 nm, the bandgap energy should be approximately equal to the energy of the photon, which is given by the equation:

Eg = hc / λ

where Eg is the bandgap energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Substituting the given wavelength of 380 nm, we get:

Eg = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) x (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (380 x 10^-9 m)
Eg = 2.72 eV

Now, let's compare the given options with this energy value:

A. Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap: This option is the most suitable one, as a small bandgap is required to match the given energy value.

B. Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap: Indirect bandgap materials require the momentum of the electron to be conserved during the recombination process, which makes it less efficient for emitting light at a specific wavelength. Moreover, a large bandgap is not suitable for the given energy value of energy value.

C. Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap: A large bandgap is not suitable for the given energy value, as it is larger than what is required.

D. Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap: Indirect bandgap materials, as mentioned earlier, are less efficient for emitting light at a specific wavelength due to the momentum conservation requirement. Moreover, a small bandgap is not suitable for the given energy value, as it is smaller than what is required.

Thermodynamics,4,G-XEC-2013-15,NUM,29,"The band gap of a semiconducting material used to make an LED is 1.43 eV. What will be the minimum wavelength ofthe radiation emitted by this LED, in μm?","To find the minimum wavelength of radiation emitted by an LED with a band gap of 1.43 eV, we can use the relationship between the band gap energy and the wavelength of radiation given by Planck's equation:

E = hc/λ

where E is the energy (band gap), h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Rearranging this equation to solve for λ, we get:

λ = hc/E

Substituting the values, we have:

λ = (6.626 × 10^-34 Js) × (3.00 × 10^8 m/s) / (1.43 eV × 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV)

Using the given value of the band gap energy in electron volts (eV), we need to convert it to Joules (J) for the calculation.

1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV

So, 1.43 eV = 1.43 × 1.602 × 10^-19 J

Now, we can calculate the minimum wavelength:

λ = (6.626 × 10^-34 Js) × (3.00 × 10^8 m/s) / (1.43 × 1.602 × 10^-19 J)

λ ≈ 871.8 nm

To convert nanometers (nm) to micrometers (μm), we need to divide the value by 1000:

λ ≈ 871.8 nm / 1000 ≈ 0.872 μm

Therefore, the minimum wavelength of radiation emitted by the LED is approximately 0.872 μm.

Explanation:
At low injection level, the forward biasing of a p-n junction results in the injection of minority carriers (electrons in p-type region and holes in n-type region) into the respective regions. The concentration of injected minority carriers is much higher than the concentration of majority carriers due to the large difference in doping concentrations.

If 100 g of water that is at 90 °C is added to the cup, the final temperature of water in °C is"," To find the final temperature of the water in the copper cup after adding 100 g of water at 90 °C, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The initial energy of the system is the sum of the energy in the 80 g of water at 4 °C and the copper cup. The final energy of the system is the sum of the energy in the 180 g of water (80 g + 100 g) and the copper cup at the final temperature.

First, let's calculate the initial energy of the system:

Initial energy = m\_water\_1 * c\_water\_1 * ΔT\_1 + m\_cup * c\_cup * ΔT\_1

where m\_water\_1 = 80 g, c\_water\_1 = 4.18 J/g °C, ΔT\_1 = 46 °C (90 °C - 4 °C), m\_cup = 140 g, and c\_cup = 0.385 J/g °C.

Initial energy = 80 g * 4.18 J/g °C * 46 °C + 140 g * 0.385 J/g °C * ΔT\_1
Initial energy = 33840 J + 52.12 * ΔT\_1

Next, let's calculate the final energy of the system:

Final energy = m\_water\_2 * c\_water\_2 * ΔT\_final + m\_cup * c\_cup * ΔT\_final

where m\_water\_2 = 180 g, c\_water\_2 = 4.18 J/g °C, and ΔT\_final is the final temperature of the water in the cup.

We can set the initial energy equal to the final energy and solve for ΔT\_final:

33840 J + 52.12 * ΔT\_1 = 180 g * 4.18 J/g °C * ΔT\_final + 140 g * 0.385 J/g °C * ΔT\_final

To simplify the equation, let's define some variables:

m\_total = m\_water\_1 + m\_water\_2 + m\_cup = 362 g
c\_total = (m\_water\_1 * c\_water\_1 + m\_cup * c\_cup) / m\_total

The equation becomes:

33840 J = (m\_total * c\_total * ΔT\_final) - (180 g * 4.18 J/g °C * ΔT\_final - 52.12 * ΔT\_1)

Solving for ΔT\_final:

ΔT\_final = [(33840 J + 52.12 * ΔT\_1) / (m\_total * c\_total)]

Substituting the given values:

ΔT\_final = [(33840 J + 52.12 * 46 °C) / (362 g * (4.18 J/g °C + 0.385 J/g °C))]

Calculating the value of ΔT\_final:

ΔT\_final ≈ 53.1 °C

So, the final temperature of the water in the copper cup after adding 100 g of water at 90 °C is approximately 53.1 °C.

Answer: The final temperature of the water in the copper cup is approximately 53.1 °C.",,,0,
Thermodynamics,8,G-XEC-2014-17,MCQS-NUM,44,"The energy in eV and the wavelength in μm, respectively, of the photon emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom falls from n = 4 to n = 2 state is  (A) 3.0, 0.413 (B) 2.55, 0.365 (C) 2.75, 0.451 (D) 2.55, 0.487"," The correct answer is (B) 2.55, 0.365.

Explanation:

The energy difference between the n = 4 and n = 2 states of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the Rydberg formula (4.43) given by:

ΔE = Rydberg constant × R(1/(n1^2 - 1/(n2^2))

where n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states, respectively.

The Rydberg constant is 1.097 × 10^7 eV·m.

Using the given values, we have:

ΔE = 1.097 × 10^7 eV·m × R(1/(4^2 - 1/(2^2))

ΔE = 2.55 eV

The wavelength of the emitted photon can be calculated using the relation:

λ = hc/ΔE

where h is Planck's constant (6.63 × 10^-34 J·s), c is the speed of light (3.0 × 10^8 m/s), and ΔE is the energy difference.

Using the given value of ΔE, we have:

λ = (6.63 × 10^-34 J·s × 3.0 × 10^8 m/s) / 2.55 eV

λ = 0.365 μm

Therefore, the energy of the photon is 2.55 eV and its wavelength is 0.365 μm.

Explanation: The glass transition temperature (Tg) is the temperature above which a supercooled liquid becomes an rigid solid with a high viscosity.

Thermodynamics,12,G-XEC-2015-48-5,MCQS,31,"The slope of a graph of $log_e$(conductivity) versus 1/T (where T is the temperature) for an intrinsic semiconductor with energy gap $E_g$, is  (A) $E_g$/2k (B) –$E_g$/2k (C) $E_g$/k (D) −$E_g$/k","The correct answer is (B) –$E_g$/2k.

Explanation:

The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor can be expressed as σ = nqμ, where n is the carrier density, q is the charge of an electron, and μ is the mobility. The carrier density n can be related to the Fermi level E_F and the energy gap E_g through the Fermi-Dirac distribution function.

At high temperatures, the Fermi distribution function can be approximated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function, and the carrier density can be expressed as n = Nc(exp(E_g/2kT) - 1)^(-1), where Nc is the density of states in the conduction band.

The logarithm of the conductivity can then be expressed as log_e(σ) = log_e(nqμ) = log_e(Nc) + log_e(q) + log_e(μ) + log_e(n).

The logarithm of the carrier density can be expressed as log_e(n) = log_e(Nc) + log_e(exp(E_g/2kT) - 1), where E = E_g/2.

Taking the derivative of log_e(σ) with respect to 1/T, we have:

d(log_e(σ))/d(1/T) = d(log_e(n))/d(1/T) + d(log_e(μ))/d(1/T)

Using the chain rule, we have:

d(log_e(n))/d(1/T) = d(log_e(Nc) + log_e(exp(E_g/2kT) - 1))/d(1/T)

= d(log_e(Nc))/d(1/T) + d(log_e(exp(E_g/2kT) - 1))/d(1/T)

Using the properties of logarithmic functions, we have:

d(log_e(Nc))/d(1/T) = 0 (since Nc is a constant)

d(log_e(exp(E_g/2kT) - 1))/d(1/T) = -E_g/2k (using the chain rule and the property of logarithmic derivatives)

Therefore, the slope of the graph of log_e(σ) versus 1/T is –$E_g$/2k.",,,0,

Thermodynamics,14,G-XEC-2015-65-22,NUM,32,What would be the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV. The band gap of silicon is 1.1 eV.,"To find the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV, we need to calculate the number of pairs produced per photon and then multiply it by the total number of photons.

First, let's find the number of pairs produced per photon:

Energy of one pair = 1.1 eV
Energy of one photon = 1.54 keV = 1.54 x 10^3 eV

Number of pairs produced per photon = Energy of one photon / Energy of one pair
Number of pairs produced per photon = 1.54 x 10^3 eV / 1.1 eV
Number of pairs produced per photon = 1.398 x 10^3 pairs

Now, let's assume that the detector receives a certain amount of radiation, and we'll calculate the maximum number of pairs that can be generated with that amount of radiation. Let's say the detector receives 1 Joule of energy from the x-rays.

Total energy of all the photons = 1 Joule
Total number of photons = Total energy of all the photons / Energy of one photon
Total number of photons = 1 Joule / (1.54 x 10^3 eV)
Total number of photons = 6.48 x 10^12 photons

Maximum number of electron-hole pairs = Number of pairs produced per photon x Total number of photons
Maximum number of electron-hole pairs = 1.398 x 10^3 pairs x 6.48 x 10^12 photons
Maximum number of electron-hole pairs = 8.81 x 10^15 pairs

So, the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV is 8.81 x 10^15 pairs.",,,0,

Explanation: In a typical metal at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the Fermi energy is defined as the energy level for which the probability of occupancy is 0.5 according to the Fermi-Dirac distribution. This is because the Fermi level is the highest energy level that an electron can occupy at 0 K, and at room temperature, some electrons are thermally excited to higher levels.

A direct bandgap semiconductor has a bandgap of 1.8 eV. The threshold value of the wavelength(in Å) BELOW which this material will absorb radiation is","To find the threshold wavelength for absorption, we need to use the relationship between energy, frequency, and wavelength given by Planck's equation, E = hc/λ. We are given the energy gap, E = 1.8 eV, and we can convert eV to Joules (J) using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 * $10^(−19)$ J.

First, let's convert the energy gap to Joules:

1.8 eV * 1.602 * $10^(−19)$ J/eV = 2.885 * $10^(−19)$ J

Now, we can use the relationship E = hc/λ to find the threshold wavelength:

λ = hc/E = (6.626 * $10^(−34)$ J s * 3 * $10^8$ m/s) / (2.885 * $10^(−19)$ J)

Thermodynamics,19,G-XEC-2018-4,MCQS,56,An electron makes a transition from the valence band to the conduction band in an indirect band gap semiconductor. Which one of the following is true?  (A) Energy of the electron decreases. (B) A photon is emitted in the process. (C) A phonon is annihilated in the process. (D) A photon is created in the process.," C. A phonon is annihilated in the process is false.

Explanation:

In an indirect band gap semiconductor, the minima of the conduction band and maxima of the valence band occur at different values of wave vector. For the conservation of momentum, an electron must undergo a significant change in momentum for a photon of energy Eg to produce an electron-hole pair. This change in momentum is achieved by the interaction of the electron with a phonon, which transfers the excess momentum to the lattice. Therefore, the presence of phonons is essential for indirect transitions to occur. However, the annihilation of a phonon is not a process that occurs in the transition itself, but rather a necessary condition for the transition to take place.

Therefore, the answer is (C) is false. The correct answer is (B) A photon is absorbed in the process.",,,0,
Thermodynamics,20,G-XEC-2018-18,NUM,42,"When 3 identical non-interacting spin ½ particles are put in an infinite potential well, the ground state energy of the system is 18 meV. If instead, seven particles are put inside the potential well, the new ground state energy in meV is?","To find the ground state energy of seven identical non-interacting spin ½ particles in an infinite potential well, we can use the energy formula for a single particle in a potential well and then multiply it by the number of particles.

The energy of a single spin ½ particle in an infinite potential well is given by:

E = ℏ²π²(nₙ² + l(l+1)²) / 2m

where n is the principal quantum number, l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and m is the mass of a spin ½ particle. Since the particles are non-interacting and identical, they will occupy the same energy levels.

First, let's find the quantum numbers for the three particles in the ground state when the energy is 18 meV. We can use the following relationship between energy and quantum numbers:

E = ℏ²π²(nₙ² + l(l+1)²) / 2m
18 meV = ℏ²π²(nₙ² + l(l+1)²) / 2(9.109 × 10³¹ kg)

Solving this equation, we find that n = 1 and l = 0.

Now, to find the ground state energy for seven particles, we need to find the number of states occupied by these particles in the ground state. Since the particles are identical, they will fill the lowest energy levels up to the point where all levels are occupied.

The number of states in a given energy level is given by:

N = 2(2l+1)

where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Since we have found that l = 0 for the ground state of a single particle, the number of states in the ground state is:

N = 2(2×0+1) = 2

To find the number of states occupied by seven particles, we can use the following formula:

N = 2 × (number of energy levels × number of states per energy level)

Since the energy levels are degenerate, the number of energy levels occupied by seven particles is:

number of energy levels = ⌊7/2⌋ + 1 = 4

Therefore the number of states per energy level = 2

So, the number of states occupied by seven particles is:

N = 2 × (4 × 2) = 16

To find the ground state energy for seven particles, we can use the same energy formula as before, but with the number of particles and the total number of states occupied:

E = ℏ²π²(nₙ² + l(l+1)²) / 2m
E = ℏ²π²(1² + 0(0+1)²) / 2m × 16

Plugging in the values, we get:

E = ℏ²π²(1² + 0)² / 2m × 16 = ℏ²π² / 2m × 16 = 16 × (13.602 × 10⁻³² eV)² / (2 × 9.109 × 10³¹ kg) = 113.2 meV

Therefore, the ground state energy for seven identical non-interacting spin ½ particles in an infinite potential well is 113.2 meV.",,,0,

Mild steel is carburized at 1300 K for 1 hour to obtain a certain case depth. Keeping the time as 1 hour, the case depth can be doubled by increasing the temperature to what temperature(in K)? (round off to the nearest whole number)","To find the temperature at which the case depth can be doubled by carburizing mild steel for 1 hour while keeping the activation energy (Q) and gas constant (R) constant, we can use the Arrhenius equation:

dC/dt = k * C0 * e^(-Q/RT)

where:
dC/dt = reaction rate
C0 = initial concentration
k = pre-exponential factor
R = gas constant
T = temperature in Kelvin

Since we want to find the temperature at which the case depth is doubled, we can set up the equation as follows:

C(t2) = 2 * C(t1)

where C(t1) is the concentration at the initial temperature (1300 K), and C(t2) is the concentration at the final temperature.

We can rearrange the Arrhenius equation to solve for T:

ln(C(t2)/C(t1)) = ln(2) + ln(k) - Q/(2 * R * T)

Since we don't have the initial concentration (C0), we can't directly calculate the temperature using this equation. However, we can make an approximation based on the fact that the reaction rate is proportional to the concentration. Therefore, if we assume that the initial concentration is the same at both temperatures, we can simplify the equation as follows:

T = Q/(2 * R * ln(2)

Plugging in the given values:

T = 148000 J/mol / (2 * 8.314 J/mol K * ln2)

(round off to 2 decimal places)","To find the equilibrium distance between the atom pair, we need to find the value of r that minimizes the potential energy U(r). We can do this by setting the derivative of U(r) with respect to r equal to zero and solving for r.

First, we find the derivative of U(r):

dU/dr = d/dr (-A/r^3 + B/r^7)

Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:

dU/dr = (-3A/r^4 + 7B/r^8)

Setting dU/dr equal to zero and solving for r, we get:

The lowest value of $T_f$( in °C) at which material will fail is?(round off to the nearest integer.). Assume that there is no plastic deformation during thermal cycling. ","To find the lowest value of $T\_f$ at which the material will fail during thermal cycling, we can use the equation for thermal stress:

$\sigma = \alpha E \Delta T$

where $\sigma$ is the thermal stress, $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

Since the material remains dimensionally constrained during thermal cycling, the change in length is zero, so the change in temperature is equal to the difference between the highest temperature $T\_f$ and the lowest temperature 25°C:

$\Delta T = T\_f - 25^\circ C$

Substituting the given values, we have:

$\sigma = (7.5 \times 10^{-6}^\circ C^{-1})(200 \times 10^9 Pa)(T\_f - 25^\circ C)$

We know that the material can withstand a maximum compressive stress of 200 MPa, so we can set up the following inequality:

(round-off to one decimal place)."," To find the radius of the critical nucleus during homogeneous solidification of a liquid metal, we can use Equation 2-43 (r* = 2γEN Tm (AH. AT)^(1/2)) from the context. We are given that γsl = 0.18 J.m^-2 and ΔGv = 0.18*10^(9) J.m^-3. We need to find Tm and AT.

First, let's find Tm. Since ΔGv is the change in volume free energy upon transformation from liquid to solid, it is equal to the latent heat of solidification (L) divided by the specific volume of the solid (1/ρs), where ρs is the density of the solid. We are given that ΔGv = 0.18*10^(9) J.m^-3. Let's assume a density of 7.0 g.cm^-3 for the liquid metal, which is typical for many metals. The specific volume of the solid can be calculated as 1/ρs = 1/(7.0 g.cm^-3) = 0.00143 cm^3.g^-1. The latent heat of solidification is given by L = ΔHv = ΔGv * ρs = 0.18*10^(9) J.m^-3 * 7.0 g.cm^-3 = 1.296*10^(11) J.m^-3.

Now, we can find Tm by setting ΔG = 0 at the melting point, where ΔG = ΔHv - Ts*ΔS, and ΔS is the entropy of fusion. For simplicity, let's assume ΔS = ΔHv/Tm. We can then solve for Tm:

Tm = ΔHv / ΔS = 1.296*10^(11) J.m^-3 / (ΔHv / Tm) = 1.296*10^(11) J.m^-3 * (1/ΔHv) = 1.02*10^(8) K.

Next, we can find AT = Tm - Ts. We are not given the temperature Ts, but we know that it is below Tm. Let's assume Ts = 0.95*Tm for the sake of an example.

AT = Tm - Ts = 1.02*10^(8) K - 0.95*1.02*10^(8) K = 6.12*10^(7) K.

Now, we can find the radius of the critical nucleus using Equation 2-43:

r* = 2γEN Tm (AH. AT)^(1/2) = 0.18 J.m^-2 * (1.66*10^-12 J.m^-3 * 1.02*10^(8) K * (6.12*10^(7) K)^2)^(1/2) = 1.12 nm.

Explanation:
The growth of grains in thin films is influenced by various factors, including the deposition rate and substrate temperature. At low deposition rates, there is more time for atoms to diffuse and agglomerate, leading to larger grain sizes. However, high substrate temperatures can also promote grain growth by increasing the atomic mobility and diffusion rates.

Faster cooling rates and greater undercooling temperatures result in smaller critical nuclei sizes.

Based on the context provided, the metal is undergoing rapid cooling, and it can solidify at three different temperatures: 500 °C, 400 °C, and 300 °C. Since the cooling rate is the same for all solidification temperatures, the undercooling temperature is the only factor that differs.

The glassy state is characterized by a solid-like structure with a disordered arrangement of atoms or molecules. However, the entropy of a glass is higher than that of the corresponding liquid due to the presence of localized structural arrangements and the absence of long-range order.

The Schottky defect formation reaction can be represented as:

KCl(s) ⇌ KCl(s) + e^(aq) + h^+(aq)

The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:

Kc = [e^(aq)][h^+(aq)]/[KCl(s)]^2

We can rewrite this expression in terms of the number of defects per mole of KCl using Avogadro's number and the molar concentration of defects:

Kc = (Nv_e * Nv_h) / (N_A^2 * N_KCl)

where Nv_e and Nv_h are the number of electrons and holes per molecule of KCl, respectively, and N_A is Avogadro's number.

The number of electrons and holes per molecule of KCl is 2, so Nv_e = Nv_h = 2.

The activation energy for the formation of Schottky defect is given as 250 kJ $mol^(-1)$. We can use this to calculate the Arrhenius equation to find the equilibrium constant at 300 °C:

Kc = Kc0 * exp(-Ea/RT)

where Kc0 is the equilibrium constant at a reference temperature, Ea is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We don't have a value for Kc0, but we can calculate it using the given data and the ideal gas law.

First, we need to calculate the molar concentration of defects at equilibrium using the ideal gas law:

n_e = (kT/q) * ln(Kc)

where n_e is the number of electrons per unit volume, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the charge of an electron.

We can then use Avogadro's number to find the number of defects per mole of KCl:

N_defects = n_e * V / N_A

where V is the volume of the sample.

Putting it all together, we get:

N_defects = (kT/q) * ln(Kc) * V / N_A

Substituting the given values, we get:

N_defects = (8.314 J.K^(-1).mol^(-1) * 300 K / 1.602*10^(-19) C * ln(Kc)) * (1 mol / 6.023*10^(23) mol^(-1)) * V

To find the value of Kc, we need to use the given activation energy and the temperature in Kelvin:

Ea = 250,000 J/mol = 250,000 J $mol^(-1)$
T = 300 °C = 373.15 K

Using the Arrhenius equation, we get:

Kc = Kc0 * exp(-250,000 J $mol^(-1)$ / (8.314 J.K^(-1).mol^(-1) * 373.15 K))

Calculating the value of Kc, we get:

Kc = 1.12*10^(-12}

1. Calculate the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$:


$$n_i = 2\left(\frac{2\pi m k_B T}{h^2}\right)^{3/2} e^{-\frac{E_g}{k_B T}}$$

Substitute the given values:

$$n_i = 2\left(\frac{2\pi (9.1\times 10^{-31} kg) (1.38\times 10^{-23} J.K^{-1}) (300 K)}{(6.6\times 10^{-34} J.J^{-1}.s^2)^2}\right)^{3/2} e^{-\frac{1.1 eV}{(1.38\times 10^{-23} J.K^{-1}) (300 K)}}$$

Calculate the exponential term:

$$e^{-\frac{1.1 eV}{(1.38\times 10^{-23} J.K^{-1}) (300 K)}} = e^{-\frac{1.1\times 1.6\times 10^{-19} J}{1.38\times 10^{-23} J.K^{-1}\times 300 K}} \approx e^{-1.1\times 10^7}$$

Now calculate the intrinsic carrier concentration:

$$n_i = 2\left(\frac{2\pi (9.1\times 10^{-31} kg) (1.38\times 10^{-23} J.K^{-1}) (300 K)}{(6.6\times 10^{-34} J.J^{-1}.s^2)^2}\right)^{3/2} e^{-1.1\times 10^7} \approx 1.1\times 10^{10} m^{-3}$$

2. Calculate the doping concentration $N_d$:

$$N_d = 5\times 10^{28} m^{-3} \times 1\times 10^{-6} = 5\times 10^{22} m^{-3}$$

3. Find the Fermi energy shift with respect to the intrinsic Ferm Fermi level:

$$\Delta E_F = k_B T \ln\left(\frac{n_i + N_d}{n_i}\right)$$

Substitute the values:

$$\Delta E_F = (1.38\times 10^{-23} J.K^{-1}) (300 K) \ln\left(\frac{1.1\times 10^{10} m^{-3} + 5\times 10^{22} m^{-3}}{1.1\times 10^{10} m^{-3}}\right)$$

Calculate the ratio:

Now calculate the Fermi energy shift:

$$\Delta E_F = (1.38\times 10^{-23} J.K^{-1}) (300 K) \ln(5.45\times 10^2) \approx 0.068 eV$$

The ΔW/A (in mg.$cm^(-2)$) after 500 min at 600°C will be? (round-off to two decimal places). "," To find the weight gain per unit area after 500 minutes of oxidation, we can use the parabolic rate law equation:

ΔW/A = kt^n

where ΔW/A is the weight gain per unit area, k is the rate constant, t is the time, and n is the order of the reaction.

From the given information, we know that ΔW/A = 1.0 mg.A$cm^(-2)$ after 100 minutes, so we can use this information to find the rate constant k and the order of the reaction n.

First, we need to convert the given weight gain per unit area to SI units:

1.0 mg.A$cm^(-2)$ = 0.001 g.m$^-2$

Now, we can rearrange the parabolic rate law equation to solve for k:

k = (ΔW/A)/(t^n)

Substituting the given values:

k = (0.001 g.m$^-2$)/(100 min$^2$)$^{(1/2)}$

k = 1.118 x 10$^-5$ g.m$^-2$.min$^{(1-n)/2}$

Since n is the order of the reaction, we don't know it yet. However, we can find it by trying different values and seeing which one gives a reasonable value for k.

Let's try n = 0.5 (since parabolic rate laws often have a fractional order):

k = 1.118 x 10$^-5$ g.m$^-2$.min$^{(-0.5)}$

k = 1.648 x 10$^-3$ g.m$^-2$.min$^{0.5}$

This value of k is not reasonable, so let's try n = 1 (since it's a common order for oxidation reactions):

k = 1.118 x 10$^-5$ g.m$^-2$.min$^{(1-1)/2}$

k = 1.118 x 10$^-5$ g.m$^-2$.min$^{0.5}$

This value of k is more reasonable, so we'll assume that the reaction order is n = 0.5.

Now we can find the weight gain per unit area after 500 minutes:

ΔW/A = kt^n

ΔW/A = (1.118 x 10$^-5$ g.m$^-2$.min$^{0.5}$)(500 min)$^{(0.5)}$

ΔW/A = 0.0113 g.m$^-2$

To convert to mg.cm$^-2$:

ΔW/A = 0.0113 g.m$^-2$ x 1000 mg/g x 1 cm$^2$/m$^2$ x 100000 cm$^2$/m$^2$

ΔW/A = 1130 mg.cm$^-2$

The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is? (round off to 2 decimal places)"," To find the percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K, we first need to calculate the change in volume for each direction and then find the total change in volume.

First, let's calculate the change in volume for each direction:

Parallel to the graphite layers:
ΔV_parallel = ΔL * A
where ΔL is the change in length and A is the area.

Change in length:
ΔL_parallel = α_parallel * ΔT * L_0
where α_parallel is the linear thermal expansion coefficient, ΔT is the change in temperature, and L_0 is the initial length.

ΔT = 1100 K - 900 K = 200 K
L_0 = constant

Substituting the values:
ΔL_parallel = 0.8 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * L_0

Perpendicular to the graphite layers:
ΔV_perpendicular = ΔV * ΔL
where ΔV is the initial volume.

Change in volume:
ΔV_perpendicular = α_perpendicular * ΔT * V_0
where α_perpendicular is the linear thermal expansion coefficient, ΔT is the change in temperature, and V_0 is the initial volume.

Substituting the values:
ΔV_perpendicular = 29 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * V_0

Total change in volume:
ΔV_total = ΔV_parallel + ΔV_perpendicular

Substituting the values:
ΔV_total = (0.8 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * L_0) + (29 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * V_0)

To find the percentage increase in volume, we need to calculate the ratio of the change in volume to the initial volume:

Percentage increase in volume = (ΔV_total / V_0) * 100%

Substituting the expression for ΔV_total:
Percentage increase in volume = [((0.8 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * L_0) + (29 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * V_0) / V_0] * 100%

Simplifying the expression:
Percentage increase in volume = [(0.8 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * L_0 / V_0 + 29 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * V_0 / V_0] * 100%

Percentage increase in volume = [(0.8 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K * L_0 + 29 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ * 200 K] * 100% / V_0

Answer: The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is [(1.616 * $10^(−2) + 5.8 * $10^(−2)] * 100% / V_0, where V_0 is the initial volume of graphite.",,,0,

First, let's find the density of states at the band edge for electrons (Nc) using the given mobility and density of states relation:

Nc = (2 * (2πm)^3 * μe^3) / (h^3)

where me is the effective mass of electrons, h is Planck's constant, and μe is the mobility of electrons.

Next, we can find the effective mass of electrons using the relation between mobility and effective mass:

μe = (e * √(2πm * kB * T)) / (m*)

where e is the absolute charge of an electron, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and m* is the effective mass of electrons.

Now, we can find the number of electrons excited using the given relation:

n_e = NA * exp(-Eg/kBT)

where NA is Avogadro's number, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Eg is the band gap.

Finally, we can find the band gap by solving for Eg in the equation for the number of electrons excited:

Eg = -kBT * ln(ne/NA)

Using the given values, we can calculate the effective mass of electrons, density of states at the band edge, and the band gap.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Find the effective mass of electrons:

μe = 0.14 m^2/(V s)

e = 1.60 * 10^-19 C

T = 298 K + 273.15 K = 571.15 K

kB = 8.62 * 10^-5 eV/K

μe = (e * √(2πm * kB * T)) / m*

m* = (e * √(2πm * kB * T))^2 / (0.14 * 1.60 * 10^-19)

m* = 9.11 * 10^-31 kg

2. Find the density of states at the band edge for electrons:

Nc = (2 * (2πm)^3 * μe^3) / (h^3)

Nc = (2 * (2π * 9.11 * 10^-31 kg)^3 * (0.14 * 1.60 * 10^-19)^3) / (6.626 * 10^-34 * 6.283 * 10^-15)^3

Nc = 2.44 * 10^19 states/Joule

3. Find the number of electrons excited:

n_e = NA * exp(-Eg/kBT)

n_e = 6.02 * 10^23 * exp(-Eg/(8.62 * 10.0005 * 571.15))

n_e = 1.13 * 10^11

4. Find the band gap:

Eg = -kBT * ln(ne/NA)

Eg = -(8.62 * 10^-5 * 571.15) * ln(1.13 * 10^11 / 6.02 * 10^23)

Eg = 1.12 eV

The refractive index of the glass material is 1.5 and the absorption coefficient can be changed from 0.3 $cm^(-1)$ to 1 $cm^(-1)$. In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places) ","To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of light coming out of the other side of the glass panel, we need to use the reflection coefficient at the interface between the air and the glass material. The reflection coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which depend on the refractive index and the absorption coefficient of the glass material.

When the absorption coefficient is 0.3 $cm^(-1)$, the reflection coefficient for normal incidence can be approximated using the following formula:

R = (n - 1)^2 / (n + 1)^2

where n is the refractive index of the glass material. Substituting n = 1.5, we get:

R = (1.5 - 1) ^ 2 / (1.5 + 1) ^ 2 = 0.113

This means that 11.3% of the incident light is reflected when the absorption coefficient is 0.3 $cm^(-1)$.

When the absorption coefficient is 1 $cm^(-1)$, the glass material becomes opaque, and almost all the incident light is reflected. Therefore, the minimum fraction of light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is close to 0.

To find the maximum fraction of light coming out of the other side of the glass panel, we can calculate the transmission coefficient using the following formula:

T = 1 - R

Substituting R = 0.113, we get:

T = 1 - 0.113 = 0.887

This means that 88.7% of the incident light is transmitted when the absorption coefficient is 0.3 $cm^(-1)$.

When the absorption coefficient is 1 $cm^(-1)$, the transmission coefficient is close to 0, and the maximum fraction of light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is close to 0.

Therefore, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is:

(Maximum / Minimum) = (0.887 / 0) = inf

However, this result is not physically meaningful, as the minimum fraction of light coming out of the other side of the glass panel cannot be 0 in practice. Therefore, we can conclude that the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is greater than any finite value when the absorption coefficient is changed from 0.3 $cm^(-1)$ to 1 $cm^(-1)$.

At equilibrium in a crystalline solid, the net inter-atomic force (F) between atoms is zero because the atoms are not experiencing any net force that would cause them to move. This is due to the balance of forces acting on each atom from its neighboring atoms.

The potential energy (U) is minimum at equilibrium because the atoms are in their most stable configuration, meaning that the total energy of the system is at a minimum. This is because the atoms are arranged in a way that minimizes the energy required to keep them in place.

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

where k is the reaction rate, A is the frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

We want to find T when k = 3k0, where k0 is the initial reaction rate.

First, we need to find the initial reaction rate at 300 K:

k0 = Ae^(-Ea/R(300))

Now, we want to find the temperature T when k = 3k0. We can set up the equation:

3k0 = Ae^(-Ea/R(T))

To solve for T, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(3) + ln(k0) = ln(A) - Ea/R(T)

We can approximate ln(3) as 1.0907 and ln(A) as a constant since we're only concerned with the temperature dependence.

1.0 + ln(k0) = -Ea/(R * T)

Now, we can solve for T:

T = -Ea/(R * ln(3) * ln(k0))

Substituting the given values:

T = -(8.314 * 10^3) / (8.314 * 1.381 * 10^-23 * ln(3) * ln(k0))

Since we don't have the value of k0, we cannot directly calculate the temperature. However, we can use trial and error to find an approximate answer.

Let's assume k0 = 1 M/s.

T = -(8.314 * 10^3) / (8.314 * 1.381 * 10^-23 * 1.0 * ln(1))
T = 5045.2 K

This temperature is much higher than the given temperature of 300 K. Let's try a lower value for k0.

T = -(8.314 * 10^3) / (8.314 * 1.381 * 10^-23 * 1.0 * ln(10^-6))
T = 447.5 K

This temperature is closer to the answer, but it's still not exactly what we're looking for. Let'Let's try a few more values of k0 and see if we can find a temperature that triples the initial reaction rate.

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

Since ΔH° and ΔS° are constant for a given reaction at constant temperature, we can rearrange the equation to find the ratio of the partial pressures:

ln(K) = ΔG°/RT

where K is the equilibrium constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

First, we need to find the value of K for the given reaction at 1173 K. We are given ΔG° = 8120 J.

ΔG° = -RTln(K)

Solving for K:

K = e^(-ΔG°/RT)

Substituting the values:

K = e^(-8120 J/(8.314 J/mol·K·mol)(1173 K))

K = 0.00012

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant expression to find the ratio of partial pressures:

Since Fe, FeO, and CO are in their standard states (1 mol/L), we can simplify the expression:

K = pCO/pCO2

Solving for pCO/pCO2:

pCO/pCO2 = K

Substituting the value of K:

where χ_(Cu) and χ_(Zn) are the interaction parameters for copper and zinc, respectively.

In a regular solution model, the interaction parameters are given by:

χ_i = x_i * (1 + ω_i * x_j)

where x_i and x_j are the mole fractions of components i and j, and ω_i and ω_j are the interaction energies between i and j.

Since we are given that the solution behaves as a regular solution, we can assume that the interaction energies are equal and constant, i.e., ω_Cu = ω_Zn = ω.

Therefore, we can write:

χ_Cu = x_Cu * (1 + ω * x_Zn)
χ_Zn = x_Zn * (1 + ω * x_Cu)

Substituting these expressions into the equation for ΔH^(mix), we get:

ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * x_Cu * x_Zn * (1 + ω * x_Cu) * (1 + ω * x_Zn)

To simplify this expression, we can assume that the interaction energy is small compared to unity, i.e., ω << 1. In this case, we can expand the terms using the binomial theorem:

(1 + ω * x_Cu) * (1 + ω * x_Zn) = 1 + ω * x_Cu + ω * x_Zn + ω^2 * (x_Cu^2 + x_Zn^2)

Substituting this expression back into the equation for ΔH^(mix), we get:

ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * x_Cu * x_Zn * (1 + ω * x_Cu + ω * x_Zn + ω^2 * (x_Cu^2 + x_Zn^2))

To find the value of ω, we need to know the composition of the solution. Let's assume that the mole fraction of copper is x_Cu = 0.4 and the mole fraction of zinc is x_Zn = 0.6.

Substituting these values into the equation for ΔH^(mix), we get:

ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * 0.4 * 0.6 * (1 + ω * 0.4 + ω * 0.6 + ω^2 * (0.4^2 + 0.6^2))

To find the value of ω that makes the integral enthalpy of mixing equal to the given value, we can set ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn) and solve for ω.

Setting the right-hand side equal to the left-hand side, we get:

-19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn) = -19250 * 0.4 * 0.6 * (1 + ω * 0.4 + ω * 0.6 + ω^2 * (0.4^2 + 0.6^2))

Dividing both sides by (-19250 * 0.4 * 0.6), we get:

χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn) = 1 + ω * 0.4 + ω * 0.6 + ω^2 * (0.4^2 + 0.6^2)

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn) - 1 = ω * 0.4 + ω * 0.6 + ω^2 * (0.4^2 + 0.6^2)

Solving for ω, we get:

ω = [(χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn) - 1) - 0.4 * (χ",,,0,

What is the activity of Q in an alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6 at the same temperature?,"To find the activity of Q in an alloy of composition xR = 0.6, we first need to calculate the activity coefficient using the given equation:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(𝑥_R)^2$ - 0.2*$(𝑥_R)^3$

Substitute xR = 0.6 into the equation:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(0.6)^2$ - 0.2*$(0.6)^3$
ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(0.36)$ - $0.2*(0.216)$
ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.2152$ - $0.0432$
ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.172$

Now, we can find the activity using the relationship:

$𝛾_𝑄$ = $e^{ln $𝛾_𝑄$}$
$𝛾_𝑄$ = $e^{0.172}$
$𝛾_𝑄$ ≈ 1.195

Since the activity coefficient is relative to the pure component Q, we need to multiply it by the mole fraction of Q in the alloy to get the activity:

$𝜏_𝑄$ = $𝛾_𝑄$ * $𝑥_𝑄$
$𝜏_𝑄$ = 1.195 * 0.4
$𝜏_𝑄$ ≈ 0.478

So, the activity of Q in an alloy of composition xR = 0.6 is approximately 0.478.

Assume that air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen.,"To find the theoretical requirement of air for the complete combustion of 100 m³ (at STP) of CH₄, we first need to determine the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. The combustion reaction of CH₄ with oxygen is:

CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O

From this reaction, we can see that for every mole of CH₄, we need 2 moles of O₂. Since air is 21% oxygen by volume, we can calculate the volume of air required for complete combustion of 100 m³ of CH₄.

First, let's find the number of moles of CH₄ in 100 m³:

Molar mass of CH₄ = 14.01 g/mol + 4 * 1.01 g/mol = 16.04 g/mol

100 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ * 16.04 g/kg / 16.04 g/mol = 1000 mol CH₄

Now, we need to find the number of moles of O₂ required:

1000 mol CH₄ * 2 mol O₂/mol CH₄ = 2000 mol O₂

Since air is 21% oxygen by volume, the volume of air required is:

2000 mol O₂ * (1 mol air / 0.21 mol O₂) = 9524.1 m³ air

So, the theoretical requirement of air (in m³ at STP) for the complete combustion of 100 m³ (at STP) of a fuel consisting of pure CH₄ is approximately 9524.1 m³.",,,0,

The slope of this line is positive because  (A) ∆S° is positive (B) ∆S° is negative (C) ∆H° is positive (D) ∆H° is negative","The slope of an Ellingham diagram line for the oxidation reaction of a metal is determined by the enthalpy change (∆H°) and entropy change (∆S°) of the reaction. According to the context provided, the given reaction is an oxidation reaction, which means that means that means that the number of moles of reactants is greater than the number of moles of products. This implies that ∆S° is negative for this reaction. However, the context also states that the slope of the Ellingham diagram line is positive.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) ∆H° is positive.

This may seem contradictory to the fact that ∆S° is negative, but it's important to remember that the Gibbs free energy change (∆𝐺) is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that can be done by a system at constant temperature and pressure. It is given by the equation ∆𝐺 = ∆𝐺° - TΔS, where ∆𝐺° is the standard Gibbs free energy change and TΔS is the change in entropy.

Since the reaction is exothermic (∆H° is negative), the standard Gibbs free energy change (∆𝐺°) is also negative. However, the entropy change (TΔS) is negative as well, and since T is positive, the product TΔS is also negative. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy change (∆𝐺) is given by ∆𝐺 = ∆𝐺° - TΔS = ∆𝐺° + |TΔS|. Since both ∆𝐺° and |TΔS| are negative, their sum will be positive, resulting in a positive slope for the Ellingham diagram line.",,,0,

Explanation:

At equilibrium, the number of degrees of freedom for the system is equal to the number of components. In this case, we have three components: Zn, CO, and CO2. Since Zn is in the gas phase, we have 3 degrees of freedom for Zn. For the gas phase species (CO and CO2), we have 3 degrees of freedom each. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom is 3 + 3 = 6.

Using the given reactions, we can write the following mole balance equations at equilibrium:

1. ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g)
   Balancing the number of moles of each component, we have:
   n(ZnO) = n(Zn) + n(CO)

2. 2CO(g) = CO2(g) + C(s)
   Balancing the number of moles of each component, we have:
   2*n(CO) = n(CO2) + n(C)

From the first equation, we can express the pressure of Zn in terms of the pressures of CO and CO2:

$p_{Zn}$ = $p_{Zn,g}$ = $p_{Zn,ideal}$ = $x_{Zn,g}$*$p_{total}$

where $x_{Zn,g}$ is the mole fraction of Zn in the gas phase and $p_{total}$ is the total pressure.

From the second equation, we can express the pressure of CO2 in terms of the pressures of CO and C:

$p_{CO_2}$ = $p_{CO_2,g}$ = $p_{CO_2,ideal}$ = $x_{CO_2,g}$*$p_{total}$

Since C is in the solid phase, its pressure is not specified. However, we can relate the pressures of CO and CO2 using the given reaction:

2*$p_{CO}$ = $p_{CO_2}$

Solving for $p_{CO_2}$, we get:

$p_{CO_2}$ = 2*$p_{CO}$

Substituting this expression into the equation for $p_{Zn}$, we get:

$p_{Zn}$ = $p_{Zn,g}$ = $x_{Zn,g}$*$p_{total}$ = $x_{Zn,g}$*$p_{total}$ = $x_{Zn,g}$*($p_{CO}$ + $p_{CO_2}$) = $x_{Zn,g}$*($p_{CO}$ + 2*$p_{CO}$)

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $p_{Zn}$ = 2*$p_{CO}$ + $p_{CO_2}$.",,,0,

Given:
γ_(SiC-SiC) = 0.80 J.m^(-2)
γ_(SiC-Ni) = 0.45 J.m^(-2)
SiC grain size (r\_g) = 20 µm

r = (0.80 J.m^(-2) × (20 × 10^(-6) m)^2) / (0.45 J.m^(-2) × 2)

r = (0.80 J.m^(-2) × 4 × 10^(-10) m^2) / (0.45 J.m^(-2) × 2)

r = 3.03 × 10^(-8) m

The adiabatic flame temperature(in K) for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is?(answer up to two decimal places)"," To find the adiabatic flame temperature for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen, we need to use the given data and the stoichiometric equation for the reaction.

Stoichiometric equation: CO(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)

Molar ratio of CO to O₂: 1 : 1

First, let's calculate the molar flow rate of oxygen required for stoichiometric combustion:

Molar flow rate of CO = 1 kg-mol.h⁻¹
Molar ratio of CO to O₂ = 1 : 1

Molar flow rate of O₂ = Molar flow rate of CO × Molar ratio of O₂
Molar flow rate of O₂ = 1 kg-mol.h⁻¹ × 1
Molar flow rate of O₂ = 1 kg-mol.h⁻¹

Now, we can calculate the heat released during the combustion process using the given enthalpy change:

ΔH°ₕ₂₉⁸ = -282000 kJ.(kg-mol CO)⁻¹

Since there is 1 kg-mol of CO entering the reactor, the heat released during the combustion process is:

Q = ΔH°ₕ₂₉⁸ × Molar flow rate of CO
Q = -282000 kJ.(kg-mol CO)⁻¹ × 1 kg-mol.h⁻¹
Q = -282000 J.h⁻¹

Now, we can use the energy balance equation for an adiabatic process to find the temperature increase:

ΔH = Q
ΔU = ΔH
Cp × ΔT = ΔH

where ΔU is the change in internal energy, Cp is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature increase.

We know that the combustion process is adiabatic, so there is no heat loss or gain. Therefore, ΔU = ΔH.

We also know that the specific heat capacity of CO₂ is given as 44 kJ.(kg-mol K)⁻¹.

Now, we can calculate the temperature increase:

Cp × ΔT = ΔH
44 kJ.(kg-mol K)⁻¹ × ΔT = -282000 J.h⁻¹

To solve for ΔT, we need to divide both sides by the specific heat capacity:

ΔT = (-282000 J.h⁻¹) / (44 kJ.(kg-mol K)⁻¹)
ΔT ≈ -6,404.55 K

Since the temperature cannot be negative, we have made an error in our calculation. The temperature increase should be positive. Let's check our calculation:

We have assumed that the heat released during the combustion process is entirely used to increase the temperature of the products. However, some of the heat is also used to overcome the bond energies of the reactants and form the products. This heat is not included in the given enthalpy change.

To correct for this, we need to use the enthalpy change of formation of CO₂ instead of the enthalpy change of combustion. The enthalpy change of formation of CO₂ at 298 K is given as -393,520 kJ.(kg-mol CO₂)⁻¹.

The stoichiometric equation for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is:

CO(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)

Molar ratio of CO to CO₂ = 1 : 1

Molar flow rate of CO₂ = Molar flow rate of CO × Molar ratio of CO₂
Molar flow rate of CO₂ = 1 kg-mol.h⁻¹ × 1

Cold working of iron leads to increase in dislocation density from $10^(10)$ to $10^(15)𝑚^(−2)$ . The associated stored energy (in 𝑴𝑱. $𝒎^(−𝟑)$, rounded off to one decimal place) is","To calculate the increase in strength due to cold working in iron, we need to use the Orowan equation, which relates the increase in yield stress to the dislocation density and the shear modulus:

Δσ = Kd(ρ1 - ρ0)

where Δσ is the increase in yield stress, K is the Orowan constant (approximately 0.1 for metals), ρ0 is the initial dislocation density, and ρ1 is the final dislocation density.

First, we need to find the initial and final shear moduli, taking into account the increase in dislocation density. The relationship between the shear modulus and dislocation density is given by:

G = G0(1 + αΔG/G0)

where G0 is the initial shear modulus, α is a constant (approximately 0.2 for metals), and ΔG is the change in shear modulus due to the dislocation density.

The change in shear modulus can be approximated using the Halpin-Tsai equation:

ΔG = ΔG0(1 + η(ρ1/ρ0)1/2)

where ΔG0 is the change in shear modulus due to a single dislocation, and η is a constant that depends on the geometry of the dislocation and the crystal lattice. For a face-centered cubic lattice, η is approximately 1.5.

Now we can calculate the increase in yield stress:

Δσ = Kd(ρ1 - ρ0)

where d is the thickness of the sheet before and after rolling. Since the thickness has been reduced by a factor of 2, we have:

b = a/2[1 1 1] = 0.1428 × 10^(-9) m

G0 = 82 × 10^9 Pa
b = 0.1428 × 10^(-9) m
a = 0.2856 × 10^(-9) m

Using the formula for the shear modulus in a face-centered cubic lattice:

G = (1/2)ρ0Shear(b^2)

where ρ0 is the density of the material and Shear is the shear elastic constant:

ρ0 = 7.87 g/cm^3 = 7.87 × 10^3 kg/m^3
Shear = 44 GPa = 44 × 10^9 Pa

G0 = (1/2)(7.87 × 10^3 kg/m^3)(44 × 10^9 Pa)(0.1428 × 10^(-9) m)^2

(C) 4 hours. (D) 16 hours. ","The time required for the center of a sphere to reach a certain temperature depends on its thermal diffusivity and the temperature difference between the sphere and the furnace. Since the spheres have different thermal diffusivities, the time required for sphere Y to reach 800K will be different from sphere X.

We can use the 1-D diffusion equation to estimate the time required for the center of the sphere to reach a certain temperature:

ρC(dT/dt) = k(d²T/dx²)

where ρ is the density, C is the specific heat capacity, k is the thermal conductivity, and x is the spatial coordinate.

Assuming that the spheres are uniformly heated from all sides, we can simplify the equation to:

t = (ρCd²)/(6k) (ΔT)²

where t is the time, d is the diameter, ΔT is the temperature difference between the sphere and the furnace.

Let's calculate the time required for sphere Y to reach 800K:

tY = (ρCYd²)/(6kY) (ΔT)²

Given:
ρX = ρY, CX = CY, dX = dY, ΔTX = ΔTY = ΔT, kX = 100*$10^(-6)m^(2)s^(-1), kY = 25*$10^(-6)m^(2)s^(-1)

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

tX = (ρCd²)/(6kX) (ΔT)² = (1 hour)²
tY = (ρCd²)/(6kY) (ΔT)²

To find tY, we need to calculate the value of (ΔT)²:

ΔT = Tf - Tc
Tf = 1000K, TcX = 800K

ΔT = 1000K - 800K = 200K

Now, we can calculate tY:

tY = (ρCd²)/(6kY) (ΔT)² = (ρCd²)/(6 * 25*$10^(-6)m^(2)s^(-1)) (200K)²

tY = (ρCd²)/(6 * 25*$10^(-6)m^(2)s^(-1)) (200K)² = (1 hour)² * (25/100)²

tY = 0.25 hours

The given alloy contains 50 wt.% Sn. To find the approximate amount of eutectic constituent (Mg-rich phase) present in the alloy, we can use the lever rule.

Let x be the weight fraction of the Mg-rich phase in the eutectic alloy. Then, the weight fraction of the Sn-rich phase is (1 - x).

From the given phase diagram, we have:

Sn in Mg-rich phase = 36.9%
Sn in Sn-rich phase = almost 100%

Using the lever rule, we have:

(Weight percentage of Mg-rich phase in alloy) x = (Weight percentage of Mg-rich phase in eutectic) * (Weight percentage of Sn in Mg-rich phase) / (Weight percentage of Sn in Sn-rich phase)

In a dilute solution of B in A, Raoult's law states that the activity of component B, $a\_B$, is related to its mole fraction, $X\_B$, through the activity coefficient, $\gamma\_B$:

γ = 2σ(1 + cosθ)

where θ is the contact angle between the solid and the liquid.

Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to γ, we get:

dγ/γ = d(2σ(1 + cosθ))/2σ(1 + cosθ)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

dγ/γ = (dσ/σ + d(1 + cosθ)/(1 + cosθ))

Since we are given that γ increases by 20%, we have:

dγ/γ = 0.2

We want to find the percentage change in r*. From the Legendre relation, we have:

r* = 2σ/γ

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and differentiating, we get:

dr*/r* = -d(lnγ)/d(lnσ)

Using the chain rule, we have:

dr*/r* = -(dlnγ/dγ)/(dlnσ/σ)

Substituting the given values, we get:

dr*/r* = -(0.2)/(1/2)

Percentage increase in r* = -0.4 × 100% = -40%

However, since the radius cannot decrease, the answer is not physically meaningful. It is likely that there is an error in the problem statement, and the percentage increase in surface energy should have been given as a decrease instead. In that case, the answer would be:

However, since the reaction takes place in the gas phase, the translational degrees of freedom for each component are three (x, y, z) in each dimension. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom for the system is 3 components × 3 dimensions × 2 sides = 18 degrees of freedom.

So, the answer is (D) 18 degrees of freedom.",,,0,

The weight gain (mg $cm^2$) after a duration of 1600s is?(round off to nearest integer). ," To find the weight gain after 1600 seconds, we can use the given relationship between weight gain and time:

Weight gain ∝ √t

First, we need to find the weight gain per second (rate of weight gain) from the given data:

Weight gain = 2 mg/cm²
Time = 400 s

Weight gain per second = Weight gain / Time = 2 mg/cm² / 400 s = 5 × 10⁻⁵ mg/cm²/s

Weight gain = Weight gain per second × √t

Weight gain = 5 × 10⁻⁵ mg/cm²/s × √1600 s

Weight gain = 5 × 10⁻⁵ mg/cm²/s × 40 × √10 = 5 × 10⁻⁵ mg/cm²/s × 40 × 10 = 200 × 10⁻⁵ mg/cm²

What is the change in the enthalpy of pure iron (in J/mol) when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C?," To find the change in enthalpy of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C, we need to integrate the specific heat function with respect to temperature and apply the integral limit.

First, let's find the derivative of the specific heat function with respect to temperature:

$C_p'$ = 24.77 * $10^(-3)$

Now, we can find the change in enthalpy by integrating the specific heat function:

$\Delta H$ = $\int_{298.15}^{1003.15} C_p dT$

$\Delta H$ = $\int_{298.15}^{1003.15} (17.49 + 24.77 * 10^(-3) * T) dT$

$\Delta H$ = $\left[17.49 * T + \frac{24.77}{10^3} * \frac{T^2}{2}\right]_{298.15}^{1003.15}$

$\Delta H$ = $(17.49 * 1003.15 + \frac{24.77}{10^3} * \frac{1003.15^2}{2}) - (17.49 * 298.15 + \frac{24.77}{10^3} * \frac{298.15^2}{2})$

$\Delta H$ = $17,490.15 + 247.7 - 13,313.35$

∆G° = -n * R * T * ln(Kc)

where n is the number of moles of gas participating in the reaction. In this case, case n = 4 (2 moles CO2 and 2 moles CO).

First, let's calculate Kc:

∆G° = -4 * R * T * ln(Kc)
-8000 J/mol = -4 * 8.314 J/mol*K * 1200 K * ln(Kc)

ln(Kc) = (-8000 J/mol * 1/(4 * 8.314 J/mol*K * 1200 K))
ln(Kc) = -0.0113
Kc = e^(-0.0113) = 0.9887

Now, we can find the equilibrium ratio (pCO2/pCO)^3:

(pCO2/pCO)^3 = Kc
(pCO2/pCO)^3 = 0.9887

On the other hand, if the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, the free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for solidification is ?","To find the free energy change for solidification when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, we need to use the given information about the free energy change when the liquid is undercooled to 1256 K and the fact that the free energy change is a linear function of temperature for small undercoolings.

First, let's find the temperature difference between the melting point and the undercooled temperatures:

T_melt = 1356 K
T_1256 = 1256 K
T_1200 = 1200 K

ΔT = T_melt - T

For T = 1256 K, ΔT = 100 K
For T = 1200 K, ΔT = 156 K

Now, we can find the slope of the free energy change curve (dΔG/dT) by using the given information:

dΔG/dT = Δ(ΔG)/ΔT = -1000 J $mol^(-1)$ / 100 K = -10 J $K^(-1)$ $mol^(-1)$

Next, we can find the free energy change for solidification when the liquid is undercooled to 1200 K:

ΔT = 156 K
dΔG/dT = -10 J $K^(-1)$ $mol^(-1)$

ΔG = ΔG(T_melt) + ∫(dΔG/dT)dT

ΔG = ΔG(T_melt) - ΔT * dΔG/dT

ΔG = -1000 J $mol^(-1)$ - 156 K * (-10 J $K^(-1)$ $mol^(-1)$)

ΔG = -1000 J $mol^(-1)$ + 1560 J $mol^(-1)$

We'll denote the mass flow rate of solid as m\_solid and the mass flow rate of liquid as m\_liquid.

First, let's calculate the heat required to solidify the metal:

Heat_solidified = m\_solid * Latent_heat_of_fusion

Next, we'll calculate the heat removed by the mould:

Heat_removed = Total_heat_removal

Since both solid and liquid remain at the melting point, the heat required to solidify the metal is equal to the heat removed by the mould. Therefore, we have:

m\_solid * Latent_heat_of_fusion = 4.2 × 10^6 W

Now, we can find the mass flow rate of solid:

m\_solid = Heat_removed / Latent_heat_of_fusion
m\_solid = 4.2 × 10^6 W / (3 × 10^5 J/kg)
m\_solid ≈ 13.97 kg/s

The total mass flow rate is the sum of the mass flow rates of solid and liquid:

Total_mass_flow_rate = m\_solid + m\_liquid

We know that the mass flow rate of solid is 13.97 kg/s, and the mass flow rate of liquid is the difference between the total mass flow rate and the mass flow rate of solid:

m\_liquid = Total_mass_flow_rate - m\_solid
m\_liquid = 35 kg/s - 13.97 kg/s
m\_liquid ≈ 21.03 kg/s

The mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is the mass flow rate of solid divided by the total mass flow rate:

Mass_fraction_solid = m\_solid / Total_mass_flow_rate
Mass_fraction_solid = 13.97 kg/s / (13.97 kg/s + 21.03 kg/s)
Mass_fraction_solid ≈ 0.393

ΔG° = -RT ln Kc

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and Kc is the equilibrium constant concentration.

First, we need to calculate the equilibrium constant concentration (Kc) using the given activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution (γ∞) and the molality of Si1 wt.% (m):

m = 1 kg/kg = 1 mol/kg

At infinite dilution, the activity of Si is equal to its concentration, so the activity of Si1 wt.% is m. The activity of pure Si is 1, so we can calculate Kc using the given activity coefficient:

Kc = (aSi1 wt.%) / (aSi, pure) = (mγ∞) / 1

Substituting the given value of γ∞ = 10^-3:

Kc = (1 × 10^-3) / 1 = 1 × 10^-3

Now we can calculate ΔG° using the given temperature (T = 1873 K):

R = 8.314 J/mol·K

ΔG° = -RT ln Kc

ΔG° = -(8.314 J/mol·K) × (1873 K) × ln(1 × 10^-3)

ΔG° ≈ -111,500 J/mol

In this case, we have:

Henry's law: x = KH * P

where x is the mole fraction of the dissolved gas, KH is the Henry's law constant, and P is the partial pressure of the gas.

First, we need to find the Henry's law constant for nitrogen in steel at 1873 K. We don't have the value given in the context, so we'll assume it's a constant and look it up in a reference. Let's assume KH = 1.2 × 10^-3 (mol/m^3)*(bar)^(-1).

Now, we can calculate the initial and final equilibrium nitrogen concentrations:

Initial condition:
x_initial = 14 ppm = 14 × 10^-6
P_initial = 1 mbar = 1 × 10^-3 bar

Using Henry's law:
x_initial = KH * P_initial
14 × 10^-6 = 1.2 × 10^-3 * 1 × 10^-3
x_initial = 1.71 × 10^-5

Final condition:
P_final = 0.7 mbar = 0.7 × 10^-3 bar

Using Henry's law again:
x_final = KH * P_final
x_final = 1.2 × 10^-3 * 0.7 × 10^-3
x_final = 8.44 × 10^-6

So, the new equilibrium nitrogen content at a lower pressure is approximately 8.44 ppm.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1500/2000) = ln(exp(-0.3*$𝑥^2$))

Using the property of logarithms:

ln(1500/2000) = -0.3*$𝑥^2$

Now, we can solve for $𝑥$:

$$\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ$$

We are given $\Delta H^\circ$ = −61080 J and $\Delta S^\circ$ = −132.22 J $K^(-1)$ . We can calculate $T$ by setting $\Delta G^\circ$ = 0:

$$\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ = 0$$

$$T = \frac{\Delta H^\circ}{\Delta S^\circ} = \frac{-61080}{-132.22} \approx 463.5 \text{ K}$$

Now, let's calculate the equilibrium constant $K\_p$ at this temperature using the given data:

$$K\_p = \frac{[Ag\_2O]^2}{[Ag]^4[O\_2]}$$

We are given that the reactants and products are pure, so their activities are equal to 1. Therefore, we can use the equilibrium constant expression directly:

$$K\_p = \frac{[Ag\_2O]^2}{[Ag]^4[O\_2]} = \frac{1}{K\_c}$$

where $K\_c$ is the equilibrium constant in molar concentration units. We can calculate $K\_c$ using the given data:

$$\Delta G^\circ = -RT\ln K\_c$$

$$\ln K\_c = \frac{-\Delta G^\circ}{RT} = \frac{-(-61080)}{(8.314)(298)(4)} \approx 11.25$$

$$K\_p = \frac{1}{3.04 \times 10^{4.5}} \approx 3.25 \times 10^{-5}$$

Now, we want to find the temperature at which $K\_p$ = 1, which corresponds to the temperature at which $Ag\_2O$ starts to decompose in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure of 0.3 atm. We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the temperature:

"," The given information states that the system containing the two pieces of copper remains isolated during the process. This means that there is no heat transfer between the system and its surroundings. Therefore, the entropy change of the system is equal to the sum of the changes in entropy of each piece of copper.

The change in entropy of a substance can be calculated using the following equation:

ΔS = m × Cp × ΔT

where m is the mass of the substance, Cp is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Since we have the specific heat capacity (Cp) and the initial temperatures (T1 and T2) of each piece of copper, we can calculate the change in temperature (ΔT) for each piece using the following equation:

ΔT = Tf - Ti

where Tf is the final temperature (the temperature after thermal equilibrium is reached) and Ti is the initial temperature.

First, we need to find the final temperature (Tf) by using the fact that the system remains isolated:

m1 × Cp1 × ΔT1 = m2 × Cp2 × ΔT2

where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two pieces of copper, Cp1 and Cp2 are their specific heat capacities, and ΔT1 and ΔT2 are their temperature changes.

Since both masses and specific heat capacities are equal for each piece of copper, we have:

Tf = (T1 + T2) / 2

Now, we can calculate the temperature change for each piece of copper:

ΔT1 = Tf - Ti = (T1 + T2) / 2 - T1 = (T2 - T1) / 2

ΔT2 = Tf - Ti = (T1 + T2) / 2 - Ti = (T1 - T2) / 2

Now, we can calculate the entropy change for each piece of copper:

ΔS1 = m × Cp × ΔT1 = 1 mol × 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ × (T2 - T1) / 2

ΔS2 = m × Cp × ΔT2 = 1 mol × 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ × (T1 - T2) / 2

The total entropy change for the system is the sum of the entropy changes for each piece of copper:

ΔS = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = 1 mol × 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ × ((T1 - T2) / 2 + (T2 - T1) / 2)

Simplifying the expression:

ΔS = 1 mol × 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ × (T1 - T2) / 2

Since the temperatures are given in Kelvin, the entropy change will also be in Joules per Kelvin (J $K^(-1)$).

Therefore, the answer is:

[11.325, -11.325, 0]

The first value in the list represents the entropy change if the temperatures are given in Kelvin in the order of the higher temperature first, the second value represents the entropy change if the temperatures are given in the order of the lower temperature first, and the third value represents the entropy change when the temperatures are equal.

The entropy change is negative when the higher temperature body loses heat to the lower temperature body, and positive when the lower temperature body gains heat from the higher temperature body. In this case, since both pieces of copper are initially at different temperatures, the entropy change is negative. However, the actual value depends on the specific temperatures given.",,,0,

Now, we can calculate the pressure difference:

Δp = p\_outer - p\_inner
Δp = $1.5 \times 10^5$ Pa - $1.0 \times 10^5$ Pa

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing (d) using the given atomic diameter (a) of Chromium:

a = 2.494 Å

The relationship between the lattice parameter (a) and interplanar spacing (d) for a bcc structure is:

d = a / √3

Substituting the value of a:

d = 2.494 Å / √3 ≈ 1.987 Å

Now, we can find the angle of diffraction (θ) using Bragg's law:

nλ = 2dsinθ

Substituting the values:

1.54 Å = 2 * 1.987 Å * sin(θ)

Solving for sin(θ):

sin(θ) ≈ 0.311

Using inverse sine function:

θ ≈ 18.42°

Atomic structure,8,G-XEC-2014-21,NUM,35,The expected diffraction angle (in degrees) for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for face centered cubic Pt (lattice parameter = 0.392 nm) using monochromatic radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm is," To find the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for face centered cubic Pt, we can use Bragg's equation:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the radiation, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the diffraction angle.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing for the (113) planes in face centered cubic Pt. The formula for the lattice parameter of a face centered cubic lattice is:

a = √2d

where a is the lattice parameter and d is the edge length of the cube. For Pt, the lattice parameter is given as 0.392 nm.

We can find the edge length of the cube by using the relationship between the lattice parameter and edge length:

a = 2√2d

Solving for d:

d = a^2 / (2√2)
d = (0.392 nm)^2 / (2√2)
d = 0.225 nm

Now we can use Bragg's equation to find the diffraction angle:

nλ = 2dsinθ
0.1542 nm = 2 * 0.225 nm * sin(θ)

To find the angle, we can use the inverse sine function:

θ = sin^-1(nλ / 2d)
θ = sin^-1(0.1542 nm / (2 * 0.225 nm))
θ = 11.1 degrees

Therefore, the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for face centered cubic Pt using monochromatic radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm is approximately 11.1 degrees.

Explanation:
The planar density of the (100) plane in an fcc crystal is given by the number of atoms per unit area. Since the atoms form a square lattice on the (100) plane, the number of atoms per unit area is given by the reciprocal of the area per atom. The area per atom is given by the square of the atomic radius. Therefore, the planar density is 0.25 times the square of the atomic radius of the element.",,,0,
Atomic structure,11,G-XEC-2015-64-21,NUM,30,Calculate the density of copper in kg $m^(-3)$ given that copper has an fcc lattice with a lattice parameter of 0.365 nm. Copper has an atomic weight of 63.54 amu,"To calculate the density of copper, we first need to determine the number of atoms in a unit volume of the fcc lattice. The lattice parameter a is given as 0.365 nm, and since an fcc lattice contains four atoms, the number of atoms in a unit volume (N) can be calculated as:

N = (number of atoms in a unit cell) × (number of unit cells in a unit volume)

The number of atoms in a unit cell (Z) for an fcc lattice is 4, so:

N = 4 × (number of unit cells in a unit volume)

To find the number of unit cells in a unit volume, we can use the lattice parameter a and the edge length of a cube that contains the same number of unit cells (l):

l = a√(Z)
l = 0.365 nm√(4)
l = 0.401 nm

Now, we can calculate the number of unit cells in a unit volume:

N = 4 × (1/(l)^3)
N = 4×(1/(0.401 nm)³)
N = 4.11×10²⁸ m⁻³

Next, we can calculate the mass of copper in a unit volume (M) by multiplying the number of atoms in a unit volume (N) with the mass of a single copper atom (m):

M = N×m
M = 4.11×10²⁸ m⁻³×63.54 g/mol
M = 267.1×10³ kg/m³

Finally, we can calculate the density (ρ) by dividing the mass in a unit volume (M) by the volume of a unit cell (V):

V = a³
V = (0.365 nm)³
V = 0.411 nm³

ρ = M/V
ρ = 267.1×10³ kg/m³/(0.411 nm³)
ρ = 6480 kg/m³

So, the density of copper is approximately 6480 kg/m³ or 6.48 g/cm³.",,,0,

If the lattice parameter is 4.1 Å, the angular position θ of the first diffraction peak(in degrees) is","To find the angular position of the first diffraction peak for a material with a BCC structure using monochromatic X-rays of wavelength 1.54 Å and a lattice parameter of 4.1 Å, we can use Bragg's equation:

nλ = 2dₕlₖsinθ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength, dₕlₖ is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the diffraction angle.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing dₕlₖ. For a BCC structure, the interplanar spacing for the (110) plane is given by:

dₕlₖ = λ / (2sin(θ/2))

where θ is the Bragg angle for the (110) plane, which is 60 degrees for a BCC structure.

Using the given lattice parameter of 4.1 Å, we can find the length of the unit cell edge a:

a = 2dₕlₖ = 2 * 4.1 Å = 8.2 Å

Now, we can find the interplanar spacing for the (110) plane using the relationship between the lattice parameter and the unit cell edge:

dₕlₖ = a / √3

Substituting the value of a, we get:

dₕlₖ = 8.2 Å / √3 ≈ 5.14 Å

Now, we can use Bragg's equation to find the diffraction angle θ:

1.54 Å = 2 * 5.14 Å * sin(θ / 2)

Solving for sin(θ / 2), we get:

sin(θ / 2) ≈ 0.111

Using the inverse tangent function, we can find the diffraction angle θ:

θ ≈ 2 * arcsin(0.111) ≈ 11.3 degrees

Therefore, the angular position of the first diffraction peak is approximately θ ≈ 11.3 degrees.

Explanation:

(i) Polymers that are less coiled have more regular chain conformations, which can facilitate crystallization. Therefore, they are more likely to be crystalline than those that are more coiled more coiled.

(ii) Branched polymers have irregular chain structures, which can hinder the packing of chains and make it more difficult for them to crystallize. Therefore, they are less crystalline than linear polymers.

(iii) Inter-chain interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions, can increase the strength of the intermolecular forces between polymer chains, which can raise the glass transition temperature by increasing the energy required for the chains to move and rearrange.

(iv) Inter-chain interactions can also enhance the intermolecular forces between polymer chains, which can improve the cohesion and rigidity of the material, making it more crystalline.

First, let's calculate the molecular weight of one repeat unit. The degree of polymerization is the number of repeat units in the polymer, so the molecular weight of one repeat unit is the number-averaged molecular weight divided by the degree of polymerization:

Molecular weight of one repeat unit = Number-averaged molecular weight / Degree of polymerization

X-ray diffraction peak broadening is a common phenomenon observed in X-ray diffraction patterns. The width of the diffraction peaks provides valuable information about the crystalline structure of the material.

Next, we need to find the area of the (110) plane of the unit cell. The Miller indices (110) indicate that the plane is cutting through the b and c axes, and is parallel to the a axis. Therefore, the area of the (110) plane is given by:

Calculate the wavelength of the Xray used, in nm."," To calculate the wavelength of the X-rays using the given information, we can use Bragg's equation:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the angle of diffraction (2θ in this case).

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing for the {200} plane in an FCC lattice with a lattice parameter of 0.352 nm. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / √h² + k² + l²

where a is the lattice parameter and h, k, and l are the Miller indices.

For the {200} plane, h = 2, k = 0, and l = 0.

So,

d = 0.352 nm / √(2² + 0² + 0²) = 0.352 nm / √2 = 0.2289 nm

Now, we can use Bragg's equation to find the wavelength:

61.08° = 2θ

sinθ = h / (2d)

θ = sin⁻¹(h / (2d))

θ = sin⁻¹(2 / (2 * 0.2289 nm)) = 30.04°

nλ = 2 * 0.2289 nm * sin(30.04°)

nλ = 0.4143 nm * 0.5 * √3

nλ = 0.4143 nm * √3 / 2 ≈ 0.287 nm

Since this is a first-order diffraction, n = 1.

So, the wavelength of the X-rays is approximately 0.287 nm or 0.287 x 10⁻⁹ Joules / Hz.",,,0,

If the energy of formation of vacancies in pure copper is 0.9 ev, the fraction of vacancies pure copper at 27 ° C will be x * $10^(-16)$. Find x. ","To find the fraction of vacancies in pure copper at 27°C, we can use the following equation:

x = Nv/Nt

where Nv is the number of vacancies and Nt is the total number of atoms in the material. We can relate the number of vacancies to the energy of formation using the Boltzmann distribution.

The energy of formation of a vacancy is given as 0.9 eV. To convert this to Joules, we multiply by 1.602*$10^-19 J/eV:

0.9 eV * 1.602*$10^-19 J/eV = 1.441*$10^-18 J

Next, we can use the Boltzmann distribution to find the number of vacancies:

Nv = Nt * (exp(-Ef/kT))

where Ef is the energy of formation, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:

T = 27°C + 273.15 = 297.15 K

Now, we can substitute the values into the equation:

Nv = Nt * (exp(-1.441*$10^-18 J/8.62*$10^-5 eV/K * 297.15 K))

To simplify the calculation, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(Nv/Nt) = ln(exp(-1.441*$10^-18 J/(8.62*$10^-5 eV/K * 297.15 K)))

Using a calculator, we find:

ln(Nv/Nt) ≈ -12.91

To find the fraction x, we need to find Nv/Nt:

Nv/Nt = exp(ln(Nv/Nt)) = exp(-12.91)

Taking the exponent of both sides:

Nv/Nt ≈ 3.98*$10^-5

Finally, we can find x by dividing Nv by Nt:

x = Nv/Nt ≈ 3.98*$10^-5 * $10^(-16) = 3.98*$10^-21

So, the fraction of vacancies in pure copper at 27°C is approximately 3.98*$10^-21.",,,0,

When an inorganic material is doped with transition metal ions, the electronic energy levels of the host material can change significantly due to the presence of the dopant ions. This results in the material absorbing certain wavelengths of light that it was previously transparent to, causing the material to appear coloured.

For FCC lattice, the number of unique lattice planes is given by the Miller indices (hkl). The maximum number of observable peaks can be estimated using the following relation:

N = (a^2 * (h^2 + h*k + k^2)) / 2

where a is the lattice parameter, h, k, and l are the Miller indices.

For FCC aluminium with a lattice parameter of 0.405 nm and using Cr-Kα radiation of wavelength 0.229 nm, the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the pattern is:

N = (0.405^2 * (h^2 + h*k + k^2)) /  /

N = (0.1631 * (h^2 + h*k + k^2)) / 2

This is a diophantine equation, and the number of solutions depends on the specific values of h, k, and l. However, since aluminium has a simple FCC structure, the number of unique lattice planes is limited, and the maximum number of observable peaks is typically less than 10.

(give answer up to 2 decimal places).,"To find the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal, we first need to calculate the number of atoms in a unit cell and then divide it by the area of the (110) plane.

The BCC unit cell contains 2 atoms (1 atom + 1 atom). The volume of the unit cell is given as 0.023 55 nm³.

First, let's calculate the area of the (110) plane:

The Miller indices (hkl) of the (110) plane are h = 1, k = 1, and l = 0.

The area vector a in the BCC lattice is given as 0.287 nm.

The area of the (110) plane can be calculated using the following formula:

Area = |a₋h × a₋k × a₋l|

Since l = 0, the area of the (110) plane is:

Area = |a₋h × a₋k|

Area = |(0.287 nm) × (0.287 nm) × (0)|

Area = 0.145 888 9 nm² (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the number of atoms in the unit cell:

Since the unit cell contains 2 atoms, the number of atoms per unit cell is 2.

The planar atomic density in the (110) plane is the number of atoms per unit cell divided by the area of the (110) plane:

Atomic density = Number of atoms per unit cell / Area of the (110) plane

Atomic density = 2 / 0.145 888 9 nm²

d = 3.5 Å√2 ≈ 2.886 Å

Now, we can find the order of reflection n using Bragg's law:

The surface energies of {111} and {100} surfaces have different numbers of broken bonds per unit area.

The {111} surface has three layers of atoms exposed, while the {100} surface has only one layer. Therefore, the number of broken bonds per unit area for the {111} surface is three times that of the {100} surface.

Since the structure is face-centered cubic (fcc), each unit cell contains two iron atoms and one carbon atom.

Mass of 1 unit cell = (2 × 55.8 g/mol × 2) + (1 × 12.0 g/mol)

where $N$ is the number of vacancies, $N\_0$ is the total number of available sites, $E$ is the activation energy, $k\_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

First, we need to find the total number of available sites per mole of $CeO\_2$. Since $CeO\_2$ has a formula unit of $CeO\_2$, there are two oxygen atoms per formula unit. Therefore, the total number of available sites per mole is:

$$N\_0 = 2 \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} \times \frac{1}{1} = 1.204 \times 10^{24}$$

Now, we can calculate the number of oxygen vacancies using the Boltzmann distribution function:

To calculate the exponent, we need to convert the energy to Joules and then convert the temperature to Kelvin:

$$E = 4 \text{ eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} = 6.403 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

$$T = 1000 \text{ K} + 273.15 = 1273.15 \text{ K}$$

Grain size of the material is approximately  (A) 45 µm (B) 35 µm (C) 4.5 µm (D) 3.5 µm," To find the grain size of the material, we can use the Hall-Petch equation:

σy = σ0 + kd

σy is the yield strength,
σ0 is the lattice frictional stress,
k is the Hall-Petch constant, and
d is the grain size.

We are given σ0 = 100 MN/$m^2$ and k = 0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$. We need to find d.

First, we need to rearrange the equation to solve for d:

d = (σy - σ0) / k

Now, we can substitute the given values:

d = (σy - 100) / 0.10

To find σy, we can use the ASTM grain size number. The relationship between grain size and ASTM number is given by:

d = d0 * (2)^(ASN/10)

where:
d0 is the diameter of a sphere with a surface area equal to 1 cm², and
ASN is the ASTM grain size number.

For ASTM No. 6, we have:

d = d0 * (2)^(6/10)

Now, we need to find d0. The surface area of a sphere with a diameter of 1 cm is 12.57 cm², so d0 = 1 / (12.57 * 10^-4) = 80.32 * 10^-3 m = 0.0008032 m.

So,

d = 0.0008032 * (2)^(6/10) = 0.0008032 * 1.5625 = 0.001255 m = 1.255 mm

Atomic structure,55,G-META-13-54,MCQS-NUM,38,An edge dislocation is present in α-Fe. Atomic diameter of iron atom is 0.25 nm and its shear modulus is 70 GPa. Modulus of the Burgers vector (in nm) is  (A) 0.125 (B) 0.25 (C) 0.50 (D) 0.625 ,"The modulus of the Burgers vector (b) can be calculated using the formula: b = √(2 * γ / μ), where γ is the shear modulus and μ is the shear modulus in units of N/m².

Given that the atomic diameter of iron is 0.25 nm, the shear modulus is 70 GPa, and 1 GPa = 10^9 N/m², we have:

γ = 70 GPa = 70 * 10^9 N/m²
μ = 70 GPa = 70 * 10^9 N/m²

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

b = √(2 * γ / μ) = √(2 * (70 * 10^9 N/m²) / (70 * 10^9 N/m²)) = √(2) = 1.41

Since the Burgers vector is a vector, its magnitude can be expressed in any unit. In this case, it is given in nm, so we need to convert the result to nm:

b = 1.41 * 0.25 nm = 0.3525 nm

To find the modulus of the modulus of the Burgers vector, we take the absolute value of the above result:

|b| = 0.3525 nm

Atomic structure,56,G-META-13-55,MCQS-NUM,45,An edge dislocation is present in α-Fe. Atomic diameter of iron atom is 0.25 nm and its shear modulus is 70 GPa.

E = γbL

where γ is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector (which is equal to the atomic diameter for an edge dislocation), and L is the length of the dislocation.

First, we need to convert the atomic diameter from nanometers to meters:

b = 0.25 nm = 0.25 x 10^-9 m

Next, we can calculate the energy using the given values:

E = γbL
E = (70 GPa) x (0.25 x 10^-9 m) x  m) x L

To find the length L, we can use the fact that the Burgers vector is equal to the atomic diameter, so the number of atoms in the length L is equal to the length divided by the atomic diameter:

L = nb

where n is the number of atoms in the length L. Since we don't have a specific value for n, we can't calculate the exact energy. However, we can calculate the energy per unit length (also known as the line energy) by dividing the total energy by the length:

E/L = γb

Substituting the given values, we get:

E/L = (70 GPa) x (0.25 x 10^-9 m)
E/L = 17.5 x 10^(-11) J/m

To convert this to Joules, we can multiply by the length L:

E = (17.5 x 10^(-11) J/m) x L

Since we don't have a specific value for L, we can't calculate the exact energy. However, but we can compare the given options to find the closest answer.

Let's calculate the energy for each option and see which one is closest:

A) 0.5 x 10^(-9) J = 0.5 x 10^(-11) J
B) 1.1 x 10^(-9) J = 1.1 x 10^(-11) J
C) 2.2 x 10^(-9) J = 2.2 x 10^(-11) J
D) 4.4 x 10^(-9) J = 4.4 x 10^(-11) J

The closest answer is C) 2.2 x 10^(-11) J. However, since we don't have an exact value for the length L, this is only an approximation. The exact value would depend on the specific configuration of the dislocation in the crystal.",,,0,

In an fcc lattice, the interplanar spacing (d) can be calculated using the formula:

where a is the lattice constant. The lattice constant (a) of aluminium is related to its atomic radius (r) through the packing efficiency of spheres in the lattice. The packing efficiency of spheres in an fcc lattice is 74%. Therefore, the lattice constant (a) can be calculated as:

Substituting the given value of the atomic radius of aluminium (1.431 Å), we get:

a = √2 × 1.431 Å × (2/√3 × 100%) / 74%
a ≈ 4.049 Å

Since the strain energy per unit length is the energy per unit length of the dislocation, we have:

The Burgers vector is (a/2)[1 1 0], and the slip direction is [112]. We need to find the direction cosines of both vectors and then use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle between them.

u = 1
v = 1
w = 0

Now, let's find the direction cosines of the slip direction:

v' = 2
w' = 0

To find the cosine of the angle between the Burgers vector and the slip direction, we can use the dot product:

cos(θ) = u * u' + v * v' + w * w'

Substituting the values:

cos(θ) = 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 0
cos(θ) = 1 + 1

First, we need to find the mass of one unit cell. We know that the density is the mass per unit volume, so:

Mass of one unit cell = Density × Volume of one unit cell

The volume of one unit cell can be calculated using the lattice parameter:

Volume of one unit cell = (Lattice parameter)³

Substituting the given values:

Mass of one unit cell = 19000 kg.$m^(-3)$ × (0.4 nm)³
Mass of one unit cell = 1.3333 × 10⁻⁶ kg

Now, we can find the number of atoms in one unit cell by dividing the mass of one unit cell by the atomic weight:

Number of atoms in one unit cell = Mass of one unit cell / Atomic weight

Number of atoms in one unit cell = 1.3333 × 10⁻⁶ kg / 183 kg/$m^3$
Number of atoms in one unit cell ≈ 7.29 × 10⁻⁶

Therefore, the slip systems listed in the options do not directly relate to the given context. However, we can use the information about the ideal c/a ratio and the fact that basal slip occurs at room temperature in hcp metals to make an educated guess.

The ideal c/a ratio for hcp metals is 1.633. Zn has a larger c/a ratio of 1.856. This means that the c-axis is more extended than it would be in an ideal hcp lattice. This can make slip systems that involve a larger component in the c-direction more favorable.

The slip systems listed in the options all have a component in the c-direction, but the slip direction in the basal plane is different for each option.

d111 ≈ 0.2066 nm

Now we can use Bragg's equation to find the wavelength:

nλ = 2dsinθ
nλ = 2 * 0.2066 nm * sin(21.68°)

Reason [r]: Atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries.

Explanation:

The assertion [a] is true that the rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution of B in A is controlled by the diffusivity of B. However, the reason [r] is not correct. Atomic migration can occur along dislocations and grain boundaries through various diffusion mechanisms such as vacancy diffusion, interstitial diffusion, and grain boundary diffusion.

Atomic structure,82,G-META-21-15,NUM,60,Given: For the symmetric distribution: Probability P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98. The grain size (X) of annealed specimens follows a symmetric distribution with a mean (µ) of 5µm and a standard deviation (σ) of 0.5 µm. The percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is expected to be?(round off to nearest integer) ,"To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm, we first need to calculate the value of µ + 2σ.

µ = 5 µm
σ = 0.5 µm

µ + 2σ = 5 µm + 2 × 0.5 µm = 5.5 µm

Now, we need to find the proportion of the distribution that falls within µ + 2σ. Since the distribution is symmetric, we can use the z-score corresponding to the given probability (P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98) and find the width of the interval that contains 98% of the data.

The z-score for a probability of 0.98 is approximately 1.282.

Using the z-score table or a calculator, we can find that the width of the interval that contains 98% of the data is approximately 2σ.

So, the width of the interval that contains 98% of the data is 2 × 0.5 µm = 1 µm.

The grain size range that contains 98% of the data is (µ - σ to µ + σ) or (4.5 µm to 5.5 µm).

To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm, we need to find the proportion of the distribution that falls within this range.

The proportion of the distribution that falls within the range 5 to 6 µm is:

(6 µm - 5 µm) / (5.5 µm - 4.5 µm) = 1 µm / 1 µm = 1

So, 100% of the specimens have grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm. However, since the question asks for the percentage, not the proportion, we need to multiply this value by 100.

Therefore, the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is 100% × 1 = 100%.

On which plane do these two partial dislocaitons lie?  (A) (-1 1 1) (B) (1 1 1) (C) (1 -1 1) (D) (1 1 -1),"The given equation describes the dissociation of a dislocation with Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0] into two partial dislocations in an FCC metal. The Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations are (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1].

To determine on which plane these partial dislocations lie, we need to find the planes where the given Burgers vectors are normal to the plane.

The normal vector of a plane is given by the cross product of two vectors lying in the plane. For example, the normal vector of the (1 1 1) plane is given by the cross product of [1 1 0] and [0 0 1].

Let's find the normal vectors of the planes (A) (-1 1 1), (B) (1 1 1 1), (C) (1 -1 1), and (D) (1 1 -1).

(A) The normal vector of the (-1 1 1) plane is given by the cross product of [1 1 0] and [1 -1 0].

(B) The normal vector of the (1 1 1) plane is given by the cross product of [1 1 0] and [0 0 1].

(C) The normal vector of the (1 -1 1) plane is given by the cross product of [1 1 0] and [0 0 -1].

(D) The normal vector of the (1 1 -1) plane is given by the cross product of [1 1 0] and [0 0 -1].

Now, let's find the dot product of each normal vector with the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations. The partial dislocation with Burgers vector (a/6)[2 -1 1] lies on the plane whose normal vector has a positive dot product with this Burgers vector. Similarly, the partial dislocation with Burgers vector (a/6)[1 -2 -1] lies on the plane whose normal vector has a negative dot product with this Burgers vector.

The dot product of the normal vector of the (-1 1 1) plane and the Burgers vector (a/6)[2 -1 1] is negative.

The dot product of the normal vector of the (1 1 1) plane and the Burgers vector (a/6)[2 -1 1] is positive.

The dot product of the normal vector of the (1 -1 1) plane and the Burgers vector (a/6)[1 -2 -1] is negative.

The dot product of the normal vector of the (1 1 -1) plane and the Burgers vector (a/6)[1 -2 -1] is positive.

Therefore, the partial dislocation with Burgers vector (a/6)[2 -1 1] lies on the (1 1 1) plane, and the partial dislocation with Burgers vector (a/6)[1 -2 -1] lies on the (-1 1 1) plane.

(answer up to two decimal places),"To find the Bragg angle θ for the second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC metal, we can use the Bragg equation:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength of X-rays, d is the interplanar spacing, and sinθ is the sine of the angle of incidence.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d. In a FCCu, the interplanetary spacing is given by:

d = a /√2

where a is the lattice parameter.

Substituting the given value of the lattice parameter, we have:

d = 0.36 nm /√2 ≈ 0.215 nm

To find the angle of incidence θ, we can use the inverse sine function:

The number of atoms per unit area($nm^(-2)$) in (100) plane of Pb is?(round off to the nearest integer).","To find the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of an FCC crystal, we can use the following formula:

Number of atoms per unit area = (Number of atoms in the unit cell) / (Area of the unit cell)

First, let's calculate the area of the unit cell in the (100) plane. The side length of the cube in an FCC lattice is given by definition as a = a0 (where a0 is the edge length of the cube). So, the area of the (100) plane is:

Area = a^2

Now, we can find the number of atoms in the unit cell:

Number of atoms = N

In an FCC lattice, N = 4 (atoms at the corners) + 1 (atom at the center) = 5

So, the number of atoms per unit area is:

Number of atoms per unit area = 5 / a^2

Substituting the given value of a0 = 0.3839 nm, we get:

Number of atoms per unit area = 5 / (0.3839 nm)^2

Calculating the value, we get:

Number of atoms per unit area ≈ 1.48 × 10^15 nm^-2

However, since we are asked to round off the answer to the nearest integer, we cannot provide an exact answer. But, we can say that the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb is approximately on the order of 10^15 nm^-2.

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength of X-rays, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the Bragg angle.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d using the given data:

θ = 24.65° = 24.6536° = 1.41506 radians
n = 1 (since it's the first peak)

Using the Bragg's equation:

1 × 0.1543nm = 2d × sin(1.41506)

Solving for d:

d = 0.2458nm

Now, we can use the Scherrer equation to find the crystallite size D:

D = 0.9λ/Bcosθ

where B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak. However, the FWHM value is not given in the problem.

Therefore, we can only find the lattice parameter a using the interplanar spacing d and the fact that in an FCC lattice, the interplanar spacing for the (111) plane is given by:

a = d111 / √2

The Bragg angle(in degree) for the second reflection will be?(round off to 1 decimal places)","To find the Bragg angle for the second reflection, we can use the fact that the spacing between planes in an FCC crystal with (hkl) Miller indices follows the relationship h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = p^2, where p is the number of planes per unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the (hkl) planes. For the first reflection, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 1, so p = √2.

Using Bragg's law, nλ = 2dsinθ, where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, and d is the spacing between the planes, we can find the spacing between the planes for the first reflection:

d = λ / (2sin(30°)) = λ / (2 * √3/2) = λ / (√3)

Since the second reflection has the same plane spacing but a higher order of reflection, we can find its Bragg angle by solving for the angle that satisfies the equation:

2dsinθ = nλ

Substituting the value of d and the fact that n = 2 for the second reflection, we get:

2 * (λ / √3) * sinθ = 2 * λ

Solving for sinθ, we get:

sinθ = √3 / 2

To find the angle in degrees, we can use the inverse sine function:

The enthalpy (in KJ $mol^(-1)$) of vacancy formation is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ,"To find the enthalpy of vacancy formation, we can use the given information about the change in vacancy concentration and the constant-volume heat capacity (Cv) of the crystal. The change in enthalpy is equal to the product of the molar heat capacity and the change in temperature, multiplied by the number of moles of vacancies:

ΔH = Cv × ΔT × n

where ΔH is the enthalpy change, Cv is the constant-volume heat capacity, ΔT is the change in temperature, and n is the number of moles of vacancies.

First, we need to find the change in temperature, which is given as 100°C (from 27°C to 127°C). We can convert this to Kelvin:

ΔT = 100°C × (1°C/1K) = 100 × 1.8 = 180 K

Next, we need to find the number of moles of vacancies. Since the vacancy concentration doubles, we can assume that there are twice as many vacancies in the crystal at the higher temperature as there were at the lower temperature. Let's call the number of moles of vacancies at 27°C x. Then, the number of moles of vacancies at 127°C is 2x.

The relationship between the vacancy concentration and the number of moles of vacancies is given by:

n = N × c

where n is the number of moles of vacancies, N is the total number of atoms in the crystal, and c is the vacancy concentration.

At 27°C, the vacancy concentration is given as:

c1 = 1/2

Since the crystal is assumed to be pure, the total number of atoms in the crystal is equal to the number of moles of the substance. Let's call this number N. Then, the number of moles of vacancies at 27°C is:

(a) The amount of heat required to increase the temperature of one mole of solid aluminum from 300 to 800 K at constant pressure of 1 bar is:

Q = m × Cp × ΔT

The mass of one mole of solid aluminum is 28.97 g. The specific heat capacity of solid aluminum is given as 20.67 + 12.38 × 10−3T J/(mol K ). We can find the specific heat capacity at 800 K by interpolating between the given values:

Cp(800 K) = 20.67 + 12.38 × 10−3 × 800 = 21.31 J/(mol K )

The change in temperature is ΔT = 500 K.

Q = (1 mol) × (21.31 J/(mol K )) × (500 K) = 10,655 J/mol = 10.66 kJ/mol

(b) The enthalpy change of one mole of Al when it is heated from 298 to 1200 K at 1 bar is:

Creep resistance is the ability of a material to resist deformation under sustained load and high temperatures. A high melting point helps to limit the number of atomic vibrations, reducing the likelihood of atomic movements that can lead to creep deformation. Cold working a microstructure increases the dislocation density, which acts as obstacles to the movement of dislocations, making it more difficult for creep deformation to occur. Therefore, both a high melting point and a cold worked microstructure are desirable for achieving better creep resistance in a material for high temperature applications.",,,0,
Atomic structure,99,G-META-22-50,NUM,38,Consider a tilt boundary of misorientation of 2° in an aluminium grain. The lattice parameter of aluminium is 0.143 nm. The spacing(in nm) between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ," The spacing between the dislocations that form a tilt boundary is given by the Burger's vector and the misorientation angle. In this case, it's a tilt boundary, so the Burger's vector is given by the cross product of the normal vector of the tilt boundary and the displacement vector in the direction perpendicular to the boundary.

The normal vector of a tilt boundary is given by the cross product of two crystallographic directions, in this case, [011] and [112]. The displacement vector is given by the misorientation angle in radians, which is 0.0349 radians for a 2° misorientation.

So, the Burger's vector is:

B = [011] x [112]

Using the right-hand rule, the cross product results in a vector in the [110] direction. The magnitude of the Burger's vector is given by:

|B| = |[011]| * |sin(θ/2)|

where θ is the misorientation angle. In this case, θ = 2 * 180 / π = 3.712 radians.

|B| = |[011]| * |sin(3.712/2)|

|B| = 0.143 nm * 0.573 = 0.081 nm

The spacing between the dislocations is twice the magnitude of the Burger's vector:

For the steel bar:
Elastic strain (ε) = F / (A * E)
where F = 20 kN = 20,000 N, A = 8 cm² = 8 × 10⁴ m², and Eₕₒₕ = 200 GPa = 200 × 10⁹ Pa.

εₕ = 20,000 N / (8 × 10⁴ m² × 200 × 10⁹ Pa) = 1 × 10⁻³

For the aluminium bar:
We know that the elastic strain is the same for both materials, so:

εₗ = 1 × 10⁻³

Now we can find the cross-sectional area of the aluminium bar:

Aₗ = F / (εₗ * Eₗ)

where Eₗ = 70 GPa = 70 × 10⁹ Pa.

Aₗ = 20,000 N / (1 × 10⁻³ × 70 × 10⁹ Pa) = 28,571,429 m²

Explanation:

Young's modulus (P) is a measure of the material's elasticity and is not directly related to the mobile dislocation density. It is determined by the slope of the stress-strain curve for small strains.

Yield strength (Q) is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically and is related to the mobile dislocation density through the dislocation density's effect on the material's ability to resist plastic deformation.

Ductility (S) is the ability of a material to undergo plastic deformation without breaking and is also related to the mobile dislocation density. A higher dislocation density can lead to increased ductility due to the ability of dislocations to move and interact with each other, allowing for more plastic deformation before fracture.

Fracture toughness (R) is a measure of a material's resistance to fracture and is not directly related to the mobile dislocation density. It is determined by the material's ability to absorb energy prior to fracture and is influenced by factors such as grain size, microstructure, and the presence of defects.",,,0,

Young's modulus of composite = Volume fraction of fibers * Young's modulus of fibers + Volume fraction of matrix * Young's modulus of matrix

We are given the Young's modulus of the composite and the Young's moduli of the fibers and matrix. We need to find the volume fraction of fibers.

First, let's calculate the volume fraction of the matrix:

Volume fraction of matrix = 1 - Volume fraction of fibers

We can rearrange the equation for Young's modulus of composite to solve for the volume fraction of fibers:

Volume fraction of fibers = (Young's modulus of composite - Volume fraction of matrix * Young's modulus of matrix) / (Young's modulus of fibers)

Substituting the given values:

Volume fraction of fibers = (185 GPa - (1 - x) * 110 GPa) / 360 GPa

where x is the volume fraction of the matrix.

To find x, we can use the fact that the total volume of the composite is the sum of the volumes of the fibers and the matrix:

Total volume = Volume of fibers + Volume of matrix

Since the density of the fibers is typically higher than that of the matrix, the volume fraction of fibers is usually less than 50%. Let's assume a reasonable value for the volume fraction of the matrix, such as 50%.

x = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Substituting this value back into the equation for the volume fraction of fibers:

Volume fraction of fibers = (185 GPa - (1 - 0.5) * 110 GPa) / 360 GPa

","To answer the question, we need to determine the given context, the Hall-Petch relationship for the Cantor alloy is 494 MPa μm−1/2, and the yield strength increases as the grain size decreases. However, the context does not provide enough information to directly determine the expected yield strength when the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm.

Additionally, the context mentions that the Hall-Petch slope decreases in the nanocrystalline grain size regime for Cantor alloy, similar to conventional FCC metals and alloys. This decrease in the Hall-Petch slope could affect the expected yield strength.

However, we can estimate that the yield strength will continue to increase as the grain size decreases, but the rate of increase may be less than what was observed between 256 μm and 64 μm due to the decrease in the Hall-Petch slope in the nanocrystalline grain size regime.

No change in enthalpy, but change in the entropy.

Explanation:

The elasticity of an ideal rubber is primarily due to the change in entropy as a result of the molecular configuration changes. The rubber molecules have a disordered, coiled state at room temperature, and when stretched, they transition to a more ordered, extended state. This increase in disorder (or entropy) allows the rubber to return to its original state when the force is removed.

During the aging of an Al-homogenized Cu alloy below the GP zone solvus, the hardness initially increases due to the precipitation of CuAl2 particles.

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What is the relaxation time constant for this material?","To find the relaxation time constant, we can use the given information about the initial stress, final stress, and time. The stress relaxation function follows a stretched exponential form with a relaxation time constant (τ) and a stretching exponent (b). The value of b is given as 3/5 in the context.

From the context, we know that the stress relaxation function collapses onto a master curve when normalized by the initial stress (s(0)). Therefore, we can write the following equation:

s(t) / s(0) = e^(-t/τ)

We have the initial stress (s(0) = 10 MPa) and the final stress (s(t) = 5 MPa) after 40 days. We can find the relaxation time constant (τ) by solving for it.

First, we need to find the time (t) in seconds:

t = 40 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 52,080,000 seconds

Now, we can set up the equation:

5 MPa / 10 MPa = e^(-t/τ)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.5) = ln(e) - ln(e) * t/τ

Using the value of ln(e) = 1:

ln(0.5) = 1 - ln(e) * t/τ

Solving for τ:

τ = t * ln(2)

Substituting the value of t:

τ = 52,080,000 seconds * ln(2) ≈ 163,840,000 seconds

Converting seconds to hours:

τ ≈ 18,110 hours ≈ 755 days

From the context, we know that the relaxation time for the elastomer is 1980 seconds or approximately 33 minutes. We are given that after 40 days at 20°C, the stress has decreases(5 MPa). We can find the initial stress, s(0), by using the given strain of 50% and Hooke's law, which relates stress and strain: s(0) = Eε, where E is the elastic modulus and ε is the strain.

From the context, we know that the elastic modulus of the elastomer is 0.72 GPa or 720 MPa. Therefore, s(0) = 720 MPa × 0.5 = 3600 MPa.


Now we can find the stress after 60 days at 20°C by using the stress relaxation equation:

s(60 days) = s(0)e^(-60 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour × 60 seconds/minute/3600 seconds/hour/1980 seconds)

s(60 days) = 3600 MPa × e^(-(20°C × 273.15 K/273.15 K × 1 day/365.25 days × 1 hour/24 hours × 1 minute/60 minutes/1980 minutes))

- a = 30 μm = 30 × 10⁻⁶ m

We want to find σf for a = 90 μm = 90 × 10⁻⁶ m.

First, we need to calculate the ratio a/w. Since w is assumed to be infinite, a/w = a/∞ = 0.

Now, we can substitute the given and calculated values into the equation:

σf = 300 MPa√m / (1 + (30 × 10⁻⁶ m / ∞)²)

Since a/w = 0, the denominator becomes 1, and we can simplify the equation:

However, if we want to find the fracture stress for a finite width w, we need to use a different equation:

According to the parallel composition rule for elasticity, the Young's modulus in the given direction can be calculated as the weighted average of the Young's moduli of the matrix and fibers, where the weights are their respective volume fractions of the composite.

(A) Fine grained equiaxed (B) Coarse grained equiaxed (C) Columnar (D) Single crystal,"The answer to this question depends on the specific Ni-base superalloy in question and the conditions under which creep resistance is being evaluated. In general, fine-grained equiaxed microstructures can provide good creep resistance due to the Hall-Petch effect, which states that the yield strength of a material increases with decreasing grain size. However, other factors such as the presence of secondary phases, grain shape, and processing history can also significantly impact creep resistance. Columnar microstructures, which are often formed through directional solidification or other processing techniques, can provide good creep resistance in certain applications due to the grain alignment and the presence of strengthening secondary phases at grain boundaries. Single crystal microstructures, which are free of grain boundaries, can provide the highest creep resistance in some cases, but are also more difficult and expensive to produce. Ultimately, the choice of microstructure for a Ni-base superalloy with the highest creep resistance will depend on the specific application requirements and the processing capabilities available.

Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question with the given context.

Mechanical,30,G-META-14-9,NUM,36,A tensile specimen was deformed at a constant crosshead speed of 6 mm/min. The strain rate at the start of the testing was 5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$. The initial gauge length of the specimen (in mm) was?," To find the initial gauge length of the specimen, we can use the given strain rate and crosshead speed to calculate the engineering strain rate and then use the strain-time relationship to find the length at the given time.

First, let's calculate the engineering strain:

Engineering strain = Strain rate * Time
Engineering strain = 5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1) * 60s
Engineering strain = 0.3

Now, we need to find the true strain rate at this engineering strain. Since the context does not provide the true strain-engineering strain relationship for the given material, we cannot directly calculate the true strain rate. However, we can assume that the material follows the Hollomon parabolic true stress-strain relationship given in the context of question 2.Ex.7.

True strain rate = (3/2) * Engineering strain rate * (Strain hardening coefficient)
True strain rate = (3/2) * 0.3 * 0.35
True strain rate = 0.0455 $10^(-3)s^(-1)$

Now, we can use the true strain-time relationship to find the length of the specimen at the given time:

True strain = sqrt(1 + 3 * True strain rate * Time) - 1

We don't have the true strain rate-time data for the given material, but we can assume that the material follows the power law relationship:

True strain rate = A * (Stress)^(n)

where A and n are material constants. We can use the given engineering stress (50 MPa) and the true strain rate we calculated earlier to find A and n.

A = True strain rate / (Stress)^n
A = 0.0455 $10^(-3)s^(-1)$ / (50 MPa)^n

n = log(True strain rate / A) / log(Stress)
n = log(0.0455 $10^(-3)s^(-1)$ / (50 MPa)^(-1)) / log(50 MPa)
n = 0.35

Now, we can find the true strain at the given time:

True strain = sqrt(1 + 3 * 0.0455 $10^(-3)s^(-1) * 60s * 50 MPa^0.35) - 1
True strain = 0.153

Finally, we can find the length of the specimen at the given time using the initial length (L0) and the true strain:

Length = L0 * (1 + True strain)

We don't have the initial length (L0) given in the context, so we cannot directly calculate the answer. However, we can assume a reasonable value for L0 based on the given information. For example, if we assume L0 = 100 mm, then:

Length = 100 mm * (1 + 0.153)
Length = 115.3 mm

So, the answer is approximately 115.3 mm. However, this answer may not be accurate without knowing the exact value of L0.",,,0,

Explanation: The given context states that a grain boundary has a surface tension, T (= surface-free energy per unit area) because its atoms have a higher free energy than those within the grains.

εt = ln(Lf/Lo)

where:
εt = true strain = 0.405
Lf = final gauge length
Lo = original gauge length

We know that the change in gauge length is 5 mm, so:

Lf = Lo + ΔL

What is the yield strength of the material, in MPa, if Tresca yield criterion is obeyed?"," To find the yield strength of the material based on the Tresca yield criterion, we need to determine the maximum shear stress in the given stress state. The Tresca yield criterion states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches the yield strength.

First, let's calculate the principal stresses and the maximum shear stress using Mohr's circle:

1. Calculate the deviatoric stresses:
σ1' = (σ1 - σ2)/3 = (250 MPa - 50 MPa)/3 = 75 MPa
σ2' = (σ1 - σ3)/3 = (250 MPa - (-50 MPa))/3 = 175 MPa
σ3' = (σ2 - σ1)/3 = (50 MPa - 250 MPa)/3 = -125 MPa

2. Plot Mohr's circle:
Draw a circle with center at (0, 0) and radius R = sqrt(3/2) * max(|σ1'|, |σ2'|, |σ3'|) = sqrt(3/2) * max(75 MPa, 175 MPa, 125 MPa) = sqrt(3/2) * 175 MPa.

3. Find the maximum shear stress:
The maximum shear stress is given by the intercept of the horizontal axis with the Mohr's circle. The horizontal axis corresponds to the stress difference σ1' - σ3'. So, the maximum shear stress is |σ1' - σ3'| = |75 MPa + 125 MPa| = 150 MPa.

4. Find the yield strength:
According to the Tresca yield criterion, yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches the yield strength. So, the yield strength is equal to the maximum shear stress, which is 150 MPa.

Engineering strain = (Stress - Young's modulus * Strain energy density) / Young's modulus

First, we need to find the strain energy density when the rod is under a stress of 400 MPa. We can use the definition of strain energy density:

Strain energy density = (1/2) * Stress * Strain

Since we are dealing with elastic deformation only, the strain is the engineering strain, which is given as:

Engineering strain = Stress / Young's modulus

Now, we can find the strain:

Strain = Stress / Young's modulus = 400 MPa / 200 GPa = 2%

Using this value, we can find the strain energy density:

Strain energy density = (1/2) * Stress * Strain = (1/2) * 400 MPa * 0.02 = 4 J/m³

Now, we can find the elastic strain:

Elastic strain = (Stress - Young's modulus * Strain energy density) / Young's modulus = (400 MPa - 200 GPa * 4 J/m³) / 200 GPa = 1.996%

The densities of glass fibre and epoxy are $2.58 g/cm^3$ and 1.14 $g/cm^3$, respectively.","To find the elastic modulus of the composite along the fiber direction, we can use the rule of mixtures. The rule of mixtures states that the elastic modulus of a composite is given by:

E\_composite = V\_fiber \* E\_fiber + V\_matrix \* E\_matrix

where:
- E\_fiber is the elastic modulus of the fiber,
- E\_matrix is the elastic modulus of the matrix,
- V\_fiber is the volume fraction of the fiber, and
- V\_matrix is the volume fraction of the matrix.

First, we need to find the volume fraction of the fiber and the matrix:

V\_matrix = wt\_matrix / (wt\_fiber + wt\_matrix)

where:
- wt\_fiber is the weight fraction of the fiber, and
- wt\_matrix is the weight fraction of the matrix.

Given that the weight fraction of the fiber is 60%, we have:

wt\_matrix = 0.4 \* (density\_matrix \* volume)

where:
- density\_fiber is the density of the fiber,
- density\_matrix is the density of the matrix, and
- volume is the total volume of the composite.

We are given the densities of the fiber and the matrix, so we can calculate their weight fractions and then find the volume fraction of the fiber:

wt\_fiber = 0.6 \* (2.58 g/cm^3 \* volume)

Explanation:

1. Intergranular fracture: This type of fracture occurs when the fracture surface is predominantly located at the grain boundaries. It is typically associated with brittle materials and can be caused by various factors such as corrosion, high temperatures, or the presence of second-phase particles. Intergranular fracture surfaces do not exhibit any of the features listed in Group I.
2. Cleavage fracture: This type of fracture occurs when the material separates along specific crystallographic planes. It is typically associated with brittle materials and is characterized by flat, smooth fracture surfaces with distinct steps or facets. Cleavage fracture surfaces can exhibit river markings, which are parallel lines or ridges that form due to the propagation of cracks along specific crystallographic planes. However, they do not typically exhibit striations or dimples.
3. Ductile fracture: This type of fracture occurs when the material undergoes plastic deformation prior to failure. It is typically associated with ductile materials and is characterized by dimples and microvoids on the fracture surface. Ductile fracture surfaces may also exhibit striations, which are caused by the deformation bands that form during plastic deformation.
4. Fatigue fracture: This type of fracture occurs when a material fails under cyclic loading. It is characterized by the presence of cracks that initiate and propagate over time due to the cyclic loading. Fatigue fracture surfaces can exhibit various features, including striations, dimples, and jagged surfaces with grain-like features.

This material has a fracture strength of 300 MPa for a given flaw size. The same solid containing the same flaws is then tested in medium Q in which $𝛾_𝑠$= 0.1 J $m^(-2)$. The fracture strength (in MPa) in medium Q based on Griffith's theory is?," According to Griffith's theory, the fracture toughness (KIC) is related to the surface energy ($𝛾_𝑠$) and the elastic modulus ($E$) through the following equation:

KIC = (𝛾_𝑠 * E) ^ (1/2)

Given that the material has a fracture strength of 300 MPa in medium P with a surface energy of 0.9 J $m^(-2)$, we can calculate the fracture toughness in medium P:

KIC_P = (0.9 J/m^2 * 70 GPa) ^ (1/2) = 11.2 MPa * m^(1/2) = 3.33 MPa * m^(3/2)

Now, we want to find the fracture toughness in medium Q with a surface energy of 0.1 J $m^(-2)$. Using the same equation, we can calculate the fracture toughness in medium Q:

KIC_Q = (0.1 J/m^2 * 70 GPa) ^ (1/2) = 0.447 MPa * m^(1/2) = 0.142 MPa * m^(3/2)

To find the fracture strength in medium Q, we need to use the relationship between the fracture toughness and the fracture strength:

σ_f = KIC / (1 + η) * (1 - a/W) ^ (1/2)

where η is the geometry factor, a is the flaw size, and W is the width of the specimen. Since the flaw size and the width of the specimen are not given, we cannot directly calculate the fracture strength in medium Q. However, we can calculate the ratio of the fracture strengths in medium P and Q:

σ_f,Q / σ_f,P = (KIC_Q / KIC_P) ^ 2

(σ_f,Q / σ_f,P) ^ 2 = (0.142 MPa * m^(3/2) / 3.33 MPa * m^(3/2)) ^ 2 = 0.0315

However, it also makes the material more susceptible to creep deformation, as dislocations can more easily cross twin boundaries and bypass dispersoids, reducing the material's creep resistance.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Low stacking fault energy.",,,0,

Ep = elastic modulus of polymer = 3.5 GPa

The ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is? (answer up to three decimal places)," To find the ratio of resilience to toughness for a perfectly elastic-plastic material, we first need to calculate the modulus of resilience and toughness separately.

Modulus of Resilience (Ur):
Ur = (1/2) * E * (εyield)^2

Substituting the given values:
Ur = (1/2) * 4.5 GPa * (0.45)^2
Ur = 0.13675 GPa

Toughness (T):

T = 0.2025 GPa

If the composite is subjected to longitudinal loading (iso-strain condition and assuming elastic response), what is the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement rounded off to two decimal places?","To find the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement, we can use the rule of mixtures for elastic moduli, which can be extended to the case of stresses:

$𝜏\_𝑓 = \dfrac{𝜏\_𝑓 \times V\_𝑓}{𝜏\_𝑓 \times V\_𝑓 + 𝜏\_𝑚 \times V\_𝑚}$

where $𝜏\_𝑓$ is the stress in the fiber, $𝜏\_𝑚$ is the stress in the matrix, $V\_𝑓$ is the volume fraction of fibers, and $V\_𝑚$ is the volume fraction of the matrix.

First, we need to find the stress in the fiber and the matrix. We can use Hooke's law to find the stress in each phase based on their respective Young's moduli and the applied load:

$𝜏\_𝑓 = \dfrac{𝐸\_𝑓 \times 𝜗}{𝐸\_𝑓}$
$𝜏\_𝑚 = \dfrac{𝐸\_𝑚 \times 𝜗}{𝐸\_𝑚}$

where $𝜗$ is the applied load per unit volume.

Since we are given the load per unit area ($12~kN$) and the cross-sectional area ($150~mm^2$), we can find the load per unit volume:

$𝜗 = \dfrac{12~kN}{150~mm^2} = \dfrac{12~kN}{150~000~mm^3} = \dfrac{0.00008~kPa}{mm^3}$

Now, we can find the stresses in the fiber and the matrix:

$𝜏\_𝑓 = \dfrac{250~GPa \times 0.00008~kPa}{mm^3}}{250~GPa} = \dfrac{2~MPa}{𝑓}$
$𝜏\_𝑚 = \approx \dfrac{2.5~GPa \times 0.00008~kPa}{mm^3}}{2.5~GPa} = \dfrac{0.00032~MPa}{𝑚}$

Next, we can find the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement:

$𝜏\_𝑓 \times V\_𝑓 = 𝜏\_𝑓 \times 0.25 = 0.5~MPa$
$𝜏\_𝑚 \times V\_𝑚 = 𝜏\_𝑚 \times (1-0.25) = 0.1875~MPa$
$𝜏\_𝑓 \times V\_𝑓 + 𝜏\_𝑚 \times V\_𝑚 = 0.5~MPa + 0.1875~MPa = 0.6875~MPa$
$𝜏\_𝑓 \times V\_𝑓 / (𝜏\_𝑓 \times V\_𝑓 + 𝜏\_𝑚 \times V\_𝑚) = \dfrac{0.5~MPa}{0.6875~MPa} = 0.725$

Therefore, the answer is (B) smaller grain size and lower temperature.

Explanation:

The Nabarro-Herring mechanism and the Coble mechanism are two different dislocation creep mechanisms that operate in metals under constant load and elevated temperatures.

The Nabarro-Herring mechanism involves the diffusion of vacancies to the grain boundaries, where they recombine and form dislocation loops, which in turn cause the grain to creep. This mechanism is favored in materials with smaller grain sizes and lower temperatures, as the shorter grain boundaries facilitate the diffusion of vacancies to the grain boundaries.

On the other hand, the Coble mechanism involves the diffusion of vacancies along the grain boundaries, which causes the dislocation pile-up at the grain boundaries to move forward, leading to grain creep. This mechanism is favored in materials with larger grain sizes and higher temperatures, as the longer grain boundaries provide more sites for dislocation pile-ups to form and move.

Therefore, the given context inference that the Cantor alloys show an approximately weak effect of strain rate on the yield strength at the quasi-static strain rate for the grain size of ∼ 35 μm, which is the representative of almost all FCC metals and alloys, and that Dongre and Salunkhe [18] conducted a study on the outcome of deformation temperature on 6061 aluminium alloy at low strain rates and temperatures, supports the fact that smaller grain sizes and lower temperatures favor the Nabarro-Herring mechanism over the Coble mechanism.

The stress intensity factor (K) is proportional to the square root of the crack length, so the fracture strength (σc) is inversely proportional to the square root of the crack length. Therefore, we have:

σc₁ ∝ 1/√(c₁)
σc₂ ∝ 1/√(c₂)

From the given information, we have c₁ have c₁ = 0.5 mm and c₂ = 2 mm. Therefore, we can calculate the ratio of the fracture strengths as:

σc₁ / σc₂ = (1/√(c₁)) / (1/√(c₂)) = √(c₂) / √(c₁)

Substituting the values, we get:

σc₁ / σc₂ = √(2 mm) / √(0.5 mm) = √2 ≈ 1.41

Since the fracture strength is inversely proportional to the square root of the crack length, a longer crack corresponds to a lower fracture strength. Therefore, the ratio of the fracture strengths is less than 1.

So, the answer is (B) 1.0, but the actual ratio is closer to 0.79 (1/√(2) ≈ 0.79). However, the given options do not include this value, so the closest option is (B) 1.0.

m * g * h = 0.5 * m * v^2

v = sqrt(2 * g * h)

First, let's find the initial spacing between dislocation lines (λ) when the shear stress is 100 MPa:

λ = 2ρ^(-1/2)

Given that the dislocation density (ρ) is determined by the spacing between precipitates (2λ), we can write:

2λ = 0.2 µm

During tensile testing, necking instability occurs when the cross-sectional area of the specimen reduces to a point where the strain rate becomes infinitely large.

The text also states that during necking instability, the material undergoes strain hardening, which means that the material's resistance to deformation increases with increasing strain. Therefore, the true stress (σ) increases as the true strain (ϵ) increases.

Given that the true stress (σ) and true strain (ϵ) are related, and that the true strain (ϵ) increases during necking instability, it follows that the rate of change of the true stress (𝑑𝜎) with respect to the true strain (𝑑𝜖) must be equal to the true strain (ϵ).

First, let's find the expression for ε in terms of σ:

σ = 1050 * $ε^{0.25}$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

ln(σ) = ln(1050) + (0.25) * ln(ε)

Now, we can solve for ε by rearranging the equation:

ε = (σ / 1050) ^ (1 / 0.25)

To find the maximum value of ε, we need to find the maximum value of σ. Since the expression for σ is a power function of ε, the maximum value of σ occurs when ε is the value that makes the exponent (0.25) equal to 1.

$K_{1c} = \sigma \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{\pi}$

We are given the value of $K_{1c}$ and the applied Mode-I stress ($\sigma$). We need to find the crack length (a).

First, we'll isolate the crack length (a) in the equation:

$a = \dfrac{K_{1c}^2}{\pi \sigma^2}$

$a = \dfrac{(45 \text{ MPa}\sqrt{\text{m}})^2}{\pi (400 \text{ MPa})^2}$

Calculate the square of $K_{1c}$:

$(45 \text{ MPa}\sqrt{\text{m}})^2 = 202500 \text{ MPa}^2 \text{m}^2$

Explanation:

The peak aging time for an Al-4 wt.% Cu alloy is indeed indicated by a maximum in the hardness. This is because during the aging process, the precipitation of CuAl2 precipitates from the solid solution strengthens the alloy, leading to an increase in hardness. The hardness reaches a maximum when the precipitates have grown to an optimal size, which is the peak aging time.

However, the maximum volume fraction of the θ precipitates is not the only reason for the maximum hardness at the peak aging time.

Given: ε = 0.3, σ = $200𝜀^(ε)^{0.25}$

First, let's find ε^(0.25):

ε^(0.25) = ε^(0.25 - 1) * ε^1
          = ε^(-0.75) * ε^1
          = ε^(-0.75 + 1) / ε^1
          = ε^0.25 / ε

Since ε = 0.3, we have:

ε^0.25 / ε = ε^0.25 / 0.3

Now, let's find ε^0.25:

ε^0.25 = (ε^0.25 / ε) * ε
       = (ε^0.25 / 0.3) * 0.3
       = ε^0.25

Now, we can find the true stress (σ):

σ = $200𝜀(ε^0.25)$

Next, we'll find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W) using the true stress and true strain:

W = ∫σdε

Since the deformation is ideal plastic, the area under the stress-strain curve is equal to the product of the yield strength (S0) and the plastic strain range (εp):

W = S0 * εp

However, we don't have the yield strength (S0) in this problem, but we do have the true stress (σ) and the true strain (ε). We can relate them using the flow curve equation:

σ = $200𝜀(ε)^(0.25)$

Squaring both sides:

σ^2 = $40000𝜀^2(ε)^(0.5)

Now, we can find the plastic strain range (εp) using the given true strain (ε):

εp = ε - ε_elastic

Since the problem states that the deformation is ideal plastic, there is no elastic deformation, so ε_elastic = 0. Therefore, εp = ε.

Now, we can find the yield strength (S0) using the true stress (σ) and the plastic strain range (εp):

S0 = σ / (1 + εp)

Substituting the values we have:

S0 = $200𝜀(ε)^(0.25)$ / (1 + ε)

Now, we can find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W):

W = S0 * εp

Δh = (Δd / (1 + (d / D)²)) * h

where:
- Δh is the maximum possible reduction,
- Δd is the roll diameter,
- d is the plate thickness before rolling,
- D is the roll diameter,
- h is the plate thickness after rolling.

First, we need to find the value of h:

h = d - Δh

We want to find the maximum possible reduction, so we'll set Δh equal to d:

Δh = d

Now we can substitute the values of d and D into the Ekelund's expression:

Δh = (Δd / (1 + (d / D)²)) * d

We know that Δd = 200 mm and d = 250 mm:

Δh = (200 mm / (1 + (250 mm / 200 mm)²)) * 250 mm

Calculating the value of the denominator:

1 + (250 mm / 200 mm)² = 1 + (1.25)² = ≈ ≈ 1.5625

Now we can calculate the maximum possible reduction:

Δh = (200 mm / 1.5625) * 250 mm ≈ 347.2 mm

Since the reduction must be in mm, the answer is approximately 347.2 mm.

The fracture stress (in MPa) is?","To calculate the fracture stress for the given glass plate, we need to use the Griffith's criterion for brittle fracture, which states that the energy released during the fracture process is equal to the energy required to create new surfaces.

First, we need to calculate the energy required to create new surfaces for both cracks.

For the internal crack:
Surface energy per unit area = 1 J.m^(-2)
Crack length = 5 μm = 5 × 10^-6 m
Energy required for internal crack = 2 × √(2) × Surface energy per unit area × Crack length^2

For the surface crack:
Surface energy per unit area = 1 J.m^(-2)
Crack length = 3 μm = 3 × 10^-6 m
Energy required for surface crack = 2 × √(2) × Surface energy per unit area × Crack length^2

Now, we can calculate the total energy required for both cracks:

Total energy required = Energy required for internal crack + Energy required for surface crack

Next, we need to calculate the energy released during the fracture process. We can use the Legrangé's formula for the energy release rate, which states that the energy release rate is equal to the product of the Young's modulus, the applied stress, and the crack length.

Energy release rate = Young's modulus × Applied stress × Crack length

Finally, we can use the Griffith's criterion to calculate the fracture stress:

Fracture stress = (Total energy required / (2 × √(2) × Young's modulus × Crack length))^(1/2)

Substituting the given values:

Young's modulus = 70 GPa = 70 × 10^9 Pa
Surface energy per unit area = 1 J.m^(-2) = 1 × 10^-2 J.m^(-2)
Internal crack length = 5 μm = 5 × 10^-6 m
Surface crack length = 3 μm = 3 × 10^-6 m

Total energy required = (2 × √(2) × 1 × 10^-2 J.m^(-2) × (5 × 10^-6 m)^2) + (2 × √(2) × 1 × 10^-2 J.m^(-2) × (3 × 10^-6 m)^2) = 1.125 × 10^-6 J

Fracture stress = (1.125 × 10^-6 J / (2 × √(2) × 70 × 10^9 Pa × 5 × 10^-6 m))^(1/2) = 1.18 MPa

From the context, we know that the Schmid factor for the (111) slip system in an FCC metal crystal is as = 1.3.

Using the empirical relation given by v = (r/r0Y', where r0 is the stress for unit speed and n is an index which varies for different materials, we can find the stress for unit speed (r0) for the given FCC crystal.

The index n for intrinsically soft fcc crystals is high (~200).

Therefore, we can write:

r0 = v / (n * Y')

where v is the velocity, Y' is the Young's modulus, and n is the index.

From the context, we know that the velocity (v) is not given, but we can assume a typical value for comparison. Let's assume v = 1 m/s.

We also know that the Young's modulus (Y') for an FCC metal crystal is typically around 100 GPa.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

r0 = 1 / (200 * 100e9 * 1e-9) = 4.79e-6 Pa

Now, we can find the tensile stress (σ) required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane using the critical resolved shear stress (τc) and the Schmid factor (pf/Pp):

σ = τc / (pf/Pp)

where τc is the critical resolved shear stress, pf is the force component parallel to the slip plane, Pp is the total applied pressure, and Pp = σ / sin²θ, where θ is the angle between the applied stress and the normal to the slip plane.

Since the applied stress is along the [100] direction and the (111) slip plane has a normal vector of [111], the angle between the applied stress and the normal to the slip plane is 45 degrees.

Therefore, sin²θ = 0.5 (for a right triangle).

Substituting the values, we get:

σ = 6e6 Pa / (1.3 * sin²45) = 11.5 GPa

Therefore, the tensile stress required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane is approximately 11.5 GPa.

First, we take the logarithm of both sides of the equation:

$\log \sigma = \log 50 + 0.3*\log \epsilon$

Now, we substitute the given yield stress value and solve for $\log \epsilon$:

What is the value of the resolved shear stress on the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system in MPa rounded off to two decimal places?,"To find the resolved shear stress on the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system, we need to use Schmid's law. Schmid's law states that the shear stress acting on a crystal plane is equal to the applied stress multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the applied stress and the normal to the crystal plane.

First, we need to find the normal to the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system. The normal to a crystal plane can be found by taking the cross product of two vectors that lie in the plane. In this case, the two vectors are the [1 1 -1] and [1 0 1] vectors.

The cross product of [1 1 -1] and [1 0 1] is:

[i j k] x [1 1 -1] [1 0 1] = [1 -1 0]

So the normal to the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system is [1 -1 0].

Next, we need to find the angle between the applied stress and the normal to the slip system. The [321] direction can be represented as [1 1 2] / sqrt(3).

The angle between [321] and (1 1 -1) [101] can be found using the dot product:

[1 1 2] . [1 -1 0] = 1 * 1 + 1 * (-1) + 2 * 0 = 0

Since the dot product is zero, the angle between the two directions is 90 degrees.

resolved shear stress = applied stress * cos(angle between applied stress and slip system normal)

resolved shear stress = 10 MPa * cos(90 degrees) = 0 MPa

Work done per unit area = Force applied per unit area × Distance traveled by the plate per unit area

Since the plate's width remains constant, the force applied per unit area can be calculated using the entry velocity and the flow stress of the material. The distance traveled by the plate per unit area is equal to the change in thickness.

Flow stress of the material = 80 MPa (given)
Entry velocity = 10 $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$
Change in thickness = 5 $𝑐𝑚 - 3 $𝑐𝑚 = 2 $𝑐𝑚

Force applied per unit area = Flow stress × Entry velocity
Force applied per unit area = 80 MPa × 10 $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$ = 800 N/m²

Work done per unit area = Force applied per unit area × Change in thickness
Work done per unit area = 800 N/m² × 2 $𝑐𝑚$ = 1600 J/m²

Now, we can use the conservation of energy principle to find the exit velocity:

Total energy before rolling = Energy after rolling + Work done

Total energy before rolling = (1/2) × Density × Entry velocity² × Area

Density of the plate = 7850 kg/m³ (assumed for aluminum)
Area = 100 $𝑐$ × 5 $𝑐$ = 500 $𝑐^2$

Total energy before rolling = (1/2) × 7850 kg/m³ × 10 $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$² × 500 $𝑐^2$

Total energy before rolling = 3.93 × 10⁵ J

Energy after rolling = (1/2) × Density × Exit velocity² × Area

We need to find the exit velocity that satisfies the equation:

3.93 × 10⁵ J = (1/2) × 7850 kg/m³ × Exit velocity² × 500 $𝑐^2$

Solving for Exit velocity:

Exit velocity = √((2 × 3.93 × 10⁵ J) / (0.5 × 7850 kg/m³ × 500 $𝑐^2$))
Exit velocity = 12.1 $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$

So, the exit velocity of the plate is approximately 12.1 $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$.",,,0,

The maximum possible reduction (in 𝑚𝑚, rounded off to one decimal place) of a 100 mm thick slab during rolling is","To find the maximum possible reduction during rolling, we can use the following simplified hot-rolling formula:

Δh = (2Aμ)/(πD)

A = contact area between roll and slab (mm²)

d = thickness of slab before rolling (mm)

A = π(100^2)/4 = 78539.82 mm²

Now, we can find the maximum reduction:

Δh = (2 * 78539.82 * 0.2)/(π * 200) = 35.31 mm

We are given that the fracture toughness $K_(1c)$ = 30 MPa$m^(1/2)$ and the crack geometry factor is unity.

First, we need to find the critical crack length $a\_c$ that can be detected by NDT. Since the NDT technique can only detect cracks larger than 1mm, we have:

$$a\_c = 1 \ mm = 1 \times 10^{-3} \ m$$

$$K\_I = K_(1c) \sqrt{\pi a\_c} = 30 \ MPa \sqrt{\pi (1 \times 10^{-3} \ m)}$$

$$\sigma\_a = \frac{K\_I}{Y \sqrt{\pi a\_c}} = \frac{30 \ MPa \sqrt{\pi (1 \times 10^{-3} \ m)}}{1 \times 10^{-3} \ m} = 30 \ MPa \sqrt{\pi} \approx 34.1 \ MPa$$

Mechanical,88,G-META-20-51,NUM,50,The steady state creep rate of a material increasees by a factor of 20 when the temperature is increased from 890K to 980K. The creep rate at a temperature of x K (round off to the nearest integer) will be 5 times the creep rate at 890 K. Find x. ," To find the value of x, we can use the given information about the creep rate increasing by a factor of 20 when the temperature is increased from 890K to 980K, and that the creep rate at x K is 5 times the creep rate at 890 K.

Let the creep rate at 890 K be C. Then, the creep rate at 980 K is 20C.

We want to find the creep rate at x K, which is 5 times the creep rate at 890 K. So, the creep rate at x K is 5C.

We can set up the equation:

5C = x-dependent creep rate

Since the creep rate is a function of temperature, we can write:

Ci = Ci0e^(Q/RT)

where Ci is the creep rate at temperature T, Ci0 is the creep rate at a reference temperature, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

We can set up the equation for the creep rate at x K:

Cx = C0e^(Q/RTx)

Since Cx = 5C and Ci0 = C, we have:

5C = C0e^(Q/RTx)

We can solve for x by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(5) + ln(C0/C) = ln(e^(Q/RTx))

ln(5) + ln(C0/C) = Q/RTx

We can simplify by bringing the constants to one side:

ln(5C/C) = Q/R(1/Tx)

We can rearrange to solve for x:

x = (Q/Rln(5C/C))^-1

Since Q = 460 kJ/mol, R = 8.314 J/mol-K, and C = 1.2 × 10^-6 m/s, we have:

x = (460,000 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol-K × ln(5 × 1.2 × 10^-6 m/s / 1.2 × 10^-6 m/s)))^-1

x ≈ 1011 K

The crack growth rate is related to the stress intensity range, ΔK as da/dN ∝ $(ΔK)^(3)$, where, a is the crack lenght and N is the number of cycles. When the crack length increases by a factor of two, the crack growth rate will increase by a factor of?(round off to one decimal place). "," To find the factor by which the crack growth rate increases when the crack length increases by a factor of two, we need to use the given relationship between crack growth rate and stress intensity range: da/dN ∝ $(ΔK)^(3)$.

Let the initial crack length be a₀ and the final crack length be 2a₀. The corresponding stress intensity ranges will be ΔK₀ and ΔK₁, respectively. We can assume that the mean stress remains zero.

From the given relationship, we have:

da₀/dN ∝ $(ΔK₀)^(3)$
da₁/dN ∝ $(ΔK₁)^(3)$

Since the mean stress is zero, the stress intensity ranges are proportional to the stress ranges:

ΔK₀ = Yσ₀ √πa₀
ΔK₁ = Yσ₁ √πa₁

where Y is the stress intensity factor calibration constant and σ is the stress range.

Since the crack length has increased by a factor of two, we have a₁ = 2a₀. Substituting this into the equation for ΔK₁, we get:

ΔK₁ = Yσ₁ √π(2a₀)

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the factor by which the crack growth rate increases:

(da₀/dN) / (da₁/dN) = $(ΔK₀)^(3)$ / $(ΔK₁)^(3)$

Substituting the expressions for ΔK₀ and ΔK₁, we get:

(da₀/dN) / (da₁/dN) = $(Yσ₀ √πa₀)^(3)$ / $(Yσ₁ √π(2a₀))^(3)$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

(da₀/dN) / (da₁/dN) = $(Yσ₀ / Yσ₁)^3$

Since the stress range σ₁ is twice the stress range σ₀, we have σ₁ = 2σ₀. Substituting this into the above expression, we get:

(da₀/dN) / (da₁/dN) = $(Yσ₀ / Yσ₁)^3$ = $(Yσ₀ / 2Yσ₀)^3$ = 2^(3) = 8

1. Flow stress (cr) = 50 MPa, Strain rate (~) = 0.1 $s^(-1)$
2. Flow stress (cr) = 70 MPa, Strain rate (~) = 10 $s^(-1)$

First, we need to find the constant C. We can use the first data point:

50 MPa = C(0.1 $s^(-1)$)^m

Now, we can solve for m:

ln(50 MPa) = ln(C) + m * ln(0.1 $s^(-1)$)

m = [ln(50 MPa) - ln(C)] / ln(0.1 $s^(-1)$)

70 MPa = C(10 $s^(-1)$)^m
C = 70 MPa / (10 $s^(-1)$)^m

Using the first data point to find m, we get:

","To find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume, we first need to calculate the strain rate, ε, and then integrate it over the deformation process.

Given:
Initial diameter (D1) = 30 mm = 0.03 m
Final diameter (D2) = 20 mm = 0.02 m
Flow behavior equation: σ = 350 ε^(0.3) MPa

First, let's find the strain rate, ε:

ε = (σ / 350)^(1/0.3)

We need to find the yield stress at both the initial and final diameters.

At the initial diameter:
σ1 = 350 ε^(0.3)
σ1 = 350 (ε1)^(0.3)

At the final diameter:
σ2 = 350 ε^(0.3)
σ2 = 350 (ε2)^(0.3)

Since the alloy is cold extruded, we assume that the yield stress decreases during the deformation process. Let's assume a reduction in yield stress of 10%.

Reduction in yield stress = 10%

So, the yield stress at the final diameter is:

σ2 = 0.9 * σ1

Now, let's find the strain rates at both diameters:

ε1 = (σ1 / 350)^(1/0.3)
ε1 = (350 (ε1)^(0.3) / 350)^(1/0.3)
ε1 = ε1^(1/3)

Solving for ε1:

ε1 = 1

Now, let's find the strain rate at the final diameter:

ε2 = (σ2 / 350)^(1/0.3)
ε2 = (0.9 * σ1 / 350)^(1/0.3)
ε2 = (0.9)^(1/3) * ε1

Solving for ε2:

ε2 = 0.8185 * ε1

The volume of the cylindrical specimen remains constant during the deformation process. So, the volume before deformation is equal to the volume after deformation.

Volume before deformation = π/4 * D1^2 * H
Volume after deformation = π/4 * D2^2 * H

Since the volumes are equal:

D1^2 = D2^2

Now, let's find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume:

W = ∫σ dV

Since the alloy behaves ideally plastically, the work done per unit volume is equal to the area under the stress-strain curve from the initial yield stress to the final yield stress.

W = ∫350 ε^(0.3) dV

Since the volume remains constant:

dV = d(π/4 * D^2 * H) = π/2 * D * dD

Substituting this into the strain rate expression:

W = ∫350 (π/2 * D * dD / 350)^(1/0.3) dD

Solving this integral is not straightforward, but we can approximate it by dividing the process into small steps and summing up the work done in each step.

Let's divide the process into 100 steps, each with a small reduction in diameter.

Step i:
Diameter = D1 - i * (D1 - D2) / 100
Strain rate = (σ / 350)^(1/0.3)
Work done in this step = 350 (π/2 * D * dD / 350)^(1/0.3)

Summing up the work done in all steps:

W ≈ ∑350 (π/2 * D * dD / 350)^(1/0.3)

Approximating the sum as an integral:

W ≈ ∫350 (π/2 * D * dD / 350)^(1/0.3) dD

Material manufacturing,6,G-XEC-2020-10,MCQS,70,Read the two statements related to sintering and select the correct option. Statement-1: Sintering in vacuum leads to improved densification as compared to sintering under ambient (at atmospheric pressure) condition. Statement-2: Closed pores formed during sintering inhibit full densification.   (A)	Both Statement-1 and Statement-2 are FALSE. (B)	Both statement-1 and Statement-2 are TRUE.  (C)	Statement-1 is TRUE but Statement -2 is FALSE.  (D)	Statement-1 is FALSE but Statement-2 is TRUE. ,"Based on the context provided, the correct answer is (C) Statement-1 is TRUE but Statement-2 is FALSE.

Explanation:

Statement-1 is true because vacuum sintering allows for the elimination of oxidation reactions and gas evolution, which can hinder the densification process. This results in improved densification compared to sintering under ambient conditions.

Statement-2 is false because closed pores formed during sintering do not necessarily inhibit full densification. In fact, they can contribute to the densification process by promoting particle-particle contact and the formation of necks between particles. However, if the pores are too large or interconnected, they can hinder densification. The context does not provide enough information to determine if the closed pores in question are beneficial or detrimental to densification.",,,0,

Let P(n) denote the probability that there will be no accident over a period of ‘n’ months. Assume that the events of individual months are independent of each other. The smallest integer value of ‘n’ such that P(n) ≤ ½ is? (round off to the nearest integer) "," To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ 1/2, we need to calculate the probability of no accidents in 'n' months given that the probability of an accident in one month is 1/100.

We can use the formula for the probability of the complementary event, which is:

P(no accidents in n months) = (1 - probability of an accident in one month) ^ n

Substituting the given value, we have:

P(no accidents in n months) = (1 - 1/100) ^ n

To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ 1/2, we need to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that:

(1 - 1/100) ^ n ≤ 1/2

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we have:

n log2(0.99) ≤ log2(0.5)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(0.99) ≈ -0.00585 and log2(0.5) = 1.

Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that:

n ≥ 1 + log2(0.5) / log2(0.99)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(0.5) / log2(0.99) ≈ 3.3219.

Material manufacturing,9,G-XEC-2021-21,NUM,52,"A certain ceramic has a theoretical density and sintered density of 6.76 $gcm^(−3)$ and 6.60 g $cm^(−3)$ , respectively. The green compact has 18 volume percent porosity. For a sintered cube of side 2 cm, the required side of the cubic green compact in cm is? (round off to 2 decimal places) ","To find the required side of the cubic green compact, we first need to determine the density of the green compact. Since the green compact has a porosity of 18%, its actual density is lower than its theoretical density.

Theoretical density of the ceramic = 6.76 g/cm³
Sintered density of the ceramic = 6.60 g/cm³
Porosity = 18% = 0.18

To find the actual density of the green compact, we can use the following equation:

Actual density = Theoretical density × (1 - Porosity)

Actual density = 6.76 g/cm³ × (1 - 0.18)
Actual density = 5.81 g/cm³

Now, we can find the required side of the cubic green compact by using the following equation:

Required side = (Target volume / Actual volume) ^ (1/3)

Target volume = mass of sintered cube
Target volume = 6.60 g/cm³ × (2 cm)³ = 26.656 cm³

Actual volume = mass of green compact / Actual density

Mass of green compact = Target volume × Actual density
Mass of green compact = 26.656 cm³ × 5.81 g/cm³ = 152.35 g

Therefore,

Required side = (152.35 g / 5.81 g/cm³) ^ (1/3)
Required side = 3.11 cm

So, the required side of the cubic green compact is approximately 3.11 cm (rounded off to 2 decimal places).",,,0,

Explanation:

The hot metal at 1700 K pours into a sand mould that is open at the top. Heat loss from the liquid metal occurs through various mechanisms:

1. Radiation: Heat is emitted as electromagnetic waves and travels through the space without requiring a medium.
2. Conduction: Heat is transferred through direct contact between two solid materials or between a solid and a fluid in contact.
3. Convection: Heat is transferred by the movement of a fluid (in this case, air) over the surface of the liquid metal.

Since the mould is open at the top, there is no insulation to prevent convective heat loss. Additionally, the hot metal will radiate heat to its surroundings. Therefore, all three mechanisms (radiation, conduction, and convection) contribute to the heat loss from the liquid metal.",,,0,

Let $m\_i$ be the mass of each component in the slag, and $M\_i$ be its molecular weight. Then, the mole number $n\_i$ of each component is given by:

$$n\_i = \frac{m\_i}{M\_i}$$

The total mass of the slag is given by:

$$m\_{total} = m\_(CaO) + m\_(MgO) + m\ m\_(Al\_2O\_3) + m\_(SiO\_2)$$

Using the given weight percentages, we have:

$$m\_(CaO) = 0.55 \times m\_{total}$$
$$m\_(MgO) = 0.10 \times m\_{total}$$
$$m\_(Al\_2O\_3) = 0.15 \times m\_{total}$$
$$m\_(SiO\_2) = 0.20 \times m\_{total}$$$$

We can now find the mole fractions:

$$X\_(CaO) = \frac{n\_(CaO)}{n\_{total}} = \frac{m\_(CaO)/M\_(CaO)}{m\_{total}/M\_{total}} = \frac{0.55}{0.55 + 0.10 + 0.15 + 0.20} \times \frac{40}{100.12}$$

Similarly, we have:

$$X\_(MgO) = \frac{0.10}{0.55 + 0.10 + 0.15 + 0.20} \times \frac{24}{100.12}$$
$$X\_(Al\_2O\_3) = \frac{0.15}{0.55 + 0.10 + 0.15 + 0.20} \times \frac{2\times 27}{100.12}$$
$$X\_(SiO\_2) = \frac{0.20}{0.55 + 0.10 + 0.15 + 0.20} \times \frac{2\times 28}{100.12}$$

Substituting these values into the given equation, we get:

The context does not directly provide information on the severity of quenching for each method mentioned. However, it is mentioned that water quenching with agitation (R) is more effective in preventing the formation of undesirable phases compared to water quenching without agitation (Q). Brine quenching (S) is also mentioned to be more effective than water quenching in certain cases. Therefore, based on the available information, we can infer that:

1. Water quenching (Q) is less severe than oil quenching (P) since oil quenching is known to be a slower cooling process.

Iron ore contains 95% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$, so the mass percentage of iron is 0.95 * 100% / 100% = 0.95.
The atomic weight of iron is 56 g $mol^(-1)$, and the molecular weight of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ is 160 g $mol^(-1)$.

Mass of iron in 1 kg of iron ore = (mass of iron in 1 kg of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$) * (percentage of iron)
= (1 kg) * (0.95) / (100%) * (160 g $mol^(-1)$) / (since the mass of 1 mol of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ is 160 g)
= 89.29 kg

2. Calculate the mass of gangue in 1 kg of iron ore:
Mass of gangue in 1 kg of iron ore = 1 kg - Mass of iron in 1 kg of iron ore
= 1 kg - 89.29 kg
= 10.71 kg

3. Calculate the amount of iron ore required to produce 1000 kg of hot metal:
The hot metal contains 95% Fe, so the mass percentage of iron in the hot metal is 0.95 * 100% / 100% = 0.95.

Mass of iron in 1000 kg of hot metal = 1000 kg * 0.95
= 950 kg

Mass of iron ore required = Mass of iron in 1000 kg of hot metal / Mass of iron in 1 kg of iron ore
= 950 kg / 89.29 kg $per$per$kg
≈ 10.63 $tone$s

Since we cannot have a fraction of a tonne, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, approximately 11 tonnes of iron ore are required to produce 1000 kg of hot metal.

Since FeO is the oxidized form of Fe, we can find the weight percent of FeO by subtracting the weight percent of metallic Fe from the total weight percent of Fe.

Weight percent of FeO = Total Fe - Metallic Fe

If mould length ($L_m$) is 0.8 m and casting speed ($U_c$) is 0.2 $m.s^(-1)$, the average mould flux (in MW.$m^(-2)$) is?","To find the average mould flux, we first need to find the value of $q\_m$ at the meniscus ($z=0$) and at the bottom of the mould ($z=L\_m$). Then we can calculate the average flux by integrating the mould flux over the length of the mould and dividing by the mould area.

First, let's find $q\_m$ at $z=0$ and $z=L\_m$:

At $z=0$:
$$q\_m(0) = [2.67 - 0.33(0/U\_c)^{0.5}] * 10^6 = 2.67 * 10^6 \text{ W/m}^2$$

At $z=L\_m$:
$$q\_m(L\_m) = [2.67 - 0.33((L\_m/U\_c)^{0.5})] * 10^6$$

Now, let's calculate the average mould flux:

The mould area is given by $A\_m = L\_m * b$, where $b$ is the width of the mould.

$$A\_m = 0.8 \text{ m} * \text{unknown width}$$

To find the average mould flux, we need to integrate $q\_m(z)$ over the length of the mould and divide by the mould area:

$$\bar{q\_m} = \frac{1}{A\_m} \int\_{0}^{L\_m} q\_m(z) dz$$

Substituting the given expression for $q\_m(z)$ and integrating:

$$\bar{q\_m} = \frac{1}{0.8 \text{ m} * \text{unknown width}} \int\_{0}^{0.8 \text{ m}} [2.67 - 0.33((z/0.2 \text{ m/s})^{0.5})] * 10^6 \text{ d}z$$

The exact calculation of the integral requires numerical methods. However, we can approximate the average mould flux by finding the average of $q\_m(0)$ and $q\_m(L\_m)$:

$$\bar{q\_m} \approx \frac{q\_m(0) + q\_m(L\_m)}{2}$$

$$\bar{q\_m} \approx \frac{2.67 * 10^6 \text{ W/m}^2 + [2.67 - 0.33((0.8 \text{ m}/0.2 \text{ m/s})^{0.5})] * 10^6 \text{ W/m}^2}{2}$$

$$\bar{q\_m} \approx 3.005 * 10^6 \text{ W/m}^2$$

To convert this value to MW.$m^(-2)$, we need to divide by 1,000,000:

The slag produced during refining contains 40 wt.% CaO and 22 wt.% FeO. Neglecting material losses, the yield of Fe (in %) is?"," To find the yield of Fe in BOF steelmaking, we first need to determine the mass of CaO and FeO in the slag. Then, we can calculate the mass of Fe in the hot metal and the mass of CaO and FeO in the lime used. Finally, we can find the yield of Fe by dividing the mass of Fe in the hot metal by the total mass of the hot metal and the lime.

First, let's find the mass of CaO and FeO in the slag:

Mass of CaO in slag = 40 wt.% * 100 metric ton * 0.90 (wt.%)
Mass of CaO in slag = 36 ton

Mass of FeO in slag = 22 wt.% * 100 metric ton * 0.932 (wt.%)
Mass of FeO in slag = 20.184 ton

Next, let's find the mass of CaO and FeO in the lime used:

Mass of CaO in lime = 5 metric ton * 90 wt.% * 1000 kg/metric ton * 0.90 (wt.%)
Mass of CaO in lime = 45450 kg

Since 1 mole of CaO produces 1 mole of FeO during the refining process, we can find the mass of FeO in the lime as follows:

Mass of FeO in lime = Mass of CaO in lime / 2
Mass of FeO in lime = 22725 kg

Now, let's find the mass of Fe in the hot metal:

Mass of Fe in hot metal = 100 metric ton * 0.932 (wt.%) * 1000 kg/metric ton
Mass of Fe in hot metal = 93200 kg

Finally, we can find the yield of Fe:

Yield of Fe = (Mass of Fe in hot metal) / (Mass of Fe in hot metal + Mass of CaO in lime + Mass of FeO in lime)
Yield of Fe = 93200 kg / (93200 kg + 45450 kg + 22725 kg)
Yield of Fe = 0.78 or 78%

So, the yield of Fe in BOF steelmaking is 78%.",,,0,
Material manufacturing,44,G-META-17-37,NUM,78,"In primary steelmaking, dissolved oxygen(O) reacts with carbon (C) to produce CO(g), at 1atm pressure according to the reaction: C + O = CO(g). The equilibrium constant for this reaction is: logK = (1160/T) + 2.003, where T is in Kelvin. Assuming Henrian activity coefficient of both O and C to be unity, the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of a plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600° C is?(answer up tp four decimal places)","To find the dissolved oxygen content in wt.% at 1600°C, we first need to calculate the equilibrium constant value using the given equation:

logK = (1160/T) + 2.003

Convert temperature to Kelvin:
T = 1600°C + 273.15 = 1863.15 K

Now, calculate the equilibrium constant value:
logK = (1160/1863.15) + 2.003
logK ≈ 0.5115

Since the activities of O and C are assumed to be unity, the equilibrium constant value is equal to the reaction quotient (Q):

Q = [CO]/[C][O]

Since the partial pressures of CO and O are directly related to their activities at 1 atm, we can use the ideal gas law to find their concentrations in terms of partial pressures:

[CO] = P_CO/RT
[O] = P_O/RT

Since the total pressure is 1 atm, we have:

P_CO + P_O = 1 atm

We need to find the equilibrium partial pressures of CO and O to calculate their concentrations. We can use the given equation:

logK = log(P_CO/P_O) + logP_O

Since logP_O = log(1 atm) = 0, we have:

logK = log(P_CO) + log(1)
logK = log(P_CO)

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant value to find the equilibrium partial pressure of CO:

log(P_CO) = logK
P_CO = 10^logK

Substitute the value of logK:

P_CO = 10^0.5115
P_CO ≈ 0.301 atm

Since the total pressure is 1 atm, we can find the equilibrium partial pressure of O:

P_O = 1 atm - P_CO
P_O = 0.699 atm

Now, we can calculate the concentrations of CO and O:

[CO] = P_CO/RT
[CO] = 0.301 atm / (8.314 J/mol.K * 1863.15 K)
[CO] ≈ 0.00011 mol/L

[O] = P_O/RT
[O] = 0.699 atm / (8.314 J/mol.K * 1863.15 K)
[O] ≈ 0.00023 mol/L

Since the weight percent of a component is equal to the number of moles of that component divided by the total number of moles, we can calculate the dissolved oxygen content:

wt.% O = (moles of O) / (total moles) * 1000%

Total moles = (moles of C) + (moles of O)
Total moles = (0.007 mol) + (moles of O)

moles of O = [O] * (total volume)
moles of O = 0.00023 mol/L * (total volume)

Substitute the value of total volume:

moles of O = 0.00023 mol/L * (mass of steel / (density of steel * 1000))

The density of steel = 7850 kg/m³

moles of O = 0.00023 mol/L * (mass of steel / (7850 kg/m³ * 1000))

Now, calculate the dissolved oxygen content:

wt.% O = (moles of O) / (total moles) * 100%
wt.% O ≈ (0.00023 mol/L * (mass of steel / (7850 kg/m³ * 1000))) / ((0.007 mol) + (0.00023 mol/L * (mass of steel / (7850 kg/m³ * 1000)))) * 100%

BF (Blast Furnace) → BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) → LF (Ladle Furnace Process) → RH (Ruhrstahl Heraeus Degassing Process)

Explanation:

1. Blast Furnace (BF): In the blast furnace, iron ore, coal, and limestone are charged, and hot air is supplied from below via tuyeres. The hot air and carbon react to generate the heat needed for the reduction reaction and melt formation. The iron and steel are produced through a pyrometallurgical process.
2. Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF): The molten iron from the blast furnace is transferred to the basic oxygen furnace, where pure oxygen gas is injected through a lance to remove impurities as gases. The slag is formed on the top, and the clean molten iron is obtained.
3. Ladle Furnace Process (LF): The molten iron from the basic oxygen furnace is transferred to a ladle and then to a ladle furnace, where it is further refined by adding alloying elements and deoxidizers. The molten steel is then tapped out of the furnace.
4. Ruhrstahl Heraeus Degassing Process (RH): The molten steel from the ladle furnace is transferred to the degassing furnace, where it is degassed by blowing inert gases (nitrogen or argon) to remove dissolved gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen) to improve the steel's mechanical properties.",,,0,
Material manufacturing,47,G-META-18-6,MCQS-NUM,67,"During decarburization in a steel bath at 1550 °C, the compositions of dissolved C (wt.%C) and dissolved O (wt.%O) follow the relation: (wt.%C)(wt.%O) = K. When the partial pressure of CO ($𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$) is 1 atm, K = 0.002. If $𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$ = 0.1 atm, what is the value of K, at the same temperature? Note: Assume Henry’s law is applicable.  (A) 0.06 (B) 0.002 (C) 0.02 (D) 0.0002","To find the value of K when the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm, we need to use Henry's law, which relates the partial pressure of a gas to the concentration of that gas in a liquid. In this case, we're given that the relationship between the weight percentages of carbon and oxygen in the steel bath follows the equation (wt.%C)(wt.%O) = K.

First, let's assume that the total weight percentage of carbon and oxygen in the steel bath is 100%. Then, we can write the equation as:

wt.%C + wt.%O = 1

Now, we can use Henry's law to relate the partial pressure of CO to the weight percentage of carbon in the steel bath:

$p_{CO} = H * wt.%C$

where H is Henry's constant.

Since we're given that the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm when K = 0.002, we can write:

$0.1 \text{ atm} = H * 0.002$

Solving for H, we get:

$H = 50 \text{ atm-percent}$

Now, we can use this value of H to find the weight percentage of carbon when the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm:

$wt.%C = \frac{p_{CO}}{H} = \frac{0.1 \text{ atm}}{50 \text{ atm-percent}} = 0.002$

Using the given relationship, we can find the weight percentage of oxygen:

$wt.%O = 1 - wt.%C = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$

So, the value of K when the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm is:

$K = (wt.%C)(wt.%O) = (0.002)(0.998) = 0.001996$

Therefore, the answer is (C) 0.001996 or approximately 0.002, which is not an option given in the question. However, the closest option is (C) 0.002. So, the answer is (C) based on the given information and assumptions. assumptions.",,,0,

Based on the context provided, there is no explicit mention of which element or compound is added to the slag to minimize refractory loss. However, we can make some inferences based on the information given.

The context mentions that alloying elements such as Mn, Si, P, Ni, and Cr are added to low carbon steels up to a total of around 5 wt %. It also mentions that extensive research has identified the formation of major iron oxides such as α-FeOOH, γ-FeOOH, β-FeOOH, and Fe3O4. These iron oxides are likely to be present in the slag during steel-making.

Refractory materials are used to line the walls and bottom of the blast furnace to protect it from the high temperatures and corrosive environment. The loss of refractory materials during steel-making can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs.

One way to minimize refractory loss is by adding materials selection and design, such as using refractory materials with high melting points and low thermal expansion coefficients. Another way is to add materials to the slag that can react with the refractory materials and form a protective layer on their surface.

Based on the context, it appears that MgO is added to the slag to improve the wear resistance of A1 alloys. However, it is not explicitly stated that MgO is added to the slag to minimize refractory loss during BOF steel-making.

Therefore, based on the information given in the context, it is not possible to minimize refractory loss during BOF steel-making, but it is not explicitly stated which element or compound is added to the slag for this purpose.

(A) The lower atomic weight element is leached (B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached (C) The more electronegative element is leached (D) The element with lower density is leached,"The statement regarding selective leaching of a binary alloy that is TRUE is (C) The more electronegative element is leached.

Explanation:
Selective leaching is a process used to extract specific elements from a binary alloy. The more electronegative element is more likely to be leached due to its greater tendency to form ions in the presence of an oxidizing agent or acid. This is because electronegative elements have a stronger attraction to electrons, making it easier for them to lose electrons and form ions. The other options (A, B, and D) are not necessarily true for all cases of selective leaching.",,,0,

A blast furnace uses hematite ore with 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. It uses 600 kg coke per ton of hot metal. The coke contains 85% C and 15%ash. The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5%C. The weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal respectively, are: (Assume that the gangue materials of the ore and ash content of coke form slag while $Fe_(2)O_3$ in the ore is consumed in making hot metal)  (A) 1705 kg, 431 kg (B) 2131kg, 546 kg (C) 1705kg, 331kg (D) 1500kg, 431kg"," To find the weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal, we need to first calculate the weight of iron in the hot metal and the weight of iron in the iron ore.

1. Weight of iron in hot metal:
The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5% C. Therefore, the weight of iron in 1 ton of hot metal is:

1000 kg * 0.955 = 955 kg

2. Weight of iron in iron ore:
The iron ore contains 80% Fe2O3 and 20% gangue materials. Since Fe2O3 contains 73.3% Fe (molar percentage), the weight of Fe in 1 ton of iron ore is:

1000 kg * 0.8 * 0.733 = 528.6 kg

3. Weight of iron ore used:
Since the coke reacts with Fe2O3 in the iron ore to produce hot metal and slag, the weight of iron ore used is equal to the weight of Fe in the iron ore plus the weight of coke used.

528.6 kg (Fe in iron ore) + 600 kg (coke) = 1128.6 kg

4. Weight of slag produced:
The gangue materials in the iron ore and the ash content of coke combine to form slag. The weight of slag produced is equal to the weight of the non-metallic components in the iron ore and coke.

The weight of gangue materials in 1 ton of iron ore is 20% * 1000 kg = 200 kg.
The weight of ash in 600 kg of coke is 15% * 600 kg = 90 kg.

Therefore, the weight of non-metallic components is 200 kg (gangue) + 90 kg (ash) = 290 kg.

The weight of slag produced is equal to the weight of non-metallic components in the iron ore and coke, which is 290 kg.

So, the weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal are:

1128.6 kg (iron ore) and 290 kg (slag)

The mass of the casting is given as Choke Area × Density × L × Time. Solving for the choke area, we get:

Choke Area = (2-10) [Metal] [Pouring Rate] [Sprue Efficiency] / [Density] [L] [Time]

Given:
Metaluminum density = 2700 kg/m³
Pouring rate = 4 m³/s
Sprue efficiency = 0.95

First, we need to find the mass flow rate of aluminum through the sprue:

Mass flow rate = Pouring rate × Sprue efficiency
Mass flow rate = 4 m³/s × 0.95
Mass flow rate = 3.8 m³/s

Now, we can calculate the choke area:

Choke Area = (2-10) [Metal] [Density] [L] [Time] [Sprue Efficiency] / [Mass flow rate]

Choke Area = (2-10) [2700 kg/m³] [950 kg/m³] [0.25 m] [4 s] [0.95] / [3.8 m³/s]

Choke Area = (2-10) [2700 kg/m³] [950 kg/m³] [0.25 m] [4 s] [0.95] / 3.8

Chvorinov's rule states that the solidification time (t) is proportional to the square of the casting dimensions (D and L) and inversely proportional to the mould constant (α):

Ch = (D^2 * L) / (α * π^2)

Given:
D = 750 mm
L = 1000 mm
α = 2 s/$mm^2$

Calculate Ch:
Ch = (750^2 * 1000) / (2 * π^2)
Ch = (562500000) / (12.56636025)
Ch = 448896.15

Now, we can find the solidification time (t) by using the Chvorinov number:

t = Ch / (D^2 / L)

t = 448896.15 / (750^2 / 1000)

To find the solidification time in minutes, we need to convert the time unit from seconds to minutes:

Material manufacturing,76,G-META-17-34,NUM,72,"During the end blow period in LD steelmaking, the de-carburization rate is expressed by the equation: dC/dt = -(c-c*). Here, c and c* are the instantaneous and equilibrium concentration of carbon in steel respectively, in units of wt.%. Given that c* = 0.04 wt.% and c( t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, the concentration of carbon in steel (in wt.%) at t= 1 min is? (answer up to three decimal places)","To find the concentration of carbon in steel at t = 1 min, we can use the given rate equation:

dC/dt = -(c - c*)

We are given the initial concentration, c(t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, and the equilibrium concentration, c* = 0.04 wt.%. We want to find the concentration at t = 1 min, c(t = 1 min).

First, let's find the change in carbon concentration, ΔC, over the time interval from 0 min to 1 min:

ΔC = c(t = 1 min) - c(t = 0 min)

Using the rate equation, we can write:

ΔC/dt = -(c(t = 1 min) - c*)

Now, we can set up the differential equation:

d(ΔC)/dt = -(c(t = 1 min) - c*)

To solve this equation, we need to make some assumptions about the behavior of the system. Let's assume that the change in carbon concentration is proportional to the difference between the instantaneous and equilibrium concentrations:

ΔC/dt ∝ (c(t = 1 min) - c*)

This assumption is consistent with the given rate equation. We can then write:

d(ΔC)/dt = k(c(t = 1 min) - c*)

where k is a constant of proportionality.

To find the value of k, we can use the initial conditions:

ΔC(t = 0 min) = 0
c(t = 0 min) = 0.4

From the initial conditions, we have:

ΔC(t = 0 min) = c(t = 0 min) - c* = 0.4 - 0.04 = 0.36

So,

k = ΔC(t = 0 min)/(c(t = 0 min) - c*) = 0.36/(0.4 - 0.04) = 0.9

Now, we can integrate the differential equation to find the change in carbon concentration at t = 1 min:

ΔC(t = 1 min) = ∫(k * (c(t = 1 min) - c*)) dt

Using the initial condition, we have:

ΔC(t = 1 min) = k * ∫(c(t = 1 min) - c*) dt

Substituting the value of k, we get:

ΔC(t = 1 min) = 0.9 * ∫(c(t = 1 min) - 0.04) dt

To find the value of the integral, we need to make some assumptions about the behavior of the system over time. Let's assume that the change in carbon concentration is linear over the time interval from 0 min to 1 min:

ΔC(t = 1 min) = 0.9 * (ΔC/dt) * Δt

Substituting the given value of Δt = 1 min, we get:

ΔC(t = 1 min) = 0.9 * (-(c(t = 1 min) - 0.04)) * 1

Rearranging the equation, we get:

c(t = 1 min) = 0.04 + ΔC(t = 1 min)/0.9

Substituting the value of ΔC(t = 1 min) from the integral equation, we get:

c(t = 1 min) = 0.04 + (0.9 * ΔC(t = 0 min))/(1 + 0.9)

Substituting the given value of ΔC(t = 0 min) = 0.36, we get:

c(t = 1 min) = 0.04 + (0.9 * 0.36)/(1 + 0.9)

Calculating the value, we get:

(answer up tp two decimal places) "," To find the height of the riser using Chvorinov's rule, we first need to determine the cooling rate for the casting and the riser.

Given:
- Casting dimensions: 5.0 cm * 5.0 cm * 5.0 cm
- Total time for solidification: 1.6 min
- Riser diameter-to-height ratio: 0.5
- Chvorinov's equation exponent (n) = 2

First, let's calculate the cooling rate for the casting:

Cooling rate for casting = (Total time for solidification) ^ (-1/n)
Cooling rate for casting = (1.6 min) ^ (-1/2)
Cooling rate for casting ≈ 1.41 min^-1

Next, let's calculate the cooling rate for the riser:

Given: Riser diameter-to-height ratio = 0.5

Let's assume the height of the riser is h. The diameter of the riser is then 0.5h.

The volume of the casting and the riser are equal:

(5.0 cm) * (5.0 cm) * (5.0 cm) = (0.5h) * (π * (0.5h) ^ 2)

Solving for h:

h ≈ 11.21 cm

Now, let's calculate the cooling rate for the riser:

Cooling rate for riser = (Time for riser solidification) ^ (-1/n)
Cooling rate for riser = (3.2 min) ^ (-1/2)
Cooling rate for riser ≈ 1.21 min^-1

Using Chvorinov's rule, the cooling rate for the riser should be twice the cooling rate for the casting:

Cooling rate for riser = 2 * Cooling rate for casting
Cooling rate for riser ≈ 2.82 min^-1

Now, let's find the height of the riser:

Height of riser = (Time for riser solidification) ^ (1/n) * (Cooling rate for casting) ^ (-1)
Height of riser = (3.2 min) ^ (1/2) * (1.41 min^-1) ^ (-1)
Height of riser ≈ 6.12 cm

So, the height of the riser should be approximately 6.12 cm (up to two decimal places).",,,0,

Maximum reduction = (angle of bite * roll diameter) / (2 * (1 + coeficient of friction))

Given:
angle of bite = 10° = 0.1745 radians
roll diameter = 450 mm = 0.45 m
coefficient of friction = not provided in the context

We need to find the coefficient of friction first. The context mentions that the slab is subjected to cold rolling, so we can assume a typical value for cold rolling. A common value for the coefficient of friction in cold rolling is around 0.1.

Now, we can calculate the maximum possible reduction:

Maximum reduction = (0.1745 radians * 0.45 m) / (2 * (1 + 0.1))
Maximum reduction = 0.0315 m
Maximum reduction = 31.5 mm

1. Calculate the oxygen partial pressure at the surface of the solid using the given total pressure and the volume fractions of argon and oxygen:

P\_O2 = P\_total \* (Volume fraction of oxygen)
P\_O2 = 1 atm \* 0.4
P\_O2 = 0.4 atm

1. Calculate the mass of coke charged:
Coke contains 90 wt.% carbon, so its mass is equal to the mass of iron produced multiplied by the carbon content of the coke and the mass ratio of coke to iron.


Mass of coke = Mass of iron * Carbon content of coke * Mass ratio of coke to iron

The quantity(in kg) of slag needed is?(round off to the nearest integer). ","To find the quantity of slag needed, we first need to determine the mass of sulphur in the steel that needs to be removed.

Mass of sulphur in steel = 1000 kg * 0.03 wt.%

First, let's calculate the activity coefficients of carbon and oxygen at the given temperature (1800K) and their respective concentrations in the steel.

1. Calculate the activity coefficients of carbon and oxygen using the given data:

Given: ΔG° = -19840 - 40.65 T J

First, let's find T in Kelvin:
T = 1800 K + 273.15 = 1827.15 K

Now, let's calculate the equilibrium constant Kc at 1800K:

ΔG° = ΔG°° + RT ln Kc

ΔG°° = -19840 J
R = 8.314 J.mol^-1.K^-1

ln Kc = (ΔG°° / RT)

ln Kc = (-19840 J / (8.314 J.mol^-1.K^-1 * 1827.15 K))

Kc ≈ 1.12 × 10^-5

γ∞C = 2.3 (given)
γ∞O = 1.5 (given)

Using Henry's law, we have:

KHc = γ∞C * Kc
KHo = γ∞O * Kc

Now, let's find KHc and KHo:

KHc = 2.3 * 1.12 × 10^-5 ≈ 2.594 × 10^-5
KHo = 1.5 * 1.12 × 10^-5 ≈ 1.686 × 10^-5

2. Calculate the concentrations of carbon and oxygen in the steel:

The given data states that the dissolved oxygen content in the steel is 0.03 wt.%, and the steel temperature is 1800K. We can calculate the mass of oxygen in the steel using the given wt.% and the molar mass of oxygen (MwO = 32 g/mol).

mass of oxygen = (0.03) * (mass of steel) * (MwO / 100)

Number of vinyl chloride units = 160 * (Molecular weight of vinyl chloride unit / Molecular weight of copolymer)

The degree of polymerization is,"To find the degree of polymerization (n) of isotactic polybutadiene with a molecular weight of 3 x $10^5$ g/mol, we first need to determine the relative molecular mass (Mmon) of the repeat unit. The context mentions that the repeat unit of polyethylene has a relative molecular mass of 28 g/mol. Since isotactic polybutadiene is a polymer of butadiene, its repeat unit has a relative molecular mass of 104 g/mol (C4H8).

Now, we can calculate the degree of polymerization by dividing the molecular weight of the polymer by the relative molecular mass of the repeat unit:

n = M -- / Mmon
n = 3 x $10^5$ g/mol / 104 g/mol

Explanation:

* Glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) is commonly used in various applications due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, good corrosion resistance, and excellent surface finish. It is often used in structures where light weight and high strength are required, such as in bridge components, pipes, and tanks. Therefore, option (C) does not provide the most suitable application for GFRP in Column II.
* SiC particle reinforced Al alloy (SiC/Al) is a high-performance composite material used in various engineering applications, such as aerospace, automotive, and energy industries, due to its high specific strength, excellent thermal and mechanical properties, and good wear resistance. It is often used in components that are subjected to high temperatures and high loads, such as engine components, turbine blades, and structural parts. Therefore, option (C) provides a suitable application for SiC/Al in Column II as high-performance skate boards do not require the high-temperature and high-load capabilities of this composite material.

The weight in kg of gallium (Ga) to be mixed with arsenic (As) for obtaining 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs) is,"To find the weight of gallium required to produce 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide, we first need to determine the molar amount of gallium and arsenic needed. Since the molar mass of gallium arsenide is the sum of the molar masses of gallium and arsenic, we can set up the following equation:

$M_(Ga)x_{Ga} + M_(As)x_{As} = M_(GaAs)1.0$

Where $x_{Ga}$ and $x_{As}$ represent the molar amounts of gallium and arsenic, respectively. Solving for $x_{Ga}$:

$x_{Ga} = \frac{M_(GaAs) - M_(As)x_{As}}{M_(Ga)}$

Substituting the given values:

$x_{Ga} = \frac{M_(GaAs) - 1.0 \cdot M_(As)}{M_(Ga)}$

$x_{Ga} = \frac{75.92g/mol - 1.0 \cdot 74.92g/mol}{69.72g/mol}$

$x_{Ga} = 0.0118$

Now that we have the molar amount of gallium, we can find its weight:

$w_{Ga} = x_{Ga} \cdot M_(Ga)$

$w_{Ga} = 0.0118 \cdot 69.72g/mol \cdot 1000g/kg$

$w_{Ga} = 77.55kg$

Therefore, 77.55 kg of gallium is required to produce 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide.",,,0,

The measured bulk density of this composite is 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$. If the theoretical density of SiC is 3.22 g $cm^(-3)$ and that of $Al_2O_3$ is 3.95 g $cm^(-3)$, estimate the porosity (%) of the composite, assuming that the linear rule of mixtures is valid in this case.","To estimate the porosity of the composite, we first need to find the total volume fraction of SiC and $Al_2O_3$ in the composite. We know that the volume fraction of SiC is 30%, so the volume fraction of $Al_2O_3$ is 100% - 30% = 70%.

Using the linear rule of mixtures, the total density of the composite can be calculated as:

ρ\_total = ρ\_SiC * V\_SiC + ρ\_Al2O3 * V\_Al2O3

where ρ\_SiC is the density of SiC, ρ\_Al2O3 is the density of $Al_2O_3$, V\_SiC is the volume fraction of SiC, and V\_Al2O3 is the volume fraction of $Al_2O_3$.

Substituting the given values, we have:

ρ\_total = 3.22 g $cm^(-3)$ * 0.3 + 3.95 g $cm^(-3)$ * 0.7 = 3.65 g $cm^(-3)$

Now we can find the volume fraction of porosity (V\_porosity) by subtracting the total volume fraction of solid components from 1:

V\_porosity = 1 - (V\_SiC + V\_Al2O3) = 1 - (0.3 + 0.7) = 0.3

The porosity (%) can be calculated by multiplying the volume fraction of porosity by 100:

Porosity = V\_porosity * 100% = 0.3 * 10.4 = 120%

However, the result is not physically meaningful as the porosity cannot be greater than 100%. This indicates that the assumption of the linear rule of mixtures being valid in this case may not be accurate. Therefore, the given data may not be sufficient to estimate the porosity of the composite accurately.

(Take the atomic weights for carbon and hydrogen as 12.01 g/mol and 1.008 g/mol, respectively and the avogadro's number as 6.023* $10^(23)$ repeat units/mol)","To find the density of a totally crystalline PE, we first need to determine the number of repeat units in one unit cell and then calculate the mass of the unit cell.

1. Find the number of repeat units in one unit cell:
Since two ethylene repeat units are contained within each unit cell, we have:
Number of repeat units = 2

2. Calculate the mass of one repeat unit:
Each repeat unit consists of 2 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.
Mass of one repeat unit = (2 * 12.01 g/mol) + (4 * 1.008 g/mol) = 28.052 g/mol

3. Calculate the mass of the unit cell:
Unit cell volume = 0.0933 $nm^3$ = 0.0933 * ($10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/nm$^3$) = 8.983 * $10^{-23}$ cm$^3$
Mass of the unit cell = Number of repeat units * Mass of one repeat unit = 2 * 28.052 g/mol = 56.104 g/mol

4. Convert the mass to density:
Density = Mass of the unit cell / Unit cell volume = 56.104 g/mol / (8.983 * $10^{-23}$ cm$^3$) = 6.27 g/cm$^3$

The mass of the sample in air is 2.67 g and its apparent mass in water is 1.67 g. Calculate the density of the sample in g $cm^(-3)$ (give answer up to 2 decimal places),"To calculate the density of the sample, we first need to find its true mass in water. The difference between its mass in air and its apparent mass in water represents the mass of the water that the sample displaces when submerged.

Apparent mass in water = mass in air - mass of displaced water

We know that the mass of 1 cm³ of water is 1.00 g, so we can find the volume of the sample by calculating the volume of the displaced water:

Volume of sample = mass of displaced water / density of water
Volume of sample = (mass of sample in air - mass of sample in water) / 1.00 g/cm³

Once we have the volume of the sample, we can calculate its density:

Density of sample = mass of sample / volume of sample

So, the calculation would look like this:

Volume of sample = (2.67 g - 1.67 g) / 1.00 g/cm³
Volume of sample = 1.00 cm³

Density of sample = 2.67 g / 1.00 cm³

The context provided discusses various ways to modify polymers, including the use of additives and the curing of liquid monomers. Among the polymers mentioned are epoxies. The question asks which method can be used to enhance creep resistance in epoxies.

The answer is (B) increasing the cross-link density. The context explains that many thermoset structures develop by condensation polymerization, which is different in chemical character to addition polymerization. It also mentions that final crosslinking is induced by heating in phenolic resins, which are also called thermosets. The increased cross-link density leads to a more rigid and less creep-prone polymer network.

Therefore, the other options are not correct:

(A) Increasing the bulkiness of side groups: While bulky side groups can affect the properties of polymers in various ways, they do not directly enhance creep resistance.

(C) Addition of plasticizers: Plasticizers are added to polymers to make them more flexible and easier to process. They do not enhance creep resistance.

(D) Annealing: Annealing is a thermal treatment used to improve the properties of polymers by allowing them to relax and eliminate internal stresses. It does not directly enhance creep resistance.",,,0,

However, we can make some educated guesses based on common materials science knowledge.

Creep resistance (P) is often associated with fine-grained microstructures, as grain boundaries act as barriers to dislocation motion and grain size plays a role in controlling the rate of creep deformation. Therefore, option A (P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1) seems plausible.

Elastic modulus enhancement (Q) can be achieved through the presence of coherent precipitates, which can strengthen the matrix material and increase its stiffness. Therefore, option C (P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3) could also be a valid answer.

If the degree of polymerization of polyethylene is 30000, the average molecular weight( in g $mol^(-1)$) is?(round off to nearest integer)"," To find the average molecular weight of polyethylene with a degree of polymerization of 30,000, we first need to determine the molecular weight of one repeat unit and then multiply it by the degree of polymerization.

1. Molecular weight of one repeat unit:
   - One repeat unit consists of 3 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms.
   - The molecular weight of one carbon atom is 12 g/mol, and the molecular weight of one hydrogen atom is 1 g/mol.

(round off to the nearest integer). ,"To find the mesh number of a sieve, we need to determine the number of wires per inch in the direction perpendicular to the apertures. We can use the following formula:

Mesh number = (number of wires per inch)^2

First, we need to find the number of wires per inch in the x-direction (direction perpendicular to the apertures). We can use the given diameter of the steel wire and the aperture size to calculate the number of wires per inch.

The number of wires per inch in the x-direction can be calculated using the following formula:

Number of wires per inch = (2 * √(area of aperture / area of one wire))

The area of one wire = π * (diameter / 2)^2

The area of aperture = π * (aperture size / 2)^2

Substituting the given values, we get:

Number of wires per inch = (2 * √(π * (74 µm / 2)^2 / π * (53 µm / 2)^2))

Number of wires per inch ≈ 11.2

(A) 44.9% (B) 66.1% (C) 55.1% (D) 34.9% ","To find the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel, we need to use the lever rule. The lever rule states that the weight percent of each phase in a two-phase equilibrium is proportional to the length of the lever arm of that phase, which is the difference between the composition of that phase and the eutectoid composition.

In this case, the eutectoid composition is 0.8% C for γ-phase and 0.02% C for α-phase. The composition of the steel is 0.45% C.

First, we need to calculate the weight % of α-phase and γ-phase using the lever rule:

Weight % of α-phase = (Composition of α - Eutectoid composition of α) / (Composition of γ - Eutectoid composition of γ) * (Weight % of C in steel - Eutectoid composition of γ)

Weight % of α-phase = (0.02 - 0.002) / (0.8 - 0.02) * (0.45 - 0.008) = 0.543

Weight % of γ-phase = 1 - Weight % of α-phase = 1 - 0.543 = 0.457

Now, we need to convert weight % to volume % using the molar volumes of α-Fe and γ-Fe:

Molar volume of α-Fe = 7.10 cm³/mol
Molar volume of γ-Fe = 7.10 cm³/mol + 5.34 cm³/mol (carbon) * 6.67 = 22.11 cm³/mol

Volume % of α-phase = (Weight % of α-phase / Total weight %) * (Molar volume of α-Fe / (Molar volume of α-Fe + Molar volume of γ-Fe))

Volume % of α-phase = (0.543 / 1) * (7.10.1 / (710.0 + 22110.67)) = 0.183

Therefore, the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel is approximately 18.3%.

So, the answer is (C) 55.1% is not correct. The correct answer is (B) 18.3% or (D) 18.3%. However, the question states that the answer is given as a volume %, so the answer should be rounded to two decimal places, which gives 18.15%. Therefore, the final answer is (D) 18.15%.",,,0,

Explanation:

For two phases (α and β) to be in equilibrium in a two-component system at constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs free energy change of the system (ΔG) should be zero. This is because at equilibrium, the system is at its minimum energy state.

Additionally, the chemical potentials of each component in each phase must be equal to each other at the same temperature and pressure. The chemical potential represents the maximum reversible work that can be done by a system at constant temperature and pressure, so when the chemical potentials of each component are equal in both phases, there is no net flow of material from one phase to another, and the system is at equilibrium.

The wt.% of A in α and β phases is 70 and 20, respectively. The wt.% of B in the alloy is? (round off to nearest integer) ","To find the weight percentage of B in the alloy, we can use the given information about the weight percentages of A in the α and β phases and the ratio of their weights.

Let x be the weight percentage of weight percentage of B in the alloy.

We know that the weight percentage of A in the α phase is 70%, so the weight percentage of B in the α phase is 100% - 70% = 30%.

Similarly, the weight percentage of A in the β phase is 20%, so the weight percentage of B in the β phase is 100% - 20% = 80%.

The ratio of the weights of the α and β phases is given as 4:1. Let's denote the weight of the α phase as Wα and the weight of the β phase as Wβ.

Since the weight percentage of A in the α phase is 70%, the weight of A in the α phase is 0.7 * Wα.

Similarly, the weight of A in the β phase is 0.2 * Wβ.

The total weight of A in the alloy is the sum of the weights of A in the α and β phases:

0.7 * Wα + 0.2 * Wβ = total weight of A

Since the ratio of the weights of the α and β phases is 4:1, we have Wα = 4 * Wβ.

Substituting this into the equation for the total weight of A, we get:

0.7 * (4 * Wβ) + 0.2 * Wβ = total weight of A

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3.4 * Wβ = total weight of A

We don't have enough information to determine the total weight of A, so we can'll find the weight percentage of B instead.

The total weight of the alloy is the sum of the weights of A and B:

total weight of A + total weight of B = total weight of the alloy

Since the weight percentage of A in the α phase is 70%, the weight of A in the α phase is 0.7 * total weight of the alloy.

Similarly, the weight of A in the β phase is 0.2 * total weight of the alloy.

The weight of B in the α phase is 30% of the weight of A in the α phase, so it is 0.3 * 0.7 * total weight of the alloy = 0.21 * total weight of the alloy.

The weight of B in the β phase is 80% of the weight of A in the β phase, so it is 0.8 * 0.2 * total weight of the alloy = 0.16 * total weight of the alloy.

The total weight of B is the sum of the weights of B in the α and β phases:

0.21 * total weight of the alloy + 0.16 * total weight of the alloy = total weight of B

Subtracting the weight of A from the total weight of the alloy and dividing by the total weight of the alloy, we get the weight percentage of B:

(total weight of the alloy - total weight of A) / total weight of the alloy = (total weight of B) / total weight of the alloy

Substituting the expressions for the weights of A and B that we found earlier, we get:

((total weight of the alloy - (0.7 * total weight of the alloy)) - (0.21 * total weight of the alloy)) / total weight of the alloy = (0.21 * total weight of the alloy + 0.16 * total weight of the alloy) / total weight of the alloy

Simplifying this equation, we get:

The phase rule for invariant reactions in a single phase states that DF = [(c – 1) π + 2] – [c (π – 1) + NIR], where NIR is the number of independent reactions. For a binary system at constant pressure, there are two types of invariant reactions: (i) α ↔ β + γ and (ii) α + β ↔ γ. Since both reactions involve three phases, NIR = 1 for each reaction type. Substituting the values into the equation, we have DF = [(2 – 1) 2 + 2] – [2 (2 – 1) + 1] = 3 – 3 = 0. This means that at constant pressure, only one type of invariant reaction can occur.

However, the question asks about the number of different types of invariant reactions that may exist under variable temperature and pressure.

Explanation:

With increasing degree of undercooling in a diffusional transformation, the rate of transformation initially increases due to an increase in the thermodynamic driving force (C). However, at very extensive degrees of undercooling, the rate of nucleation approaches exp [-Q/kT] and becomes small due to the slowness of atomic mobility (A).

The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is? (Round off to one decimal) ,"To find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture, we can use the lever rule given by Eq. (12.80) in the text:

ϕα = xβB−xoBxβ

We are given that phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B, so the mass fraction of A in phase α is 0.5. Since the atomic mass of A is twice that of B, the mole fraction of A in phase α is 0.25.

We are also given that phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B. Let xβA be the mole fraction of A in phase β. Then, the mole fraction of B in phase β is xβB = 1 - xβA.

The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, so their masses are equal. Let m be the mass of each phase. Since the mass of A in phase α is equal to the mass of A in phase β, we have:

m(0.5)(2mA) = m(xβA)(2mA + mB)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

m = (0.5)/(xβA + 0.5)

We know that the total mass of A and B in the system is m(xoA + xoB), where xoA and xoB are the overall mole fractions of A and B, respectively. Since the two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, the mass of A in the mixture is m(ϕα + ϕβ) = m(xβ + xα).

Using the given information, we can find xoA and xoB as follows:

xoA + xoB = 1
xoA = 0.5 (given)
xoB = 1 - xoA = 0.5

Now, we can find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture as follows:

m(xβ + xα) = m(xoA + xoB)
xβ + xα = xoA + xoB
xβ + 0.25 = 0.5
xβ = 0.25

Using this value of xβ, we can find xα = 1 - xβ = 0.75.

Finally, we can use the lever rule to find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture:

ϕα = xβB−xoBxβ
xα = 1−ϕα

ϕα = xβ / (xβ + xα)
xα = 1−xβ / (xβ + xα)

Substituting the values of xβ and xα, we get:

xα = 1−0.25 / (0.25 + 0.75) = 0.2

Therefore, the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is approximately 0.2 (rounded off to one decimal).",,,0,

The lever rule states that the ratio of the volumes of the phases in equilibrium is equal to the ratio of their mole fractions.

First, we need to calculate the mole fractions of each phase. The mole fraction of α-ferrite is 0.02 wt.% / (0.02 wt.% + 0.8 wt.% + 6.67 wt.%) = 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.8 + 6.67) = 0.02 / 6.71 ≈ 0.00297.

The mole fraction of austenite (γ-phase) is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.

The molar volumes of α and β phases are 7.377 $cm^3$ and 7.317 $cm^3$ , respectively. Assume that the difference in molar volumes of α and β is independent of pressure. The pressure (in atm) required for α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is (round off to nearest integer) "," To find the pressure required for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/P1) = ΔH/R × (1/T1 - 1/T2)

where P1 is the pressure at temperature T1 where the transformation occurs (1 atm), P2 is the pressure at temperature T2 where we want to find, ΔH is the enthalpy of transformation, and R is the gas constant.

First, we need to find ΔH. Since we are given the enthalpy of transformation at 773 K, we can use the given information to find ΔH:

ΔH = ΔHαβ = -912 J $mol^(−1)$

Next, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the pressure at 723 K:

ln(P2/1) = -912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (8.314 J $mol^(−1)$ K$^(−1)$) × (1/773 K - 1/T2)

Solving for P2:

P2 = 1 atm × exp(-912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (8.314 J $mol^(−1)$ K$^(−1)$) × (1/773 K - 1/T2))

We need to find T2 such that P2 is in atm and close to 1 atm. By trial and error, we find that T2 ≈ 732.5 K.

Now we can find P2:

P2 = 1 atm × exp(-912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (8.314 J $mol^(−1)$ K$^(−1)$) × (1/773 K - 1/732.5 K)) ≈ 1.015 atm

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is 1 atm. However, this is not correct since the answer should be greater than 1 atm.

During heating, Ti undergoes allotropic transformation from hcp to bcc at 882 °C. The percent volume change accompanying this transformation is (round off to 1 decimal place) ","To find the percent volume change during the allotropic transformation of Ti from hcp to bcc, we first need to calculate the volumes of the hcp and bcc unit cells.

The volume of an hcp unit cell can be calculated using the lattice parameter c and the volume of one unit cell in the simple cubic lattice with the same edge length a:

V\_hcp = a^2 * sqrt(16/3) * c

Given that a = 0.332 nm and c = 0.511 nm for hcp Ti, we have:

V\_hcp = (0.332 nm)^2 * sqrt(16/3) * 0.511 nm
V\_hcp ≈ 0.0424 nm^3

The volume of a bcc unit cell can be calculated using its lattice parameter a:

V\_bcc = a^3

Given that a = 0.332 nm for bcc Ti, we have:

V\_bcc = (0.332 nm)^3
V\_bcc ≈ 0.011 nm^3

The percent volume change during the transformation can be calculated as:

ΔV/V\_initial = (V\_final - V\_initial) / V\_initial

Since the mass of Ti remains constant during the transformation, we have:

m\_hcp = m\_bcc
n\_hcp * M\_hcp = n\_bcc * M\_bcc

where n is the number of unit cells in the sample and M is the atomic mass.

Given that there are 2 atoms per unit cell in hcp Ti and 4 atoms per unit cell in bcc Ti, we have:

n\_hcp = n\_bcc / 2

Substituting the given values, we have:

M\_hcp = 47.9 g/mol
M\_bcc = 47.9 g/mol
n\_hcp = n\_bcc / 2

Using Avogadro's number, we can find the number of unit cells in the sample:

n\_hcp = (m / (M\_hcp * N\_A))
n\_bcc = 2 * n\_hcp

where m is the mass of the sample.

Substituting the given values, we have:

m = 100 g

n\_hcp = (100 g) / (47.9 g/mol * 6.023 × 10^23)
n\_hcp ≈ 1.11 × 10^22
n\_bcc = 2 * n\_hcp ≈ 2.22 × 10^22

Now we can calculate the volumes and the percent volume change:

V\_initial = n\_hcp * V\_hcp
V\_final = n\_bcc * V\_bcc
ΔV = V\_final - V\_initial
ΔV/V\_initial = (ΔV / V\_initial)

Calculating the volumes and the percent volume change, we get:

V\_initial ≈ 4.85 × 10^-6 m^3
V\_final ≈ 2.43 × 10^-5 m^3
ΔV ≈ 9.8 × 10^-6 m^3
ΔV/V\_initial ≈ 20.2%

Monotectic reaction (S) is a reaction that occurs when a solid and a liquid react to form a new solid, and the solid phase that forms is the same as the initial solid but with a different composition.

Now, let's match the reactions in Group II with the names in Group I based on their descriptions:

1. 𝛾 + 𝛽 → 𝛼: This is a peritectic reaction because a solid (𝛾) and a liquid (𝛽) react to form a new solid (𝛼).
2. 𝐿 → 𝛼 + 𝛽: This is an eutectic reaction because two liquids (𝐿 and 𝛼) react to form a solid solution or a new compound.
3. 𝐿1 → 𝐿2 + 𝛼: This is a monotectic reaction because a solid (𝐿1) reacts with a liquid (𝐿2) to form a new solid (𝛼) with the same composition as the initial solid but different from the initial liquid.
4. 𝐿 + 𝛽 → 𝛼: This is a peritectoid reaction because a solid (𝐿) and a liquid (𝛽) react to form a new solid (𝛼), and the solid phase that reacts is the final solid product.

Explanation:

The Ellingham diagram is a graphical representation of the standard free energy change for various redox reactions involving metal-metal oxides. The C + $O_2$ = $CO_2$ line in an Ellingham diagram is nearly horizontal because $CO_2$ is a gaseous oxide, and its entropy change at standard state is large and approximately constant.

(B) GP zone → θ`` → θ`→ θ

Explanation:

The context mentions that during the subsequent cooling, the decomposition process of the β-phase is very slow, too. However, it also states that when the cooling rate is slow, the transformation will occur according to the Al-Cu binary alloy phase diagram. At high temperature, the transformation of β-phase → α-phase occurs first, followed by the precipitation of θ'' from the α-phase to form a laminar organization. Finally, the θ' phase forms from the θ'' phase. Therefore, the correct sequence is GP zone (primary precipitates) → θ'' (secondary precipitates) → θ' (tertiary precipitates).

In an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, the mass fraction of pearlilte just below the eutectoid temperature is? (answer up to two decimal places)","To find the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature, we first need to determine the mass fractions of ferrite and cementite in the eutectoid composition.

Given:
eutectoid composition = 0.8 wt.% carbon
carbon content in ferrite = 0.025 wt.%

We know that the eutectoid composition is a mixture of ferrite and cementite. Since the carbon content in ferrite is much lower than in cementite, we can assume that the mass fraction of ferrite is higher. Let x be the mass fraction of ferrite in the eutectoid composition. Then, the mass fraction of cementite is 1 - x.

We have two equations:

x * 0.025 = 0.08 * 10000 / (10000 + 10000 * 0.08)
(1 - x) * 0.067 = 10000 * 0.08 / (10000 + 10000 * 0.08)

Solving these equations, we get x = 0.71 and (1 - x) = .29.

Now, let's find the mass fraction of pearlite in an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, just below the eutectoid temperature. Since the temperature is just below the eutectoid temperature, we can assume that the alloy is in the two-phase region of pearlite and austenite. Let y be the mass fraction of pearlite. Then, the mass fraction of austenite is 1 - y.

We have one equation:

y * (0.025 + 0.35) + (1 - y) * 0.008 = 1

Solving this equation, we get y = .68.

So, the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature in an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C is approximately 0.68 or 68%.

The transformation (in %) in 400s is? (answer up to two decimal places)","To find the transformation percentage after 400 seconds, we can use the Avrami equation:

X(t) = 1 - e^(-kt^n)

where X(t) is the fraction transformed at time t, k is the rate constant, and n is the Avrami exponent.

We are given that X(100s) = 0.2 and n = 2. We need to find X(400s).

First, we need to find the rate constant k. We can rearrange the Avrami equation to solve for k:

ln[1 - X(t)] = ln[k] + n * ln[t]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln[1 - 0.2] = ln[k] + 2 * ln[100]

Using a calculator, we find:

ln[0.8] ≈ -0.2231
ln[100] ≈ 4.6052

Substituting these values:

-0.2231 = ln[k] + 2 * 4.6052

Solving for k:

ln[k] ≈ -0.2231 - 2 * 4.6052
ln[k] ≈ -10.6285
k ≈ e^(-10.6285)
k ≈ 4.14 * 10^(-5)

Now we can find X(400s):

X(400s) = 1 - e^(-4.14 * 10^(-5) * 400^2)
X(400s) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.0657)
X(400s) ≈ 1 - 0.4873
X(400s) ≈ 0.5127

The transformation is approximately 51.27% complete after 400 seconds.

Phase transition,31,G-META-19-5,MCQS-NUM,40,Liquid steel is kept in a graphite crucible for sufficiently long time such that equilibrium is established. Activity of carbon (with respect to graphite as the standard state) in the liquid is?  (A) 0.0 (B) 0.5 (C) 1.0 (D) 2.0," The activity of carbon in the liquid steel with respect to graphite as the standard state is not given directly in the context. However, we can estimate it using the equilibrium partition coefficient (Kp) of carbon between liquid steel and graphite.

The partition coefficient (Kp) is defined as the ratio of the activity of a substance in two phases at equilibrium. In this case, we are interested in the partition coefficient of carbon between liquid steel and graphite.

The given context mentions that the carbon concentration in the steel and graphite is kept constant at Cs=1% and Cb=0.25%, respectively. We can use this information to calculate the partition coefficient.

First, we need to calculate the activity coefficients of carbon in the liquid steel and graphite using the activity coefficient model (e.g., the regular solution model). The activity coefficients are not given in the context, so we cannot calculate them directly. However, we can use the given solubility limits (Cb and Cs) to estimate the interaction parameter (W) and the solubility limits at different temperatures using the regular solution model.

Once we have the activity coefficients, we can calculate the partition coefficient (Kp) as the ratio of the activity of carbon in the liquid steel to the activity of carbon in the graphite.

The activity of carbon in the graphite is assumed to be equal to its activity in the standard state (graphite), which is usually taken to be 1.

Therefore, the activity of carbon in the liquid steel with respect to graphite as the standard state is Kp = (activity coefficient of carbon in liquid steel) / (activity coefficient of carbon in graphite).

Without the activity coefficients, we cannot calculate the exact value of Kp and the activity of carbon in the liquid steel. However, we can make some general observations based on the given information.

Since the carbon concentration in the steel is higher than in the graphite, we expect the activity coefficient of carbon in the steel to be greater than that in the graphite. Therefore, the partition coefficient (Kp) is expected to be greater than 1.

Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and B, which are less than 1. Option C, 1.0, is a reasonable estimate if the activity coefficients are similar in the liquid steel and graphite. However, without the actual values, we cannot be certain that the activity of carbon in the liquid steel is exactly 1.0. Therefore, option D, 2.0, is not a valid answer, as it is greater than what we expect based on the given information.

So, the answer is (C) 1.0, with some uncertainty due to the lack of activity coefficient data.",,,0,

The volume of a BCC unit cell can be calculated using the formula V = a³, where a is the lattice parameter. Similarly, the volume of an FCC unit cell can be calculated using the formula V = (√2/4)a³.

The volume ratio of BCC to FCC can be calculated as:

V(BCC) / V(FCC) = (aBCC)³ / [(√2/4)(aFCC)³]

Substituting the given lattice parameters, we get:

V(BCC) / V(FCC) = (0.293 nm)³ / [(√2/4)(0.363 nm)³]

ΔHm = 13 $kJ.mol^(-1)$

We need to find ΔG at 1353 K.

First, we need to find the entropy of fusion (ΔS) using the given enthalpy of fusion and the temperature at which it occurs.

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

We can use the following equation to find ΔS:

ΔS = ΔH / T

Substituting the given values:

ΔS = 13 $kJ.mol^(-1)$ / 1356 K
ΔS ≈ 0.0096 $kJ.mol^(-1) / K$

Now, we can calculate ΔG at 1353 K:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
ΔG = 13 $kJ.mol^(-1)$ - 1353 K × 0.0096 $kJ.mol^(-1) / K$
ΔG ≈ -12.98 $kJ.mol^(-1)$

Since ΔG is negative, the process is spontaneous, and the system will tend to transform from liquid to solid. However, the magnitude of the driving force is the absolute value of ΔG.

We can use the following equation to calculate the free energy change:

where ΔH is the enthalpy change and ΔS is the entropy change. Since we are assuming that the specific heat capacity is the same for the solid and liquid phases, we can use the given enthalpy of melting to calculate the enthalpy change.

First, we need to calculate the entropy change. The entropy change for the melting process can be calculated using the given enthalpy of melting and the temperature difference between the melting point and the given temperature.

ΔH = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$

In this case, the eutectoid composition is 0.8 wt.% C, and the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe is 0.025 wt.% C. The composition of the steel sample is 0.6 wt.% C.

First, we need to calculate the distance from the eutectoid composition to the solubility limit of α-Fe, and the distance from the eutectoid composition to the composition of the steel sample.

The distance from the eutectoid composition to the solubility limit of α-Fe is:

1. Calculate the mass loss of the Mg anode:
The atomic weight of Mg is 24.31 amu, and its mass is 1 kg. We can find the number of moles of Mg in the anode:

Number of moles = Mass / Atomic weight
= 1 kg / 24.31 g/mol
≈ 40.85 mol

Since the anode lasts for 60 days, the mass loss per day is:

Mass loss per day = Mass of anode / Duration
= 1 kg / 60 days
≈ 16.67 g/day

Now, we can find the mass loss of Mg in moles per day:

Mass loss per day (moles) = Mass loss per day / Atomic weight
= 16.67 g/day / 24.31 g/mol
≈ 0.0683 mol/day

2. Convert mass loss to current flow rate:
The chemical reaction is:
2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

Since there are two moles of Mg atoms reacting for every mole of O2, the molar ratio of Mg to O2 is 2:1. The molar mass of Mg is 24.31 g/mol, and the molar mass of O2 is 32.00 g/mol.

The formula for the corrosion current (I) is:

I = (Mass loss per day / (Molar mass of Mg * Molar ratio of Mg to O2)) * (Number of electrons transferred per mole of Mg)

The number of electrons transferred per mole of Mg is 2, as Mg loses 2 electrons during the corrosion process.

I = (0.0683 mol/day / (24.31 g/mol * 2)) * 2 * (1 Faraday / 1 g-mol)

The Nernst equation relates the potential difference between two electrodes to the concentration of the ions involved in the half-cell reactions.

First, let's calculate the potential difference in the reduction potentials of Ni and Cd:

$E_{cell} = E_{Cd} - E_{Ni} = -0.403 V - (-0.250 V) = -0.153 V$

Since the voltage of the cell is zero, the potential difference between the two electrodes must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Therefore, the potential difference between the Ni and Cd electrodes in the given cell setup is 0.153 V.

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution:

$E_{cell} = E_{cell}^{0} + \frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{a_{Cd}}{a_{Ni}}\right)$

Since the temperature and pressure are given as constant (25°C and 1 atm), and the concentrations of $Cd^{2+}$ ions are given as 1 M, the activity of $Cd^{2+}$ ions is 1. We can assume that the activity of $Ni^{2+}$ ions is $a_{Ni}$ and the number of electrons transferred in the half-cell reactions is $n = 2$.

$a_{Ni} = e^{\frac{(2)(96500 C/mol)(0.153 V)}{(8.31 J/mol\cdot K)(298.15 K)}} = e^{\frac{3.11\times10^{4}}{2.48\times10^{4}}} = 1.31$

Since the activity is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the ions in the solution to the concentration in the standard state, we can find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions by multiplying the activity by the standard concentration:

$[Ni^{2+}] = a_{Ni}[Ni^{2+}]^{0} = 1.31(1 M) = 1.31 M$

To convert the concentration to micro molar, we multiply by $10^{6}$:

$[Ni^{2+}] = 1.31 M \times 10^{6} \mu mol/L = 1.31\times10^{8} \mu mol/L$

So, the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution is approximately 1.31 × 10^8 μmol/L.

Hall effect measurement shows electron mobility to be 3.2 * $10^(-3)m^(2)V^(-1)s^(-1)$. Electrical resistivity of copper is 1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm. The average number of free electrons per atom in copper is ?,"To find the average number of free electrons per atom in copper, we can use the electrical resistivity and electron mobility.

First, we need to find the number of free electrons per unit volume (N\_e) using the electrical resistivity:

ρ = ρ\_0 * (m * N\_e)

where ρ\_0 is the resistivity of free space (approximately 1.67 x 10^-7 Ωm), m is the mass of an electron, and N\_e is the number of free electrons per unit volume.

Solving for N\_e:

N\_e = ρ / (ρ\_0 * m)

Substituting the given values:

N\_e = 1.7 * 10^-8 Ωm / (1.67 * 10^-7 Ωm * 9.10953 x 10^-31 kg)
N\_e ≈ 8.48 * 10^28 m^-3

Next, we need to find the number of free electrons per atom. Since copper is an FCC metal with a lattice parameter of 3.62 Å, we can use Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) and the molar mass of copper (63.55 g/mol) to find the number of atoms per unit volume:

N\_A = 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol / (63.55 g/mol * 1000 g/kg)
N\_A ≈ 5.85 x 10^29 atoms/m^3

Finally, we can find the average number of free electrons per atom by dividing the number of free electrons per unit volume by the number of atoms per unit volume:

Number of free electrons per atom = N\_e / N\_A

Substituting the values:

Number of free electrons per atom = 8.48 * 10^28 m^-3 / 5.85 * 10^29 atoms/m^3
Number of free electrons per atom ≈ 1.46

(Round off to two decimal places).   "," To find the potential of the reaction against a $Zn^{2+}/Zn$ reference electrode, we need to use the Nernst equation and the standard potentials given.

First, let's find the standard potential difference between $Li^+/Li$ and $Zn^{2+}/Zn$ reference electrodes:

ΔE° = E° ($Li^+/Li$) - E° ($Zn^{2+}/Zn$)
ΔE° = (-3.04 V) - (-0.77 V)
ΔE° = -2.27 V

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the potential difference at the given reaction condition:

E = E° + (RT/nF)ln(Q)

where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature (assumed to be 298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (assumed to be 1), and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).

We are given the potential difference against the $Li^+/Li$ reference electrode (4.50 V), so we can find the reaction quotient Q:

Q = [$Li^+$]_[Li] = 1 (since the reaction is at unit activity for the $Li^+$ electrode)

Now, we can find the potential difference against the $Zn^{2+}/Zn$ reference electrode:

What is the capacitance of this capacitor in nF?," The capacitance of a capacitor with a dielectric material between the plates is given by the equation C = εA/d, where ε is the permittivity of the dielectric material, A is the electrode area, and d is the thickness of the dielectric material.

Given that the thickness of the BaTiO3 dielectric is 0.075 cm, the electrode area is 0.2 cm2, and the dielectric constant is 2000, we can calculate the capacitance as follows:

C = ε0 * εr * A / d

where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 x 10-12 F/m), and εr is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of BaTiO3.

The concentration(in micro molar) of $Ni^(2+)$ in the solution is ","To find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution, we can use the Nernst equation and the given information. The Nernst equation relates the potential difference between two electrodes to the concentration of the ions involved in the half-cell reactions.

First, let's calculate the potential difference in the reduction potentials of Ni and Cd:

$E_{cell} = E_{Cd} - E_{Ni} = -0.403 V - (-0.250 V) = -0.153 V$

Since the voltage of the cell is zero, the potential difference between the two electrodes must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Therefore, the potential difference between the Ni and Cd electrodes in the given cell setup is 0.153 V.

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution:

$E_{cell} = E_{cell}^{0} + \frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{a_{Cd}}{a_{Ni}}\right)$

Since the temperature and pressure are given as constant (25°C and 1 atm), and the concentrations of $Cd^{2+}$ ions are given as 1 M, the activity of $Cd^{2+}$ ions is 1. We can assume that the activity of $Ni^{2+}$ ions is $a_{Ni}$ and the number of electrons transferred in the half-cell reactions is $n = 2$.

$0.153 V = (-0.153 V)^{0} + \frac{(8.31 J/mol\cdot K)(298.15 K)}{(2)(96500 C/mol)}ln\left(\frac{1}{a_{Ni}}\right)$

Solving for $a_{Ni}$:

$a_{Ni} = e^{\frac{(2)(96500 C/mol)(0.153 V)}{(8.31 J/mol\cdot K)(298.15 K)}} = e^{\frac{3.11\times10^{4}}{2.48\times10^{4}}} = 1.38$

Since the activity is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the ions in the solution to the concentration in the standard state, we can find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions by multiplying the activity by the standard concentration:

$[Ni^{2+}] = a_{Ni}[Ni^{2+}]^{0} = 1.38(1 M) = 1.38 M$

To convert the concentration to micro molar, we multiply by $10^{6}$:

$[Ni^{2+}] = 1.38 M \times 10^{6} \mu mol/L = 1.38\times10^{8} \mu mol/L$

So, the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution is approximately $1.38\times10^{8} \mu mol/L$.

(A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure (B) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure (C) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure (D) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and pressure," The correct answer is C. Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure for an intrinsic semiconductor.

Explanation: Intrinsic semiconductors have conductivity due to the presence of free electrons and holes in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. The number of free electrons and holes increases with increasing temperature due to thermal excitation. However, the increase in temperature also increases the rate of recombination of electrons and holes, which reduces the conductivity. On the other hand, increasing pressure can lead to an increase in the number of free carriers due to the Pauli exclusion principle and the resulting increase in density of states near the Fermi level. Therefore, the net effect of increasing pressure is an increase in conductivity for an intrinsic semiconductor.

However, in general, the electrical resistivity of metals typically decreases with increasing temperature due to the increase in the number of free electrons available for conduction. In contrast, the electrical resistivity of intrinsic semiconductors usually increases with temperature due to the increase in the number of thermal excitations that can move electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, increasing the number of charge carriers and decreasing the resistivity, but the resistivity eventually increases due to the increase in phonon scattering which hinders the movement of charge carriers.

First, let's calculate the electrical energy required to deposit one kilogram of zinc using Faraday's law:

1 kg Zn = 65 g-eq Zn = 65 g Zn / (2 g-eq Cu/F) = 32.69 g-eq Cu

Using Faraday's law, we know that 1 F charge deposits 31.77 g of Cu. So, 32. 32.69 g-eq Cu requires:

Energy (kJ) = 32.69 g-eq Cu x 96,500 C/g-eq x 3.5 V

Q = exp((2 × 0.5 V + 1.20 V)/(RT))

We don't have the exact values of the concentrations, but we can make some assumptions based on the given information. Since the cell discharges spontaneously, it means that the reaction quotient is greater than 1 at the given temperature and concentration. Therefore, the concentration of $[Fe^{2+}]$ is greater than the concentration of $[Zn^{2+}]$.

Let's assume that the concentration of $[Fe^{2+}]$ is 10 times greater than the concentration of $[Zn^{2+}]$. We can calculate the concentration ratio and check if it is consistent with the given information.

[Fe2+] = 10[Zn2+]

Q = [Fe2+]2/[Zn2+]2 = ≈ 102

Now, we can calculate the voltage using the Nernst equation:

0.5 V = -1.20 V + (RT/2) ln(102)

We can check if this voltage is consistent with the given information. If it is, then the assumption is valid. If not, we need to make a different assumption.

E = -0.447 V + 0.0591 V = -0.388 V

i = 10^-3 A/cm^2 × exp((0.06 V × 2 × 96,485 C/mol / (8.314 J/mol K × 298 K)) × 0.012 V)

i = 1.23 × 10^-2 A/cm^2 (rounded off to three decimal places)

However, we also need to take into account the effect of oxygen diffusion on the current density. We can use the diffusion equation to calculate the current density due to oxygen diffusion:

i = (nFD)(DC/δ)

Given that the pressure of Cl2 gas is 0.5 atm, we can assume that the activity of Cl2 is 1 (since the ideal gas law applies well to gases at 1 atm and above).

aC = 1 (since graphite is a solid and its activity is usually assumed to be 1)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Q = (0.18)2 / (0.72)2

Now, we can rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for ΔG°:

ΔG° = -n * E * F / R * T + n * R * T * ln(Q)

Explanation:

The assertion ""During rolling, front tension and (or) back tension are employed to decrease rolling load"" is true. The use of front tension and back tension in rolling processes helps to reduce the rolling load by decreasing the contact pressure between the workpiece and the roll.

The reason given ""Roll pressure decreases due to lowering of flow stress as a result of front tension/back tension"" is also true. When front tension is applied to the workpiece in front of the roll, it causes the material to stretch and align in the direction of rolling, which reduces the flow stress and makes it easier for the roll to deform the material. Similarly, back tension applied behind the roll helps to prevent wrinkling and buckling of the workpiece during rolling.

Explanation: Nitriding is a surface hardening process that involves the introduction of nitrogen into the surface of a steel component. It does not require quenching to obtain the final case hardness because the hardening process occurs through the diffusion of nitrogen into the steel at relatively low temperatures (around 500-550°C).

(A) Reducing carbon content (B) Increasing carbon content (C) Eliminating strong carbide formers (D) Decreasing chromium content," The correct answer is (D) Decreasing chromium content.

Explanation: Weld decay is a form of sensitization that occurs in austenitic stainless steels due to the depletion of chromium in the weld zone, making it more susceptible to corrosion. To avoid weld decay, a small amount (0.5%) of a strong carbide-former such as Nb or Ti is added to the steel to associate with the carbon in preference to the Cr, preventing the chromium from being depleted and maintaining the passive oxide film.

Explanation:

Grain size strengthening (P) is typically achieved by reducing the grain size, which makes it more difficult for dislocations to move through the grains, leading to an increase in strength. This mechanism is often referred to as the Hall-Petch effect and can be described as the Lomer-Cottrell barrier (3) formed at the grain boundaries.

Work hardening (Q) is a result of the deformation process, where dislocations are introduced into the material, making it harder to deform further. This mechanism is often described as Orowan looping (1), where dislocations interact with each other and form loops, increasing the resistance to dislocation motion.

Dispersion strengthening (R) is achieved by adding small, second-phase particles to the alloy, which act as barriers to dislocation motion. This mechanism can be described as the dislocation pileup at grain boundaries (2), where dislocations accumulate at the boundaries due to the presence of the second-phase particles.

Solid solution hardening (S) is a result of the addition of solute atoms to the solvent matrix, which increase the lattice strain and make it more difficult for dislocations to move through the material.

The density of the as-pressed aluminium compact is 1755 kg.$m^(-3)$. If the height of the as-pressed compact is 12 mm, the fill height (in mm) required is?","To find the fill height required, we first need to determine the volume of the as-pressed compact.

The density of the as-pressed compact is given as 1755 kg/m³. The volume of the compact can be calculated using its mass and density:

Volume = Mass / Density

First, we need to convert the mass of the compact from kg to kg.m³:

Mass = Density × Volume
Mass = 1755 kg/m³ × Volume

Rearranging the equation to solve for volume:

Volume = Mass / Density
Volume = (1755 kg/m³) × H

Where H is the height of the compact in meters. Since the height is given as 12 mm, we need to convert it to meters:

H = 12 mm = 0.012 m

Substituting the values into the equation:

Volume = (1755 kg/m³) × 0.012 m

Now, we need to find the volume of the cylindrical die that contains the compact. The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using its height and base area:

Volume = πr²h

Where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height. The apparent density of the aluminium powder is given as 810 kg/m³. We can assume that the volume of the compact before pressing is the same as the volume of the powder that was used to make it.

The mass of the powder that was used to make the compact can be calculated using its density and volume:

Mass = Density × Volume
Mass = 810 kg/m³ × V

Where V is the volume of the compact before pressing. Since the density of the compact after pressing is higher than the density of the powder, the volume of the compact before pressing must be smaller than the volume of the die.

We can set up an equation to find the volume of the die that is required to contain the compact:

Mass_compact = Mass_powder
(Density_compact × Volume_compact) = (Density_powder × Volume_die)

Substituting the given densities and the volume of the compact after pressing that we calculated earlier:

(1755 kg/m³ × 0.012 m³) = (810 kg/m³ × V_die)

Solving for V_die:

V_die = (1755 kg/m³ × 0.012 m³) / (810 kg/m³)

The answer is: [V_die]

Note: The exact value of V_die cannot be given without knowing the radius of the cylindrical die.

Explanation:

Brazing is a welding process that uses a filler material to melt and flow into the gap between two metal pieces, forming a joint. For brazing steel sheets, it is important to use a filler material with a melting point lower than that of steel but higher than the temperature at which the steel pieces are being heated. Near-eutectic alloys are suitable for this purpose because they have a low melting point due to their eutectic composition, but they also have good wetting properties and low shrinkage during solidification. This makes them ideal for filling the gap between steel sheets during brazing.

Epoxy resins are not suitable for brazing as they are not metallic and do not melt to form a liquid filler material. Refractory alloys have high melting points and are not typically used as brazing filler materials. Large freezing range alloys may not be suitable for brazing as they may take a long time to solidify, which can lead to problems with the joint quality.",,,0,

Pressure die casting involves the use of a die to force molten metal into a cavity. The high pressure used results in a smoother surface finish compared to other casting processes.

Sand casting is a traditional casting process where molten metal is poured into a sand mold. The sand mold provides a rough surface, which can result in a rough casting surface.

Permanent mold casting involves the use of a reusable mold, which is made of metal or other materials. The mold provides a smoother surface finish compared to sand casting, but it is not as smooth as pressure die casting.

Investment casting is a precision casting process where a wax pattern is used to create a ceramic mold. The ceramic mold is then heated to melt out the wax, leaving a cavity that is filled with molten metal. The process involves multiple steps, including wax melting, ceramic mold heating, and metal pouring.

Contribution to dilution of the weld pool is 20% from each plate. The Ni content(in wt.%) in the weld pool is?(round off to the nearest integer)","To calculate the Ni content in the weld pool, we need to use the given composition of the plates, the fusion ratio, and the relative fusion ratio of the base metals.

First, let's calculate the mass fractions of Ni in each plate:

Plate 1: Fe-10 wt.% Ni => 90 wt.% Fe, 10 wt.% Ni => 0.09 x 100 + 0.1 x 100 = 99.09 wt.% Fe, 0.01 x 100 = 1.91 wt.% Ni
Plate 2: Fe-20 wt.% Cr-5 wt.% Ni => 95 wt.% Fe, 2 wt.% Cr, 5 wt.% Ni => 0.95 x 100 + 0.02 x 100 + 0.05 x 100 = 99.55 wt.% Fe, 0.005 x 100 = 0.45 wt.% Ni

The total mass of the plates is:
Total mass = mass of Plate 1 + mass of Plate 2
Total mass = (mass of Plate 1) x (density of Plate 1) + (mass of Plate 2) x (density of Plate 2)

Let's assume the densities of the plates are the same for simplicity:

Total mass = (mass of Plate 1) x 7850 kg/m3 + (mass of Plate 2) x 7850 kg/m3

Since the contribution to dilution of the weld pool is 20% from each plate, the mass of each plate is:

mass of Plate 1 = Total mass x 0.2 / (1 + 0.2) = Total mass x 0.1818
mass of Plate 2 = Total mass x 0.2 / (1 + 0.2) = Total mass x 0.1818

Now, let's calculate the mass fractions of Ni in the weld pool:

mass fraction of Ni from Plate 1 = 0.0191 x 0.1818 / (0.09909 + 0.0191)
mass fraction of Ni from Plate 2 = 0.0045 x 0.1818 / (0.9955 + 0.0045)

The total mass fraction of Ni in the weld pool is:

total mass fraction of Ni = mass fraction of Ni from Plate 1 + mass fraction of Ni from Plate 2

To find the Ni content in wt.%, we need to convert the total mass fraction of Ni to wt.%:

Ni content in wt.% = total mass fraction of Ni x 100%

Then, we can use the melting factor and heat transfer factor to determine the volume of molten metal produced, and finally, the cross-sectional area.

1. Energy input per unit length:
Energy input = Power * Travel time
Power = 3000 W
Travel speed = 6 mm/s
Travel time = 1 mm / Travel speed = 0.167 s
Energy input = 3000 W * 0.167 s = 500.2 J/mm

2. Volume of molten metal:
Melting factor = 0.5
Heat transfer factor = 0.6
Energy required to melt unit volume = 6 J/mm³
Energy input per unit length = 500.2 J/mm
Energy required to melt unit volume = 6 J/mm³

Volume of molten metal = 500.2 J/mm / 6 J/mm³ = 83.367 mm³

Heat input (W) = (Voltage (V) × Current (A) × Time (s)) / Efficiency (η)

Since both welds have identical heat input, we can set up the equation as follows:

Heat input (W) = (18 V × Current1 (A) × 0.002 s) / 0.65
Heat input (W) = (18 V × Current2 (A) × 0.0022 s) / 0.65

y = (x × 0.0022 s) / (0.002 s × 0.65) × 18 V

Simplifying the equation:

y = (1.11 × x) / 0.65

Find the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$," To find the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient of copper atoms in aluminium is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$, we can use the given relationship between the natural logarithm of the diffusion coefficient and inverse absolute temperature: In D = lnD0 - (Q/R)(1/T), where D0 is the diffusion coefficient at a reference temperature, Q is the activation energy for diffusion, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

We are given the diffusion coefficients at two temperatures, so we can find the activation energy Q by taking the difference between the natural logarithms of the diffusion coefficients and dividing by the inverse absolute temperature difference:

Q = R[(In(5.75 x $10^(-19)$ $m^2s^(-1)) - In(1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1))] / [1/(500K) - 1/(400K)]

First, we need to calculate the natural logarithms of the given diffusion coefficients:

In(1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1)) = -21.2153
In(5.75 x $10^(-19)$ $m^2s^(-1)) = -19.2153

Now, we can find the difference and divide by the inverse temperature difference:

Q = R[(In(5.75 x $10^(-19)$ $m^2s^(-1)) - In(1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1))] / [1/(500K) - 1/(400K)]

In D = lnD0 - (Q/R)(1/T)

First, we need to find the diffusion depth in the first experiment at 400 °C. We don't have the exact concentration or depth given, but we can assume that the concentration is constant throughout the given depth, and we can use the given diffusion coefficients and time to find the diffusion depth.

At 400 °C, D = 5*$10^(-14) m^2s^(-1), and t = 100 hours = 3.15*$10^7 seconds.

Using the above equation, we can find the square of the diffusion depth (x^2):

The activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al in kJ/mol is,"To find the activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al, we can use the given relationship between the diffusion coefficient and temperature:

In D = lnD0 - (Q/R)(1/T)

We have two measurements of D at different temperatures (500 °C and 550 °C), so we can solve for Q by taking the difference between the two expressions for In D and setting them equal to each other:

In D(550 °C) - In D(500 °C) = ln(5.8*10^(-10) / 1.9*10(-13)) = ln(3.03) = 1.097

-(Q/R)(1/550 °C - 1/500 °C) = 1.097

-(Q/R)[1/(550 + 500) - 1/(2*500)] = 1.097

-(Q/R)[1/(1000) - 1/(1000)] = 1.097777

Q/R = 1.097 / (1.077 - 1) = 1.113

Q = 1.113 * R * (1/T)

where T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

To find the activation energy, we can rearrange the equation:

Q = ΔH*

ΔH* = Q * R * T

Substituting the value of Q, we get:

ΔH* = 1.113 * 8.314 * T J/mol

To find the activation energy, we need to determine the value of T at which ΔH* = ΔH, the activation energy for diffusion. We can use the given data to find ΔH:

ΔH = ΔGo = 4556.22 cal/mol = 4556.22 * 4.184 J/cal * mol = 19,161 J/mol

Setting ΔH* = ΔH and solving for T, we get:

Given that the diffusion coefficient (D) of gallium in silicon at 1355 °C is 6×$10^(−11)$ $cm^2$ $s^(−1)$, the time(in seconds) the silicon wafer should be heated in contact with gallium vapour at 1355 °C is","To find the time it takes for gallium to diffuse into the silicon wafer such that its concentration at a depth of $10^(−3)$ cm is one half the surface concentration, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion.

First, we need to find the surface concentration of gallium. Let's call this $C_0$. Since we want the concentration at a depth of $10^(−3)$ cm to be one half the surface concentration, we have:

$$C(10^(−3) \text{ cm}) = \frac{1}{2}C_0$$

We can use this information to find the diffusion length ($L$) using Fick's second law:

$$\frac{dC}{dt} = D\frac{d^2C}{dx^2}$$

At the surface ($x=0$), we have a constant concentration of gallium, so the derivative of the concentration with respect to $x$ is zero:

$$\frac{dC(dC/dx)}{dx}\bigg|_{x=0} = 0$$

At the depth where we want the concentration to be one half the surface concentration, we have:

$$\frac{dC}{dx}\bigg|_{x=L} = -\frac{C_0}{2L}$$

We can integrate Fick's second law over the thickness of the silicon wafer to find the time it takes to reach this concentration:

$$\int_{0}^{L} \frac{dC}{dt} dx = \int_{0}^{L} D\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} dx$$

Using the boundary conditions, we can evaluate the integrals:

$$\int_{0}^{L} \frac{dC}{dt} dx = \int_{0}^{L} D\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} dx = \frac{D}{2} \int_{0}^{L} \frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{dC}{dx}\right) dx = \frac{D}{2} \left[\frac{dC}{dx}\right]_{0}^{L}$$

Substituting the boundary conditions, we get:

$$\int_{0}^{L} \frac{dC}{dt} dx = \frac{DC_0}{2L} \left[x\right]_{0}^{L} = \frac{DC_0L}{2}$$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t = \frac{L^2C_0}{2D}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$t = \frac{(10^(−3) \text{ cm})^2(C_0)}{2(6×10^(−11) \text{ cm}^2 \text{ s}^(−1))}$$

Since we don't know the surface concentration ($C_0$), we can't directly calculate the time. However, we can use the fact that the concentration at the depth of $10^(−3)$ cm is one half the surface concentration to find an expression for $C_0$ in terms of the surface concentration:

$$C(10^(−3) \text{ cm}) = \frac{1}{2}C_0 \implies C_0 = 2C(10^(−3) \text{ cm})$$

Substituting this into the expression for $t$, we get:

$$t = \frac{(10^(−3) \text{ cm})^2(2C(10^(−3) \text{ cm}))}{2(6×10^(−11) \text{ cm}^2 \text{ s}^(−1))} = \frac{(10^(−3) \text{ cm})^2(2C_0)}{2(6×10^(−11) \text{ cm}^2 \text{ s}^(−1))}$$

Substituting the value of $C_0$ in terms of $C(10^(−3) \text{ cm})$, we get:

$$t = \frac{(10^(−3) \text{ cm})^2(2C(10^(−3) \text{ cm}))}{2(6×10^(−1111) \text{ cm}^2 \text{ s}^(−1))} = \frac{(10^(−",,,0,

We are given that D = x * $10^(-13) m^2/s$, D0 = 2* $10^(-5) m^2/s$, and R = 8.314 J/mol.K. We need to find x.

First, let's calculate e^(-Q/RT):

e^(-Q/RT) = e^(-(142,000 J/mol)/(8.314 J/mol.K * T)}

Now, we can find x by solving the equation for D:

x * $10^(-13) m^2/s$ = 2* $10^(-5) m^2/s$ × e^(-(142,000 J/mol)/(8.314 J/mol.K * T))

To find T, we need to take the natural logarithm of both sides and solve for T:

ln(x * $10^(-13) m^2/s$ / (2* $10^(-5) m^2/s$)) = ln(e^(-(142,000 J/mol)/(8.314 J/mol.K * T)))

Using the property of logarithms, we can rewrite the left side as:

ln(x) - ln($10^(-13}$) + ln($10^(-5}$)) = ln(e^(-(142,000 J/mol)/(8.314 J/mol.K * T)))

Now, we can use the fact that ln(e^x) = x to simplify the right side:

ln(x) - ln($10^(-13}$) + ln($10^(-5}$)) = -(142,000 J/mol)/(8.314 J/mol.K * T)

To solve for T, we can first combine the logarithmic terms:

ln(x / ($10^(-13)$ * $10^(-5}$)) = -(142,000 J/mol)/(8.314 J/mol.K * T)

Now, we can isolate T by multiplying both sides by -8.314 J/mol.K and adding 142,000 J/mol to both sides:

T = (142,000 J/mol + 8.314 J/mol.K * ln(x / ($10^(-13)$ * $10^(-5$)))) / 8.314 J/mol.K

Now, we can find the value of x by substituting the given values and solving for T:

T = (142,000 J/mol + 8.314 J/mol.K * ln(x / ($10^(-13)$ * $10^(-5}$))) / 8.314 J/mol.K

727 °C = (142,000 J/mol + 8.314 J/mol.K * ln(x / ($10^(-13)$ * $10^(-5}$))) / 8.314 J/mol.K

x = ($10^(-13)$ * $10^(-5}$ * exp((8.314 J/mol.K * (727 °C - (142,000 J/mol / 8.314 J/mol.K))) / 8.314 J/mol.K)) / $10^(-13}$)

Ni(s) + 2H+(aq) + 2e− → Ni2+(aq) + H2(g)

We are given the standard reduction potential of nickel, E° = −0.25 V, and the concentration of nickel ions in the solution, [Ni2+] = 0.06 M. We need to find the partial pressure of hydrogen, pH2, that makes the potential of the nickel electrode equal to the standard reduction potential.

First, we need to calculate the reduction potential of the nickel electrode in the solution, E, using the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (RT / nF) ln Q

where R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature is in Kelvin, F is Faraday's constant, and n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction. In this case, n = 2.

We are given T = 298 K. To find Q, we need to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution, [H+], from the pH value:

pH = -log10[H+]

[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-4) M

Now, we can calculate the reaction quotient, Q, using the concentrations of nickel ions and hydrogen ions:

Q = [Ni2+]^2 [H+]^2 / [H2]

Since we want to find the partial pressure of hydrogen that makes the potential equal to the standard reduction potential, we set E = E° and solve for pH2:

E = E° - (RT / nF) ln Q

E = -0.25 V = -0.25 × 1.602 × 10^−19 C × 


E = -4.005 × 10^−19 C

Now, we can calculate the reaction quotient:

Q = [Ni2+]^2 [H+]^2 / [H2]

Q = (0.06 M)^2 (10^(-4) M)^2 / pH2

Since we want to find the partial pressure of hydrogen, we need to rearrange the equation to solve for pH2:

pH2 = -(RT / nF) ln [NiNi2+]^2 [H+]^2 / Q

pH2 = -(8.314 J K^−1 mol^−1 × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C mol^−1) ln (0.06 M)^2 (10^(-4) M)^2 / Q

pH2 = -(4.519 × 10^−19 J / C) ln (0.0000032 × Q)

To find the partial pressure of hydrogen, we need to calculate the value of Q:

Q = [Ni2+]^2 [H+]^2 / [H2]

Q = (0.06 M)^2 (10^(-4) M)^2 / (pH2 / (RT / V))

where V is the molar volume of hydrogen gas at standard conditions (22.414 L mol^−1).

We can now solve for pH2 iteratively or numerically to find the value that makes Q equal to 1, indicating that the potential of the nickel electrode is equal to the standard reduction potential. Once we have the value of pH2, we can convert it to the partial pressure of hydrogen using the ideal gas law:

pH2 = xH2 × RT / V

where xH2 is the mole fraction of hydrogen in the gas phase, which can be calculated from the molarity of nickel ions and the molarity of hydrogen ions:

xH2 = [H2] / ([Ni2+] + [H2])

xH2 = (round off to the nearest integer) = 0.",,,0,
Transport phenomena,7,G-XEC-2020-22,NUM,74,Given: Diffusivity of carbon in iron at 1100 °C is 6.0* $10^(-11)m^(2).s^(-1) and erf(z) from the image. A plain carbon steel sample containing 0.1 wt% carbon is undergoing carburization at 1100 ° C in a carbon rich surroundings with fixed carbon content of 1.0 wt% all the time. The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer). ,"To find the time required for carburization, we can use Fick's second law for one-dimensional diffusion:

dC/dt = D * d²C/dz²

where C is the concentration of carbon, D is the diffusivity, t is time, and z is the depth.

First, we need to find the initial and boundary conditions. The initial concentration of carbon in the steel is 0.1 wt%, and the boundary condition is that the carbon concentration at the surface is 1.0 wt%.

We can rewrite Fick's second law as an integral equation:

C(z,t) = C₀(z) + (M/V) * ∫₀^t D * (C(z,t') - C₀(z)) dz'

where C₀(z) is the initial concentration profile, M is the mass of carbon absorbed per unit volume, V is the volume of the steel sample, and the integral is the cumulative amount of carbon diffused into the steel up to time t.

We can simplify this equation by defining the dimensionless variables x = z/d and F = (M/V) * D * t, where d is the thickness of the steel sample. Then, we have:

C(x,F) = C₀(x) + (C(x,0) - C₀(x)) * erf(√(F/d))

where erf(z) is the error function.

We can find the time required to achieve a carbon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm by setting C(x,F) = 0.46 and solving for F:

0.46 = 0.1 + (0.46 - 0.1) * erf(√(F/(5*10^-3)))

Solving for F numerically, we find that F ≈ 1.26. Since D = 6.0*$10^-11 m²s^-1 and d = 5*10^-3 m, we have:

t = D * d² * F / M

We can find M by the molar mass of carbon and the initial weight percentage:

M = (0.1/100) * 12.01 g/mol * 1 kg/1000 g

Plugging in the values, we find that t ≈ 11,500 hours. Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is 11,500 hours.

Therefore, the answer is: [11500]",,,0,
Transport phenomena,8,G-XEC-2021-22,NUM,64,"When a metal (M) is immersed in de-aerated acid electrolyte, it polarizes anodically by 0.4 V. The $M/M^(n+)$ exchange current density is $10^(−5)$ A $m^(−2)$ and Tafel slope is 0.1 V/decade for the anodic reaction. Assume that corrosion is uniform and, anodic and cathodic reactions are under activation control. The rate of metal dissolution in A $m^(−2)$ is? (round off to 1 decimal place)  "," To find the rate of metal dissolution, we need to use the Tafel equation and the given information. The Tafel equation relates the current density (j) to the overpotential (η) as follows:

η = a + b log(j)

where a and b are constants. Rearranging this equation to find j, we get:

j = 10^(b log(η + a))

We are given the overpotential (η = 0.4 V) and the Tafel slope (b = 0.1 V/decade). First, we need to convert the overpotential to volts and convert the Tafel slope to volts per decade.

η = 0.4 V
b = 0.1 V/decade = 0.01 V/mV (since 1 decade = 230 mV)

Now, we can find the current density:

j = 10^(0.01 log(0.4 + a))

To find the value of 'a', we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the potential difference between the electrode and the electrolyte to the logarithm of the activity ratio of the reactants and products. Since the electrolyte is de-aerated, we can assume that the activity of the metal ion (M^(n+)) is equal to its concentration (assuming unit activity for the hydrogen ion).

E = E° + (RT/nF)ln(aM^(n+)/aM)

We are given the standard potential (E° = 0) and the temperature (implicitly given by the Tafel equation). We can assume a reference concentration of 1 M for the metal ion (M) for simplicity.

aM = 1 M

Now, we can find the activity ratio of the metal ion:

aM^(n+) = 10^(-0.4/0.059) = 0.178

Substituting this value into the Nernst equation, we get:

E = (RT/nF)ln(0.178)

Now, we can find the overpotential (η) in terms of the potential difference (E) and the standard potential (E°):

η = E - E°

Since E° = 0, we have:

η = E

Substituting this value into the Tafel equation, we get:

η = 0.4 = a + b log(j)

Solving for j, we get:

j = 10^(0.01 log(0.4 + a))

We can approximate a as the Nernst potential (E/n) since the Tafel slope is small:

a = E/n = 0.4/1 = 0.4 V/1 = 0.4 V

Substituting this value into the Tafel equation, we get:

j = 10^(0.01 log(0.4 + 0.4))

j = 10^(0.01 log(0.8))

j = 10^(0.0035)

j = 1.53 A/m^2 (rounded to one decimal place)

Therefore, the rate of metal dissolution is approximately 1.53 A/m^2.",,,0,

Fick's second law: J = -D * dC/dx

where J is the flux, D is the diffusivity, and dC/dx is the concentration gradient.

Given that the concentration gradient is constant and equal to -C0/(10 μm), we can rearrange Fick's second law to find the time it takes for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm:

t = (xD^2) / (2 * D)

where x is the diffusion depth and D is the diffusivity.

First, we need to find the diffusivity at 600 K:

D(600 K) = $(D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_(B)T})$

D(600 K) = $(D_A)°*exp(-{0.3 eV / (8.62*10^{-5} eV/K * 600 K)})$

t = (xD^2) / (2 * D)

t = (10 μm^2) / (2 * D(600 K))

t = (10*10^-12 m^2) / (2 * D(600 K))

t = (10*10^-12 m^2) / (2 * $(D_A)°*exp(-{0.000315 * 10^{19} / 1.131*10^{-18}})$)

t = (10*10^-12 m^2) / (2 * $(D_A)°*1.23*10^{-6})$

t = (L^2) / (D)

where L is the length of the alloy sample, and D is the diffusivity.

First, we need to find the ratio of diffusivities at the two temperatures:

(D_(1373K)) / (D_(1273K)) = (10^(-18)) / (10^(-19)) = 10^(1) = 10

Since the length of the alloy sample is the same at both temperatures, the time required for homogenization at 1373 K is:

t = (L^2) / (D_(1373K)) = (L^2) / (10^(-18)) = 10^18 * L^2

At 300°C and $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd in $mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd is? (answer up to one decimal place)","To find the solubility of hydrogen in Pd at a given partial pressure, we can use Henry's law, which relates the solubility of a gas in a liquid to its partial pressure. Henry's law states that the solubility (S) of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to its partial pressure (P) at a constant temperature:

S = KH * P

where KH is the Henry's law constant.

First, we need to find the Henry's law constant for hydrogen in Pd at 3000°C. We can use the given data at 300°C and 1 atm to find the Henry's law constant using the following equation:

ln(S/m) = ln(KH) + ln(P)

where S/m is the solubility in mol/m^3, P is the partial pressure in atm, and KH is the Henry's law constant in mol/(m^3*atm).

At 300°C and 1 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd is 1.1.64 * 10^(4) mm^3(STP)/kg = 1.64 * 10^(4) * (0.022414 * 22.414 * 29.921) / (1000 * 1) = 1.21 * 10^(-3) mol/m^3.

Using this value, we can find the Henry's law constant as follows:

ln(1.21 * 10^(-3)) = ln(KH) + ln(1)
ln(1.21 * 10^(-3)) = ln(KH)
KH = 1.21 * 10^(-3)

Now, we can use this constant to find the solubility at a partial pressure of 0.09 atm:

S = KH * P
S = 1.21 * 10^(-3) * 0.09
S = 1.09 * 10^(-4} mol/m^3

To convert this value to $mm^3$(STP)/kg, we can use the ideal gas law:

PV = nRT

where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

At STP conditions, P = 1 atm, V = 22.414 L, and T = 273.15 K.

First, we need to find the number of moles of hydrogen in $mm^3$(STP):

n = S / (RT/V)
n = (1.09 * 10^(-4}) / ((0.08206 * 273.15) / 22.414)
n = 2.15 * 10^(-6} mol

Now, we can find the volume in L:

V = n * (RT/P)
V = 2.15 * 10^(-6} * ((0.08206 * 273.15) / 1)
V = 1.12 * 10^(-3} L

Finally, we can convert this volume to $mm^3$:

V = 1.12 * 10^(-3} * (1000 * 1000 * 1000)
V = 1.12 * 10^(6} mm^3

A copper-aluminium diffusion couple develops a certain concentration profile after an isothermal treatment at 600°C for 10 hours. The time(in hours to 1 decimal place) required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is,"To find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C, we can use the following relationship between the relationship between the interdiffusion coefficient and diffusion coefficient:

D = (x1 × D1 + x2 × D2) / (x1 + x2)

where D is the interdiffusion coefficient, D1 and D2 are the diffusion coefficients of components 1 and 2, x1 and x2 are their mole fractions.

First, we need to find the diffusion coefficients of copper in aluminium at 500°C using the given interdiffusion coefficient and the mole fractions of copper and aluminium.

Let's assume the mole fraction of copper in the diffusion couple is x1 and the mole fraction of aluminium is x2 = 1 - x1.

At 500°C, the diffusion coefficient of copper is Do. We can use the given interdiffusion coefficients at 500°C and 600°C to find Do:

Do = (x1 × D600 + x2 × Di500) / (x1 + x2)

where Di500 is the diffusion coefficient of copper in aluminium at 500°C.

We are given Di600 = 8 * $10^(-13)m^(2)s^(-1)$ and x1 = 0.5 (since the problem states that the interdiffusion coefficient is for copper in aluminium).

To find Di500, we can rearrange the equation:

Di500 = [(Do × (1 - x1) - x1 × D600] / [x1]

Di500 = [(Do × 0.5 - 0.5 × 8 * $10^(-13)] / 0.5

Di500 = Do - 4 * $10^(-14)

Now that we have the diffusion coefficient of copper in aluminium at 500°C, we can use Fick's second law to find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile:

J = -D × (dc/dx)

where J is the flux, dc/dx is the concentration gradient, and D is the diffusion coefficient.

The concentration gradient can be related to the concentration profile using the following relationship:

dc/dc/dcx = -(Cf - Ci) / (L/2)

where Cf is the final concentration, Ci is the initial concentration, and L is the thickness of the diffusion couple.

We are given that the concentration profile after 10 hours at 600°C is the same as the one we want to find at 500°C. Let's call this final concentration Cf.

We don't know the initial concentration Ci, but we can assume it to be zero for simplicity (since the problem doesn't provide any information about it).

We can rearrange the equation to find the concentration gradient:

(dc/dx) = -(Cf) / (L/2)

Now we can use Fick's second law to find the flux:

J = -D × (dc/dx) = D × (Cf / (L/2))

The flux is related to the mass transfer rate (M) by the following relationship:

M = J × A

where A is the area of the diffusion couple.

We can rearrange this equation to find the time required to transfer a certain mass:

t = M / (J × A)

We are not given the mass transfer rate M, but we can relate it to the concentration profile using the following relationship:

M = (m / (ρ × A)) × (Δm / (ΔV))

where m is the mass of copper in the diffusion couple, ρ is the density of the copper-aluminium alloy, Δm is the change in mass of copper, and ΔV is the volume of the diffusion couple.

We can assume that the change in mass of copper is proportional to the volume of the diffusion couple, since the concentration profile is the same at both temperatures. Let's call the volume of the diffusion couple V.

We can rearrange the equation to find Δm:

Δm = M × (ΔV / (ρ × A))

Assume [$h_N$]= [wt.%N], where [$h_N$] N h is the activity of nitrogen with respect to 1 wt.% Henrian standard state. Equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen (in wt.%, rounded off to three decimal places) in pure liquid iron, exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K, is?"," To find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron at 1873 K, we need to use Sieverts' law and the given expression for the logarithm of the equilibrium constant.

First, we need to find the value of the equilibrium constant $K_n$ at 1873 K:

$log_{10}K_n = -\frac{518}{T} - 1.063$

$log_{10}K_n = -\frac{518}{1873} - 1.063$

$log_{10}K_n = -0.273 - 1.063$

$log_{10}K_n = -1.336$

$K_n = 10^{-1.336}$

$K_n = 0.0495$

Now, we can use Sieverts' law to find the equilibrium concentration of nitrogen:

$h_N = K_n \sqrt{p_{N,gas}}$

where $p_{N,gas}$ is the partial pressure of nitrogen in atmospheric air.

At 1873 K and 1 atm total pressure, the partial pressure of nitrogen is approximately 0.79 x 1 atm = 0.79 atm (since the composition of air is approximately 79% nitrogen by volume).

$h_N = 0.0495 \sqrt{0.79}$

$h_N = 0.0495 \times 0.894$

$h_N = 0.0431$

To find the weight percentage of nitrogen in the liquid iron, we need to convert the activity to weight percentage using the given relation:

$h_N = \frac{[h_N]}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}[h_i]}$

where $[h_i]$ is the activity of the $i$-th component in the solution. Since we are only considering nitrogen, we have:

$h_N = \frac{[h_N]}{1 + [h_N]}$

$[h_N] = \frac{h_N}{1 - h_N}$

$[h_N] = \frac{0.0431}{1 - 0.0431}$

$[h_N] = 0.0463$

To find the weight percentage of nitrogen, we can use the relation:

$[h_N] = \frac{m_{N,dissolved}}{m_{Fe,total}}$

where $m_{N,dissolved}$ is the mass of dissolved nitrogen and $m_{Fe,total}$ is the total mass of iron.

Since we are given the activity of nitrogen, we can find the mass of dissolved nitrogen and then convert it to weight percentage.

$m_{N,dissolved} = [h_N] \times m_{Fe,total}$

$m_{N,dissolved} = 0.0463 \times m_{Fe,total}$

To find the weight percentage of nitrogen, we need to know the mass of the iron. Let's assume a mass of 1 kg for simplicity:

$m_{N,dissolved} = 0.0463 \times 1$

$m_{N,dissolved} = 0.0463$ kg

$[wt.\%]_{N,dissolved} = \frac{m_{N,dissolved}}{m_{Fe,total}} \times 100\%$

$[wt.\%]_{N,dissolved} = \frac{0.0463}{1} \times 100\%$

$[wt.\%]_{N,dissolved} = 4.63\%$

Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron, exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K, is approximately 4.63 wt.%.",,,0,

If 200g of weight is lost over a period of 10 years, then the corrosion rate($kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$) is?(round off to the nearest integer)","To find the corrosion rate, we can use the given formula:

CPR = KW/pAt

where W is the weight loss per unit time, t is the time, p is the density of the metal, A is the exposed surface area, and K is a constant.

First, we need to find the weight loss per year:

Weight loss per year = Total weight loss / Time
Weight loss per year = 200g / 10 yrs
Weight loss per year = 20g

Now, we can find the corrosion rate using the given formula:

Corrosion rate = CPR = KW/pAt

We are given the weight loss per year (W), the exposed surface area (A), and the time (t). We need to find the density of iron (p) and the constant K.

The density of iron is 7870 kg/m³.

To find the constant K, we need to know the units of CPR. Since the units of CPR are kg.m²/year, we can use the given factor of 534 for CPR in mils per year (mpy) to convert to kg.m²/year.

K = 534 mpy × 0.0000254 m²/mpy
K = 1.36 × 10⁻⁵ kg.m²/year.mil

Now, we can find the corrosion rate:

Corrosion rate = CPR = KW/pAt
Corrosion rate = (1.36 × 10⁻⁵ kg.m²/year.mil) × (20g) / (50,000 cm²) × (1 yr)
Corrosion rate = 2.72 × 10⁻⁶ kg.m²/year

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is:

Answer: [2]

However, this answer is very small and may not be practically significant. In industrial applications, corrosion rates are usually reported in mills or mils per year (mpy), so it is more common to express the answer in this unit. To convert the answer to mpy, we can use the given conversion factor:

1 mpy = 0.0000254 kg.m²/year

So, the corrosion rate is:

Corrosion rate = 2.72 × 10⁻⁶ kg.m²/year × (1 / 0.0000254 kg.m²/year)
Corrosion rate = 1.07 × 10⁴ mpy

dC/dx = 2ax + a2

Now, we can use the definition of flux J as the product of the concentration and the diffusion coefficient:

J = -D * dCdx

Substituting the expression for dCdx, we get:

J = -D * (2ax + a2)

At x = 2 mm, we have:

J = -3 * 10^(-3) * (2*2*1 + 1) = -3 * 10^(-3) * (5) = -1.5 * 10^(-2) atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1)

To find the magnitude of the flux at x = 2 mm, we take the absolute value:

|J| = 1.5 * 10^(-2) atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1)

Now, we need to find the value of y such that:

|J| = y * 10^(-3) atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1)

Setting both sides equal to each other and solving for y, we get:

y = |J| / 10^(-3) = 1.5 / 0.001 = 1500

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is 1501.

However, it seems there is an error in the problem statement as the units of y are not consistent with the given units of the diffusion coefficient and the concentration.

H = Hc = 7000 A/m

Next, we need to calculate the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid when it is carrying a certain current. The magnetic field strength inside a solenoid can be calculated using the formula:

Since we want to generate a magnetic field strength equal to the coercivity of the magnet, we can set B = H:

I = H * L / (μ0 * Ni)

Substituting the given values:

I = 7000 A/m * 0.25 m / (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 150)

The magnetic moment of an electron in a Bohr magneton ($µ_B$) is given by:

$µ_B = \frac{e \hbar}{2m_e}$

Density of iron = 7870 kg/m^3

Number of iron atoms = (2 x 55.85 g/mol) / (7870 kg/m^3)
Number of iron atoms = 0.00856 x 10^24/m^3

3. Find the number of iron atoms in a unit volume:
Number of iron atoms in a unit volume = Number of iron atoms/m^3
Number of iron atoms in a unit volume = 0.00856 x 10^24/m^3

4. Find the magnetic moment per iron atom:
Magnetic moment per iron atom = (Saturation magnetization) / (Number of iron atoms in a unit volume)
Magnetic moment per iron atom = 1700 x 10^3 A/m / (0.00856 x 10^24/m^3)

Magnetic moment per iron atom = 2.01 x 10^-23 J/T

To convert J/T to Am^2, we need to use the conversion factor:
1 J/T = 10^7 Am^2

Magnetic moment per iron atom = 2.01 x 10^-23 J/T x 10^7 Am^2/J/T
Magnetic moment per iron atom = 2.01 x 10^-16 Am^2

So, the magnetic moment per iron atom is approximately 2.01 x 10^-16 Am^2.",,,0,

Explanation: Microstrain can be measured by X-ray diffraction by analyzing the broadening of the diffraction peaks. The broadening of the peaks is caused by the slight changes in the interatomic spacing due to the presence of microstrain. By measuring the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks and comparing it to the expected peak width for a perfect crystal, the magnitude of the microstrain can be determined. This is because the FWHM is directly related to the crystallite size and strain. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.",,,0,

The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball.

However, before that, we need to find the viscosity of liquid Al in SI units.

Given: $μ_(Al)$ = 1*$10^(–3)$ Pa.s = 1*$10^(–3)$ Ns/m$^2$

To convert Pa.s to Ns/m$^2$, we have:

1 Pa.s = 1 Ns/m$^2$

So, $μ_(Al)$ = 1*$10^(–3)$ Ns/m$^2$

Now, we can use Stokes' law to find the terminal velocity:

Terminal velocity (v) = ($2$ * $ρ_(steel)$ * $g$ * $d\_p$) / ($9$ * $μ_(Al)$)

Where, $ρ_(steel)$ = 7200 kg/m$^3$, $g$ = 9.81 m/s$^2$, and $d\_p$ is the diameter of the steel particle in meters.

Let's convert $d\_p$ from µm to meters:

$d\_p$ = 50 µm = 0.00005 m

Substituting the values, we get:

$v$ = ($2$ * $7200$ * $9.81$ * $0.00005$) / ($9$ * $1*10^(–3)$)

$v$ = 6.6*$10^5$ * $0.00005^2$ m/s$^2$

At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is","To find the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle, we can use the continuity equation and the nozzle discharge coefficient. The continuity equation states that the mass flow rate is equal to the product of the density and the cross-sectional area of the nozzle times the velocity. The nozzle discharge coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that represents the efficiency of the nozzle in converting the pressure energy of the fluid into kinetic energy.

First, we need to find the cross-sectional area of the nozzle. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where r is the radius. Since the nozzle diameter is given as 30 mm, the radius is half of that: r = 30 mm / 2 = 0.015 m.

Now we can calculate the initial mass flow rate:

ρ = 7000 kg.$m^(-3)$
D = 30 mm = 0.03 m
Cd = 0.80

A = πr² = π(0.015)² = 0.00017672 m²

The velocity of the liquid metal as it leaves the nozzle can be calculated using Bernoulli's equation, which relates the pressure and velocity of a fluid at two points. Since we are neglecting frictional losses, the pressure at the nozzle exit is assumed to be atmospheric, and the pressure at the surface of the liquid metal in the vessel is given by the height of the column and the liquid metal density.

h = 3.2 m

p₀ = ρgh = 7000 kg.$m^(-3)$ × 9.81 m.$s^(-2)$ × 3.2 m = 226,176 Pa

v = √31.05 m.$s^(-2)$ = 5.56 m.$s^(-1)$

We can see that pressure, velocity, and density have the same dimensions as mass times length raised to some power and time raised to some power. Therefore, we can form a dimensionless variable by dividing pressure by the product of density and size raised to some power: Pi = P/ρL^n

We can also form a dimensionless variable by dividing velocity by the size: Pi = V/L

Now, we can use the energy conservation equation to find the velocity of the liquid metal at the gate:

mgh = (1/2)mv²

mgh = (1/2)ρVv²

v² = 2gh

v² = 2 × 9.8 m/s² × 0.5 m = 4.9 m/s²

v = √4.9 m/s² = 2.2 m/s (rounded to nearest integer)

Explanation:

The shear stress is defined as the partial derivative of the pressure with respect to the radial distance, multiplied by the fluid viscosity and the radial distance: τ = -∂p/∂r * µ * r.

Given the equation of motion for the axial velocity, we can find the pressure gradient as ∂p/∂z = ΔP/L. Since the flow is fully developed and 1-D, the pressure gradient is constant and independent of the radial distance. Therefore, the shear stress on the tube wall is given by:

τ = -∂p/∂r * µ * r = (-ΔP/L) * µ * r = ΔPr/L.

So, the answer is (B) ΔPr/L.",,,0,

(Note: B is the center of the sphere and the straight horizontal line OAB intersects the surface of the sphere at the point A.)

Explanation:

In an inviscid, incompressible fluid, the flow around a non-rotating, smooth spherical object is described by Bernoulli's equation, which states that the pressure decreases as the velocity increases along a streamline. Since the flow is steady and fully developed far from the object, the velocity of the fluid must be lower on the sides of the sphere compared to the velocity at the center of the streamline OA. This results in a pressure decrease on the sides of the sphere, causing the flow to be deflected round the object.

Statement (A) is incorrect because the velocity of the fluid at point A is not necessarily zero. Statement (B) is also incorrect because the fluid pressure at point A does not exceed that at point O by the amount 𝜌$v^2$/2, as the pressure difference is due to the velocity difference, not the velocity squared. Statement (C) is partially correct, but it is not complete because the fluid does not turn perpendicular to OA at a single point, but rather over a curved path as it flows around the sphere.",,,0,

Ladle deoxidation of liquid steel is done at 1600°C by adding ferro-aluminium. By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?"," To calculate the time required for alumina particles to float to the surface using Stokes' law, we can use the following equation:

t = (2 * ρ * r^2) / (9 * μ * C)

where:
- ρ is the density of the fluid (steel in this case)
- r is the radius of the particle (alumina in this case)
- μ is the viscosity of the fluid (steel in this case)
- C is the drag coefficient (assumed to be 0.5 for spherical particles according to Stokes' law)

First, we need to find the density difference between steel and alumina:

Δρ = ρsteel - ρalumina = 7000 kg/m³ - 3650 kg/m³ = 3350 kg/m³

Next, we can calculate the radius of the alumina particle:

r = d / 2 = 50 µm / 2 = 25 µm = 2.5 × 10⁻⁶ m

Now, we can calculate the time required for the alumina particle to float to the surface:

t = (2 * Δρ * r²) / (9 * μ * C)

t = (2 * 3350 kg/m³ * (2.5 × 10⁻⁶ m)²) / (9 * 6 × 10⁻³ kg/m/s * 0.5)

The terminal velocity(in mm$s^(-1)$ to two decimal places) (𝑣) of a spherical inclusion of diameter D = 50 micrometers rising in liquid steel is?","To find the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion, we can use Stokes' law:

$F\_d = 3\pi\eta v$

where $F\_d$ is the drag force, $\eta$ is the viscosity, and $v$ is the terminal velocity.

First, we need to find the volume and mass of the inclusion:

Volume: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(0.00005m)³ = 1.331\times10^{-12}m³$
Mass: $m = \rho V = 1.331\times10^{-12}kg$

Next, we can calculate the terminal velocity using Stokes' law:

$F\_d = m\times g = \rho V\times g = 1.331\times10^{-12}kg\times9.8m/s² = 1.303\times10^{-11}N$

$v = \frac{F\_d}{3\pi\eta} = \frac{1.303\times10^{-11}N}{3\pi\times0.0000079Pa\cdot s} = 1.51\times10^{-4}m/s$

To convert the terminal velocity to mm/s, we multiply by 1000:

$1.51\times10^{-4}m/s\times1000 = 1510mm/s$

So, the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion is approximately 1510 mm/s.

dmdt = kx^2

where dmdt is the rate of change of mass gain in oxide per unit area, k is the parabolic rate constant, and x is the thickness of the oxide film.

First, we need to convert the thickness of 2 µm to units of cm:

2 µm = 2 * 10^-6 cm

dmdt = kx^2
m/s = 3 * 10^-6 g^2.cm^-4.s^-1 * (2 * 10^-6 cm)^2

Solving for time (t):

t = (m/s) / (k * x^2)
t = (1) / (3 * 10^-6 g^2.cm^-4.s^-1 * (2 * 10^-6 cm)^2)
t = 1 / (3 * 10^-6 g^2.cm^-4.s^-1 * 4 * 10^-12 cm^2)
