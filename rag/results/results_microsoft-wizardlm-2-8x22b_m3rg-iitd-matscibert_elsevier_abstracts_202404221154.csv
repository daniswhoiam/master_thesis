(A) Calendering (B) Czochralski (C) Float zone (D) Bridgman," To answer the question, we need to identify which of the listed techniques is not used for growing single crystals of semiconductors. Let's briefly describe each technique:

(A) Calendering: This is a process used in various industries, including paper and plastics, to smooth out and compress materials. It is not a method used for growing single crystals.

(B) Czochralski: This is a well-known method for growing single crystals, particularly for semiconductors like silicon. It involves dipping a seed crystal into molten semiconductor material and slowly pulling it up to form a single crystal ingot.

(C) Float Zone: This is another technique used for purifying and growing semiconductor crystals. It involves passing a molten zone through a rod of the material, which leaves behind a purer, single-crystal material.

(D) Bridgman: This is a crystal growth technique where a crucible containing the semiconductor material is slowly moved from a hot to a cold zone in a furnace, causing the material to solidify into a single crystal.

Elastic scattering refers to the interaction between the incident electrons and the atoms in the material where there is no loss of energy by the incident electrons, but they are deflected from their original path. Backscattered electrons are those incident electrons that are scattered back out of the material after such elastic collisions with the nuclei of the atoms in the material.

Thermodynamics,2,G-XEC-2012-6,MCQS,49,"Of the following materials, which is the most suitable for an LED emitting at around 380 nm?  (A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap (B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap (C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap (D) Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap "," To determine the most suitable material for an LED emitting at around 380 nm, we need to consider the bandgap energy of the materials. The wavelength of light emitted by an LED is inversely related to the bandgap energy of the semiconductor material used in the LED. The energy of the emitted photon (E) is given by the equation:

\[ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy of the photon,
- \( h \) is Planck's constant,
- \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, and
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the emitted light.

For an LED emitting at 380 nm (in the ultraviolet range), we need a material with a bandgap that corresponds to this wavelength.

Here's a breakdown of the options:

(A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap: Direct bandgap materials are generally more efficient for LEDs because the transition of electrons from the conduction band to the valence band (recombination) can occur directly without the need for a phonon (lattice vibration). However, a ""small bandgap"" would correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy), not suitable for 380 nm emission.

(B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap: Indirect bandgap materials have a lower probability of radiative recombination because they require a change in momentum that typically involves a phonon. This makes them less efficient for LED applications. Additionally, a ""large bandgap"" would correspond to shorter wavelengths (higher energy) than needed for 380 nm emission.

(C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap: This type of material would be suitable for emitting shorter wavelengths, such as ultraviolet light at 380 nm. The direct bandgap ensures efficient radiative recombination, and the large bandgap corresponds to the high energy required for short-wavelength emission.

(D) Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap: This would be the least suitable option because it combines the inefficiency of an indirect bandgap with a bandgap that is too small to emit at 380 nm.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

- [ ] (A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap
- [ ] (B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap
- [x] (C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap

Thermodynamics,4,G-XEC-2013-15,NUM,29,"The band gap of a semiconducting material used to make an LED is 1.43 eV. What will be the minimum wavelength ofthe radiation emitted by this LED, in μm?"," To find the minimum wavelength of the radiation emitted by an LED, we can use the relationship between energy and wavelength given by the equation:

\[ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy of the photon (in eV),
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s),
- \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the photon (in meters).

First, we need to convert the energy from eV to Joules to match the units of Planck's constant and the speed of light. The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

\[ E_{J} = E_{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} \]
\[ E_{J} = 1.43 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} \]
\[ E_{J} = 2.29166 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \]

Now we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{J}} \]
\[ \lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{2.29166 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \]
\[ \lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m/s}}{2.29166 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \]
\[ \lambda = 8.674 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \]

To convert the wavelength from meters to micrometers (μm), we use the conversion factor 1 m = 10^6 μm:

\[ \lambda_{\mu m} = 8.674 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \times 10^6 \, \mu\text{m/m} \]
\[ \lambda_{\mu m} = 0.8674 \, \mu\text{m} \]

Therefore, the minimum wavelength of the radiation emitted by this LED, in micrometers, is approximately 0.8674 μm.

(D) minority carrier concentration much less than majority carrier concentration

At low injection levels in a forward-biased p-n junction, the majority carrier concentration remains relatively constant and much higher than the minority carrier concentration. The minority carrier concentration does increase due to the injection of carriers from the p-side to the n-side and vice versa, but it remains much less than the majority carrier concentration. This is because the injection levels are low, and thus the equilibrium carrier concentrations are not significantly altered.

If 100 g of water that is at 90 °C is added to the cup, the final temperature of water in °C is"," To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The heat lost by the hot water will be equal to the heat gained by the cold water and the copper cup.

Let's denote the final equilibrium temperature as \( T_f \).

The heat lost by the hot water is given by:
\[ Q_{hot} = m_{hot} \cdot c_{water} \cdot (T_{hot} - T_f) \]
where:
- \( m_{hot} \) is the mass of the hot water (100 g)
- \( c_{water} \) is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g°C)
- \( T_{hot} \) is the initial temperature of the hot water (90°C)

The heat gained by the cold water in the cup is given by:
\[ Q_{cold} = m_{cold} \cdot c_{water} \cdot (T_f - T_{cold}) \]
where:
- \( m_{cold} \) is the mass of the cold water (80 g)
- \( T_{cold} \) is the initial temperature of the cold water (4°C)

The heat gained by the copper cup is given by:
\[ Q_{cup} = m_{cup} \cdot c_{copper} \cdot (T_f - T_{cold}) \]
where:
- \( m_{cup} \) is the mass of the copper cup (140 g)
- \( c_{copper} \) is the specific heat capacity of copper (0.385 J/g°C)

Since the heat lost by the hot water is equal to the total heat gained by the cold water and the copper cup, we can write:
\[ Q_{hot} = Q_{cold} + Q_{cup} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ 100 \cdot 4.18 \cdot (90 - T_f) = 80 \cdot 4.18 \cdot (T_f - 4) + 140 \cdot 0.385 \cdot (T_f - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( T_f \):
\[ 418 \cdot (90 - T_f) = 334.4 \cdot (T_f - 4) + 53.9 \cdot (T_f - 4) \]
\[ 37620 - 418T_f = 334.4T_f - 1337.6 + 53.9T_f - 215.6 \]
\[ 37620 - 418T_f = 388.3T_f - 1553.2 \]
\[ 37620 + 1553.2 = 388.3T_f + 418T_f \]
\[ 39173.2 = 806.3T_f \]
\[ T_f = \frac{39173.2}{806.3} \]
\[ T_f \approx 48.6 °C \]

So the final temperature of the water in the cup will be approximately 48.6 °C.

The energy of a photon emitted when an electron transitions from a higher energy level \( n_i \) to a lower energy level \( n_f \) in a hydrogen atom is given by the difference in energy between the two levels:

\[ E = E_{n_i} - E_{n_f} \]

The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the formula:

\[ E_n = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2} \]

where \( n \) is the principal quantum number.

For the transition from \( n = 4 \) to \( n = 2 \), the energy of the emitted photon is:

\[ E = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{4^2} - \left(-\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{2^2}\right) \]
\[ E = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{16} + \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{4} \]
\[ E = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{16} + \frac{4 \times 13.6 \text{ eV}}{16} \]
\[ E = \frac{3 \times 13.6 \text{ eV}}{16} \]
\[ E = \frac{40.8 \text{ eV}}{16} \]
\[ E = 2.55 \text{ eV} \]

Now, to find the wavelength \( \lambda \) of the photon, we use the Planck-Einstein relation:

\[ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light. Rearranging for \( \lambda \), we get:

(A) the potential energy of the solid is lowest

At the equilibrium distance in a solid, the atoms are at a position where the net force on them is zero, which means the forces of attraction and repulsion are balanced. This balance results in the lowest potential energy for the solid, as any deviation from this distance would require energy to either bring the atoms closer or push them apart against the interatomic forces.

The conductivity (σ) of an intrinsic semiconductor can be expressed as:

σ = n * e * μ

where:
- n is the carrier concentration (number of electrons or holes per unit volume),
- e is the elementary charge (charge of an electron),
- μ is the mobility of the charge carriers.

The carrier concentration n in an intrinsic semiconductor is given by:

n = n_i^2 = N_C * N_V * exp(-E_g/(kT))

where:
- n_i is the intrinsic carrier concentration,
- N_C and N_V are the effective density of states for the conduction band and valence band, respectively,

- k is the Boltzmann constant,
- T is the absolute temperature.

Taking the natural logarithm of n, we get:

Since the natural logarithm of the product is the sum of the natural logarithms, and the natural logarithm of a constant is also a constant, we can write:

ln(n) = constant - E_g/(kT)

Now, if we plot log_e(conductivity) versus 1/T, the slope of this graph will be given by the coefficient of the 1/T term, which is:

Calculate the original length of the iron rail track in cm. (linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$)"," To solve this problem, we can use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[ \Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T \]

- \( \Delta L \) is the change in length,
- \( \alpha \) is the linear thermal expansion coefficient,
- \( L_0 \) is the original length of the material,
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

Given:
- \( \Delta L = 0.05 \) cm (the increase in length),
- \( \alpha = 11.0 \times 10^{-6} \) \( K^{-1} \) (the linear thermal expansion coefficient for iron),
- \( \Delta T = 45°C - 15°C = 30°C \) or \( 30 \) K (since the change in temperature is the same in Celsius and Kelvin).

The band gap of silicon is 1.1 eV.," To determine the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated by a silicon detector irradiated by an x-ray photon with an energy of 1.54 keV, we can use the following approach:

1. Convert the energy of the x-ray photon from keV to eV, since the band gap energy is given in eV:
   1.54 keV = 1540 eV (since 1 keV = 1000 eV)

2. Divide the energy of the x-ray photon by the band gap energy of silicon to find the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated:
   Number of electron-hole pairs = Energy of x-ray photon (eV) / Band gap energy of silicon (eV)
   Number of electron-hole pairs = 1540 eV / 1.1 eV

3. Since the actual generation of electron-hole pairs involves some energy loss mechanisms (like phonon creation and non-radiative recombination), the actual number of pairs generated will be less than the theoretical maximum calculated above. However, for the purpose of this question, we will consider the theoretical maximum.

4. Perform the division to find the theoretical maximum number of electron-hole pairs:
   Number of electron-hole pairs = 1540 / 1.1 ≈ 1400

5. In practice, the average energy required to generate an electron-hole pair in silicon is about 3.6 eV due to the aforementioned energy loss mechanisms. This value is known as the pair creation energy. Therefore, a more realistic estimate would be:
   Number of electron-hole pairs (realistic) = Energy of x-ray photon (eV) / Pair creation energy
   Number of electron-hole pairs (realistic) = 1540 eV / 3.6 eV

6. Calculate the realistic number of electron-hole pairs:
   Number of electron-hole pairs (realistic) ≈ 427.78

Since we are looking for the maximum number of electron-hole pairs, we will consider the theoretical maximum, which is based on the band gap energy alone, without considering the energy loss mechanisms.

Therefore, the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated is approximately 1400. However, for a more realistic estimate, the number would be around 428.

Here is the final answer in a list, as requested:

- Maximum theoretical number of electron-hole pairs: 1400

\[ \lambda = \frac{h c}{E_g} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s} \times 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{2.88 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}} \]
\[ \lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J m}}{2.88 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}} \]
\[ \lambda = 6.902 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} \]

Since 1 Å (angstrom) is \( 10^{-10} \) meters, we convert the wavelength to Å:

\[ \lambda = 6.902 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} \times \frac{10^{10} \text{ Å}}{1 \text{ m}} \]
\[ \lambda = 6902 \text{ Å} \]

Therefore, the threshold value of the wavelength below which this material will absorb radiation is approximately:

(C) at all intensities, as long as the wavelength of the incident radiation is below a threshold value.

The photoelectric effect describes the phenomenon where electrons are ejected from a material when it is exposed to light (or more generally, electromagnetic radiation). However, this does not happen at all wavelengths. There is a specific threshold wavelength (related to the material's work function) below which the photoelectric effect occurs. If the wavelength is longer than this threshold (i.e., the frequency is lower than the threshold frequency), no electrons will be ejected, regardless of the intensity of the light. Once the threshold wavelength is surpassed (or, equivalently, the threshold frequency is reached or exceeded), electrons can be ejected, and the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons will depend on the frequency of the incident light, not its intensity. The intensity of the light affects the rate at which electrons are ejected, but not their kinetic energy.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- [(C) at all intensities, as long as the wavelength of the incident radiation is below a threshold value.]",,,0,

(D) A photon is created in the process.," When an electron makes a transition from the valence band to the conduction band in an indirect band gap semiconductor, it is moving from a lower energy state to a higher energy state. This process requires an input of energy. The correct statements regarding this transition are:

- (A) Energy of the electron increases (not decreases as the transition is from a lower to a higher energy state).
- (C) A phonon is annihilated in the process because the electron requires not just the energy from the photon but also energy from lattice vibrations (phonons) to make the transition across the indirect band gap. The annihilation of a phonon effectively contributes the necessary momentum for the transition since the conservation of momentum must be satisfied in an indirect band gap semiconductor.

Therefore, the correct answers are:

- (A) Energy of the electron increases.
- (C) A phonon is annihilated in the process.

The other options are incorrect because:

- (B) A photon is not emitted in the process; rather, the electron absorbs energy from a photon to make the transition.
- (D) A photon is not created in the process; instead, a photon may be absorbed, and its energy combined with the energy from a phonon allows the electron to transition to the conduction band.

Thermodynamics,20,G-XEC-2018-18,NUM,42,"When 3 identical non-interacting spin ½ particles are put in an infinite potential well, the ground state energy of the system is 18 meV. If instead, seven particles are put inside the potential well, the new ground state energy in meV is?"," To solve this problem, we need to understand the quantum mechanical behavior of particles in an infinite potential well and how the energy levels are populated according to the Pauli exclusion principle for spin-½ particles (fermions).

For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by:

\[ E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \]

where:
- \( E_n \) is the energy of the \( n \)-th level,
- \( n \) is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...),
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant,
- \( m \) is the mass of the particle,
- \( L \) is the width of the well.

For three identical non-interacting spin-½ particles, the ground state would have the three lowest energy levels filled, with two particles in the lowest level (due to the two possible spin states) and one particle in the next level. The third particle cannot occupy the same state as the first two due to the Pauli exclusion principle.

If the ground state energy for three particles is 18 meV, we can infer that the energy levels are filled as follows:
- The lowest level (n=1) has an energy of \( E_1 \), and two particles are in this level.
- The second level (n=2) has an energy of \( E_2 = 4E_1 \) (since energy is proportional to \( n^2 \)), and one particle is in this level.

The total energy for the system of three particles is:

\[ E_{total} = 2E_1 + E_2 = 2E_1 + 4E_1 = 6E_1 \]

Given that \( E_{total} = 18 \) meV, we can solve for \( E_1 \):

\[ 6E_1 = 18 \text{ meV} \]
\[ E_1 = 3 \text{ meV} \]

Now, for seven particles, we would fill the energy levels up to \( n=4 \), with two particles in each of the first two levels and one particle in each of the third and fourth levels:

\[ E_{total,7} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 + E_4 \]
\[ E_{total,7} = 2(3 \text{ meV}) + 2(4 \times 3 \text{ meV}) + (3^2 \times 3 \text{ meV}) + (4^2 \times 3 \text{ meV}) \]
\[ E_{total,7} = 6 \text{ meV} + 24 \text{ meV} + 27 \text{ meV} + 48 \text{ meV} \]
\[ E_{total,7} = 105 \text{ meV} \]

Therefore, the new ground state energy for seven particles in the potential well is 105 meV.

Mild steel is carburized at 1300 K for 1 hour to obtain a certain case depth. Keeping the time as 1 hour, the case depth can be doubled by increasing the temperature to what temperature(in K)? (round off to the nearest whole number)"," To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant \( k \) of a reaction to the temperature \( T \) and the activation energy \( Q \):

\[ k = A \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT}\right) \]

where:
- \( A \) is the pre-exponential factor (frequency of correctly oriented collisions),
- \( R \) is the gas constant,
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
- \( Q \) is the activation energy.

Since the time for the carburization process is kept constant at 1 hour, the rate constant \( k \) is proportional to the case depth. If we want to double the case depth by increasing the temperature, we need to find the new temperature \( T' \) at which the rate constant \( k' \) is twice the original rate constant \( k \).

Let's denote the original temperature as \( T_1 \) and the new temperature as \( T_2 \). We have:

\[ k' = 2k \]

Using the Arrhenius equation for both temperatures, we get:

\[ A \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT_1}\right) = k \]
\[ A \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT_2}\right) = 2k \]

Dividing the second equation by the first, we get:

\[ \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT_2}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT_1}\right)} = 2 \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we obtain:

\[ -\frac{Q}{RT_2} + \frac{Q}{RT_1} = \ln(2) \]

Rearranging for \( T_2 \), we get:

\[ \frac{Q}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = \ln(2) \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{R \ln(2)}{Q} \]

\[ T_1 = 1300 \, K \]
\[ Q = 148 \times 10^3 \, J \, mol^{-1} \]
\[ R = 8.314 \, J \, mol^{-1} \, K^{-1} \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1300} - \frac{8.314 \ln(2)}{148 \times 10^3} \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1300} - \frac{8.314 \times 0.693}{148 \times 10^3} \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1300} - \frac{5.77}{148 \times 10^3} \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1300} - \frac{1}{25666.37} \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{25666.37 - 1300}{1300 \times 25666.37} \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{25436.37}{33366257} \]

\[ T_2 = \frac{33366257}{25436.37} \]

\[ T_2 \approx 1312 \, K \]

So, the temperature must be increased to approximately 1312 K to double the case depth, keeping the time constant at 1 hour.

Photons with energy less than the energy gap will not have enough energy to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, and thus, the material will be opaque to them.

The energy of a photon (E) is related to its wavelength (λ) by the equation:

\[ E = \frac{hc}{λ} \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy of the photon,
- \( h \) is Planck's constant,

\[ λ = \frac{1.989 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J m}}{1.072 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}} \]

Given the potential energy function:

\[ U(r) = -\frac{A}{r^3} + \frac{B}{r^7} \]

We take the derivative of U(r) with respect to r:

\[ \frac{dU}{dr} = \frac{d}{dr}\left(-\frac{A}{r^3} + \frac{B}{r^7}\right) \]

\[ \frac{dU}{dr} = 3\frac{A}{r^4} - 7\frac{B}{r^8} \]

\[ 3\frac{A}{r^4} - 7\frac{B}{r^8} = 0 \]

\[ 3A r^4 = 7B \]

\[ r^4 = \frac{7B}{3A} \]

\[ r = \left(\frac{7B}{3A}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \]

The lowest value of $T_f$( in °C) at which material will fail is?(round off to the nearest integer.). Assume that there is no plastic deformation during thermal cycling. "," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the thermal stress developed in the ceramic material during the thermal cycling and find the temperature at which this stress reaches the maximum compressive stress that the material can withstand without failure.

The thermal stress $\sigma_{thermal}$ developed in a constrained material during temperature change can be calculated using the following formula:

$$\sigma_{thermal} = E \cdot \alpha \cdot \Delta T$$

where:
- $E$ is the modulus of elasticity,
- $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and
- $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

Given:
- $E = 200 \text{ GPa} = 200 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}$ (since 1 GPa = $10^9$ Pa),
- $\alpha = 7.5 \times 10^{-6} °C^{-1}$,
- The maximum compressive stress the material can withstand, $\sigma_{max} = 200 \text{ MPa} = 200 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}$ (since 1 MPa = $10^6$ Pa),
- The change in temperature, $\Delta T = T_f - 25°C$.

We want to find the lowest value of $T_f$ at which the material will fail, so we set the thermal stress equal to the maximum compressive stress:

$$\sigma_{max} = E \cdot \alpha \cdot \Delta T$$

Now we solve for $\Delta T$:

$$\Delta T = \frac{\sigma_{max}}{E \cdot \alpha}$$

Substitute the given values:

$$\Delta T = \frac{200 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}}{(200 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}) \cdot (7.5 \times 10^{-6} °C^{-1})}$$

$$\Delta T = \frac{200 \times 10^6}{200 \times 10^9 \times 7.5 \times 10^{-6}}$$

$$\Delta T = \frac{1}{7.5} \times 10^3$$

$$\Delta T = \frac{10^3}{7.5}$$

$$\Delta T = 133.33°C$$

The greater the undercooling, the smaller the critical nucleus size needed to initiate solidification.

Given that the metal has a melting point of 600 °C, the degree of undercooling for each temperature is as follows:

- At 500 °C: undercooling = 600 °C - 500 °C = 100 °C

- At 300 °C: undercooling = 600 °C - 300 °C = 300 °C

As we can see, the degree of undercooling increases as the solidification temperature decreases. A larger undercooling means that less thermal energy is required to overcome the activation energy barrier for nucleation, which results in a smaller critical nucleus size.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (B) smaller for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C
- (C) larger for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 300 °C

- **Liquids** have a less ordered structure than crystalline solids, with molecules free to move past each other. This results in higher entropy compared to the solid phase. The enthalpy of a liquid is higher than that of the corresponding crystalline solid because the intermolecular forces are not as optimally arranged.

- **Glasses** are amorphous solids that have a disordered structure like liquids but behave mechanically like solids. The glass transition temperature (T_g) is the temperature range where a material transitions from a viscous liquid to a rigid glass. Below T_g, the material is considered a glass.

Now, considering the options:

(A) Glass has higher enthalpy than both the corresponding crystalline and liquid phases.
This is generally not true. Glass typically has a higher enthalpy than the crystalline phase but lower than the liquid phase because it is more ordered than a liquid but less ordered than a crystal.

(B) Glass has lower enthalpy than both the corresponding crystalline and liquid phases.
This is not true because the crystalline phase usually has the lowest enthalpy due to its ordered structure.

(C) Glass has higher entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and lower entropy than the corresponding liquid phase.
This is the correct statement. Glass has a higher entropy than the crystalline phase because it is less ordered, but it has a lower entropy than the liquid phase because it is more rigid and less disordered.

(D) Glass has lower entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and higher entropy than the corresponding liquid phase.
This is not true because the crystalline phase has the lowest entropy due to its highly ordered structure, and the liquid phase has the highest entropy due to its disordered structure.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is:

- Glass has higher entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and lower entropy than the corresponding liquid phase.

Therefore, the answer is:

[ (C) Glass has higher entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and lower entropy than the corresponding liquid phase. ]",,,0,

The absorption coefficient (α) of germanium at 1.3 µm is 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$.," To solve this problem, we can use the Beer-Lambert law, which relates the absorption of light to the properties of the material through which the light is traveling. The Beer-Lambert law is given by:

\[ I = I_0 \exp(-\alpha x) \]

where:
- \( I \) is the intensity of the transmitted light,
- \( I_0 \) is the intensity of the incident light,
- \( \alpha \) is the absorption coefficient,
- \( x \) is the thickness of the material.

We want to find the thickness \( x \) that will absorb 80% of the incident radiation, which means that the transmitted intensity \( I \) should be 20% of the incident intensity \( I_0 \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ 0.20 I_0 = I_0 \exp(-\alpha x) \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( I_0 \):

\[ 0.20 = \exp(-\alpha x) \]

Now, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ \ln(0.20) = -\alpha x \]

\[ x = -\frac{\ln(0.20)}{\alpha} \]

Given that the absorption coefficient \( \alpha \) is \( 3.3 \times 10^5 \) m\(^{-1}\), we can plug in the values:

\[ x = -\frac{\ln(0.20)}{3.3 \times 10^5 \text{ m}^{-1}} \]

First, calculate the natural logarithm of 0.20:

\[ \ln(0.20) \approx -1.609 \]

Now, plug in the values:

\[ x = -\frac{-1.609}{3.3 \times 10^5 \text{ m}^{-1}} \]

\[ x \approx \frac{1.609}{3.3 \times 10^5} \text{ m} \]

\[ x \approx 4.878 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} \]

Since we want the thickness in micrometers (µm), and 1 meter is \( 10^6 \) micrometers, we convert \( x \) to µm:

\[ x \approx 4.878 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} \times 10^6 \text{ µm/m} \]

\[ x \approx 4.878 \text{ µm} \]

Therefore, the thickness of the germanium crystal layer required to absorb 80% of the incident radiation at a wavelength of 1.3 µm is approximately 4.878 µm.

Here is the correct answer in a list:

If the density of titania is 4.23 g $cm^(−3)$, the diameter(in nm) of the particles is"," To solve for the diameter of the spherical titania nanoparticles, we need to use the relationship between the specific surface area, the density, and the size of the particles.

The specific surface area (SSA) is given as 125 $m^2$ $g^{-1}$. This means that for every gram of titania, there are 125 square meters of surface area available.

The density of titania is given as 4.23 $g$ $cm^{-3}$. This means that there are 4.23 grams of titania in every cubic centimeter.

First, we need to find the volume of a single nanoparticle. Since we know the density and the mass of a single particle, we can find the volume. However, we need to express the mass of a single particle in grams. To do this, we can assume a mass (m) for a single particle and then find the actual mass using the density.

Let's assume the mass of one particle to be a tiny fraction of a gram, say $1 \times 10^{-18}$ grams, which is a reasonable assumption for a nanoparticle.

Now, we can calculate the volume (V) of one particle using the density (ρ):

\[ V = \frac{m}{\rho} \]
\[ V = \frac{1 \times 10^{-18} \text{ g}}{4.23 \text{ g cm}^{-3}} \]
\[ V \approx 2.36 \times 10^{-19} \text{ cm}^{3} \]

Since the particles are spherical, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere to find the radius (r):

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

Solving for r:

\[ r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi} \]
\[ r^3 = \frac{3 \times 2.36 \times 10^{-19} \text{ cm}^{3}}{4\pi} \]
\[ r^3 \approx 5.61 \times 10^{-20} \text{ cm}^{3} \]
\[ r \approx (5.61 \times 10^{-20})^{1/3} \text{ cm} \]
\[ r \approx 3.83 \times 10^{-7} \text{ cm} \]
\[ r \approx 3.83 \text{ nm} \]

Now, we have the radius in nanometers. To find the diameter (d), we simply double the radius:

\[ d = 2r \]
\[ d \approx 2 \times 3.83 \text{ nm} \]
\[ d \approx 7.66 \text{ nm} \]

Therefore, the diameter of the titania nanoparticles is approximately 7.66 nm.

Here is the final answer in a list:

If 7 * $10^(20)$ atoms are pumped into the upper level with 4 * $10^(20)$ atoms in the lower level, the amount of energy released in a single pulse in Joules (give answer up to 2 decimal places)."," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy released when the atoms transition from the higher energy level to the lower energy level. This energy is carried away by photons.

First, we need to find the energy of a single photon using the wavelength of the photon and Planck's constant. The energy of a photon (E) is given by the equation:

\[ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \]

where:
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.6 \times 10^{-34} \) J s),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the photon (500 nm, which we need to convert to meters: \( 500 \times 10^{-9} \) m).

Now, let's calculate the energy of a single photon:

\[ E = \frac{(6.6 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}) \times (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})}{500 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}} \]
\[ E = \frac{(6.6 \times 3) \times 10^{-26} \text{ J}}{500 \times 10^{-9}} \]
\[ E = \frac{19.8 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J}}{500 \times 10^{-9}} \]
\[ E = 3.96 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} \]

Next, we need to find out how many photons are emitted when the atoms transition to the lower energy level. Since there are \( 7 \times 10^{20} \) atoms in the upper level and \( 4 \times 10^{20} \) atoms in the lower level, the number of atoms that will undergo a transition is the difference between these two numbers:

\[ \text{Number of transitions} = 7 \times 10^{20} - 4 \times 10^{20} \]
\[ \text{Number of transitions} = 3 \times 10^{20} \]

Each transition results in the emission of one photon, so the number of photons emitted is equal to the number of transitions.

Now, we can calculate the total energy released by multiplying the energy of a single photon by the number of photons:

\[ \text{Total energy released} = E \times \text{Number of transitions} \]
\[ \text{Total energy released} = (3.96 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}) \times (3 \times 10^{20}) \]
\[ \text{Total energy released} = 118.8 \times 10^{-19+20} \text{ J} \]
\[ \text{Total energy released} = 118.8 \times 10 \text{ J} \]
\[ \text{Total energy released} = 1188 \text{ J} \]

Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy released in a single pulse is:

The fundamental accuracy with which the position of the electron can be determined simultaneously with the speed in the same experiment in mm? (give answer up to 2 decimal places)"," To solve this problem, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is at least as large as Planck's constant divided by 4π. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

Δx * Δp ≥ h / (4π)

First, we need to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The momentum (p) of an object is given by the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v). The uncertainty in momentum can be found by taking the derivative of momentum with respect to velocity, which in this case is simply the mass of the electron, since the percentage uncertainty in velocity is given:

Δp = m * Δv

The uncertainty in velocity (Δv) is given as 0.01% of the speed of the electron (v):

Δv = v * 0.0001

Given that the speed of the electron (v) is 300 m/s, we can calculate Δv:

Δv = 300 m/s * 0.0001 = 0.003 m/s

Now we can find Δp:

Δp = m * Δv = 9.1 * 10^(-31) kg * 0.003 m/s = 2.73 * 10^(-33) kg m/s

Now we can use the uncertainty principle to find the uncertainty in position (Δx):

Δx ≥ h / (4π * Δp)

Substituting the values of h and Δp:

Δx ≥ (6.6 * 10^(-34) J s) / (4π * 2.73 * 10^(-33) kg m/s)

Δx ≥ (6.6 * 10^(-34)) / (4 * 3.1415 * 2.73 * 10^(-33))

Δx ≥ (6.6 / (4 * 3.1415 * 2.73)) * 10^(-34 + 33)

Δx ≥ (6.6 / 34.557) * 10^(-1)

Δx ≥ 0.19097 * 10^(-1)

Δx ≥ 0.019097 m

To convert this to millimeters (mm), we multiply by 1000 (since 1 m = 1000 mm):

Δx ≥ 0.019097 m * 1000 mm/m

Δx ≥ 19.097 mm

Rounded to two decimal places, the fundamental accuracy with which the position of the electron can be determined simultaneously with the speed is:

Δx ≈ 19.10 mm

(round off to 2 decimal places)"," To find the de Broglie wavelength of an electron accelerated across a potential difference, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the kinetic energy (KE) of the electron after being accelerated by the potential difference (V).
2. Use the de Broglie relation to find the wavelength (λ) associated with the electron.

Step 1: Calculate Kinetic Energy (KE)
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by the potential difference (V) times the charge of the electron (e):
\[ KE = eV \]

Given that the potential difference (V) is 300 kV, we first convert it to joules:
\[ V = 300 \times 10^3 \, \text{V} \]
\[ e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \]
\[ KE = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}) \times (300 \times 10^3 \, \text{V}) \]
\[ KE = 4.8 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J} \]

Step 2: Use the de Broglie Relation
The de Broglie wavelength (λ) is given by:
\[ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \]
where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( p \) is the momentum of the electron. The momentum can be found from the kinetic energy using the relation:
\[ p = \sqrt{2mKE} \]
where \( m \) is the rest mass of the electron.

Given that \( h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s} \) and the electron rest mass \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \), we can calculate the momentum:
\[ p = \sqrt{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \times 4.8 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}} \]
\[ p = \sqrt{2 \times 9.11 \times 4.8 \times 10^{-45} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{J}} \]
\[ p = \sqrt{8.8308 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{kg}^2 \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2} \]
\[ p = 9.40 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \]

Now we can find the de Broglie wavelength:
\[ \lambda = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}}{9.40 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}} \]
\[ \lambda = 7.05 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m} \]

The stress on the polymer must remain above 14.5 MPa in order for the assembly to function properly. The expected life(in hours) of the assembly is? (round off to the nearest integer)," To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the stress decreases over time and then use that rate to predict how long it will take for the stress to drop to the minimum functional level of 14.5 MPa.

Given:
- Initial stress, \( \sigma_0 = 17 \) MPa
- Stress after 100 hours, \( \sigma_{100} = 16.6 \) MPa
- Minimum functional stress, \( \sigma_{\text{min}} = 14.5 \) MPa

First, we calculate the stress drop over the first 100 hours:
\[ \Delta \sigma = \sigma_0 - \sigma_{100} = 17 \text{ MPa} - 16.6 \text{ MPa} = 0.4 \text{ MPa} \]

Now, we assume that the stress decreases linearly over time. This assumption is reasonable given the constant strain condition and the lack of other information suggesting a different stress-time relationship.

The rate of stress decrease per hour is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.4 \text{ MPa}}{100 \text{ hours}} = 0.004 \text{ MPa/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the stress to decrease from the initial stress \( \sigma_0 \) to the minimum functional stress \( \sigma_{\text{min}} \). The total stress drop to reach the minimum functional stress is:
\[ \Delta \sigma_{\text{total}} = \sigma_0 - \sigma_{\text{min}} = 17 \text{ MPa} - 14.5 \text{ MPa} = 2.5 \text{ MPa} \]

Using the rate of stress decrease, we can calculate the time \( t \) it takes for this total stress drop to occur:
\[ t = \frac{\Delta \sigma_{\text{total}}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{2.5 \text{ MPa}}{0.004 \text{ MPa/hour}} = 625 \text{ hours} \]

- \( k \) is the rate constant,
- \( A \) is the pre-exponential factor (frequency of attempts),
- \( E_a \) is the activation energy,

- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

For the formation of Schottky defects, we can assume that the rate constant \( k \) is proportional to the number of defects formed. Since we are interested in the number of defects per mole, we can modify the equation to solve for the number of defects \( N \) instead of \( k \):

\[ N = N_0 \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right) \]

where \( N_0 \) is the total number of possible sites for Schottky defects per mole, which is equivalent to Avogadro's number for a molecule like KCl where each formula unit could potentially be a Schottky defect.

Now, let's calculate the shift in Fermi energy due to doping. Since silicon is doped with 1 ppm of phosphorus atoms, which are donors, the electron concentration $n$ will increase. The shift in Fermi energy can be approximated using the following relationship for non-degenerate semiconductors:

\[ n = N_C \exp\left(-\frac{E_F - E_C}{k_BT}\right) \]

Where $N_C$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band, and $E_F - E_C$ is the energy difference between the Fermi level and the conduction band edge.

For a non-degenerate semiconductor, the intrinsic carrier concentration is much less than the doping concentration, so we can assume that the electron concentration $n$ due to doping is equal to the doping concentration:

\[ n = 1 \text{ ppm of Si atoms} = 5 \times 10^{28} \text{ m}^{-3} \times 10^{-6} \]

\[ n = 5 \times 10^{22} \text{ m}^{-3} \]

- \( k \) is the rate constant,
- \( t \) is the time.

The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is? (round off to 2 decimal places)"," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume expansion of graphite in two directions: parallel and perpendicular to the graphite layers. The volume expansion coefficient can be related to the linear expansion coefficients in the following way:

β (volume expansion coefficient) ≈ α_parallel + 2α_perpendicular

This is because graphite has a hexagonal crystal structure, and the expansion perpendicular to the layers occurs in two dimensions, while the expansion parallel to the layers occurs in one dimension.

Given:
α_parallel = 0.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)
α_perpendicular = 29 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)

First, we calculate the average temperature of the heating process:
T_avg = (900 K + 1100 K) / 2 = 1000 K

Now we calculate the volume expansion coefficient at this average temperature:
β ≈ α_parallel + 2α_perpendicular
β ≈ 0.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) + 2 * 29 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)
β ≈ 0.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) + 58 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)
β ≈ 58.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)

The fractional change in volume ΔV/V for a temperature change ΔT is given by:
ΔV/V = β * ΔT

The change in temperature ΔT is:
ΔT = 1100 K - 900 K = 200 K

Now we calculate the fractional change in volume:
ΔV/V = 58.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) * 200 K
ΔV/V = 0.01176

To find the percentage increase in volume, we multiply the fractional change by 100:
Percentage increase in volume = ΔV/V * 100%
Percentage increase in volume = 0.01176 * 100%
Percentage increase in volume = 1.176%

Rounded to two decimal places, the percentage increase in volume is:
Percentage increase in volume ≈ 1.18%

Therefore, the final answer is:

(A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing"," To achieve a contiguous planar thin film deposition while avoiding island type of growth, the goal is to promote lateral growth (layer-by-layer growth) rather than nucleation of isolated islands that can lead to a discontinuous film. Here's an analysis of the options provided:

(A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film:
- A low interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the metal film could potentially lead to poor adhesion, as the two materials would not have a strong tendency to bond together. This could actually promote island growth rather than prevent it.

(B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited:
- While a low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$ might seem beneficial for adhesion to the substrate, it is equally important for the adhesion layer to have good interaction with the metal film. The adhesion layer should promote wetting of the metal film to ensure a contiguous layer.

(C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate:
- Increasing the substrate temperature can provide the adatoms (deposited atoms) with more mobility on the substrate surface, which can help them to find lower energy positions and promote lateral growth rather than nucleating new islands. Decreasing the deposition rate can also help by giving the adatoms more time to migrate and coalesce into a continuous film before additional material is deposited. This step is in the right direction to achieve a contiguous planar film.

(D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing:
- Intermittent deposition with annealing stages can allow the already deposited material to coalesce and form a more continuous film before additional material is added. Annealing can help to remove defects and promote diffusion of adatoms, leading to better film quality and a more planar surface. This step is also in the right direction.

Based on the above analysis, the steps that are in the right direction to achieve a contiguous planar thin film deposition are:

- (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate
- (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing

Therefore, the correct answers are:

- Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate
- Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing

\[ n_e = N_A \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\right) \]

Given that \( N_A = 6.02 \times 10^{23} \text{ mole}^{-1} \), \( k_B = 8.62 \times 10^{-5} \text{ eV/K} \), and \( T = 298 \text{ K} \), we can rearrange the equation to solve for \( E_g \):

\[ \exp\left(-\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\right) = \frac{n_e}{N_A} \]

\[ -\frac{E_g}{k_B T} = \ln\left(\frac{n_e}{N_A}\right) \]

\[ E_g = -k_B T \cdot \ln\left(\frac{n_e}{N_A}\right) \]

However, we do not have the value for \( n_e \), the number of electrons excited. To find \( n_e \), we need to consider the resistivity of the semiconductor and the mobility of charge carriers.

The resistivity \( \rho \) of a semiconductor is given by:

\[ \rho = \frac{1}{q (n_e \mu_e + n_h \mu_h)} \]

where \( q \) is the elementary charge, \( \mu_e \) is the mobility of electrons, \( \mu_h \) is the mobility of holes, \( n_e \) is the concentration of electrons, and \( n_h \) is the concentration of holes.

Given that the resistivity \( \rho = 3000 \ \Omega \text{m} \), \( \mu_e = 0.14 \ m^2/(V \ s) \), \( \mu_h = 0.06 \ m^2/(V \ s) \), and \( q = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} \), we can assume that in a pure semiconductor, the concentration of electrons and holes are equal, i.e., \( n_e = n_h \). This is because each electron that is excited across the band gap creates a hole.

Let's solve for \( n_e \) using the resistivity equation:

\[ 3000 = \frac{1}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} (n_e \cdot 0.14 + n_e \cdot 0.06)} \]

\[ 3000 = \frac{1}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \cdot n_e \cdot (0.14 + 0.06)} \]

\[ 3000 = \frac{1}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \cdot n_e \cdot 0.20} \]

\[ n_e = \frac{1}{3000 \cdot 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \cdot 0.20} \]

\[ n_e = \frac{1}{9.60 \times 10^{-17}} \]

\[ n_e \approx 1.04 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}^{-3} \]

Now that we have \( n_e \), we can substitute it back into the equation for \( E_g \):

The refractive index of the glass material is 1.5 and the absorption coefficient can be changed from 0.3 $cm^(-1)$ to 1 $cm^(-1)$. In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places) "," To solve this problem, we need to understand how light transmission through a material is affected by its absorption coefficient and refractive index. The intensity of light transmitted through a material decreases exponentially with the thickness of the material and the absorption coefficient. The transmittance T can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ T = e^{-\alpha x} \]

where:
- \( T \) is the transmittance (the fraction of light that comes out of the other side),
- \( \alpha \) is the absorption coefficient,
- \( x \) is the thickness of the material.

Given that the thickness \( x \) of the glass panel is 5 mm, which is 0.5 cm, and the absorption coefficient \( \alpha \) can vary from 0.3 \( cm^{-1} \) to 1 \( cm^{-1} \), we can calculate the transmittance for both the maximum and minimum absorption coefficients.

For the minimum absorption coefficient \( \alpha_{min} = 0.3 \) \( cm^{-1} \):

\[ T_{max} = e^{-\alpha_{min} x} = e^{-0.3 \times 0.5} \]

For the maximum absorption coefficient \( \alpha_{max} = 1 \) \( cm^{-1} \):

\[ T_{min} = e^{-\alpha_{max} x} = e^{-1 \times 0.5} \]

Now we calculate the ratio of the maximum transmittance to the minimum transmittance:

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{T_{max}}{T_{min}} = \frac{e^{-0.3 \times 0.5}}{e^{-1 \times 0.5}} \]

Using the properties of exponents, we can simplify this to:

\[ \text{Ratio} = e^{(-0.3 \times 0.5) - (-1 \times 0.5)} = e^{(1 - 0.3) \times 0.5} \]

\[ \text{Ratio} = e^{0.7 \times 0.5} = e^{0.35} \]

Now we calculate the numerical value of this ratio and round it to two decimal places:

\[ \text{Ratio} \approx e^{0.35} \approx 1.42 \]

So the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel, rounded to two decimal places, is approximately 1.42.

Assuming that the liquid-solid interface is at the melting temperature, the temperature from the interface into the liquid  (A) Decreases (B) Increases (C) Remains constant (D) Increases and then decreases"," During the solidification of a pure metal, dendrites are formed due to the fact that the solid does not form uniformly across the liquid. Instead, some regions start to solidify before others, and these regions grow into the liquid in a branched, tree-like structure known as dendrites.

The temperature at the liquid-solid interface remains constant at the melting temperature of the metal during the solidification process. This is because the latent heat of fusion is being released at the interface as the liquid transforms into a solid. However, moving away from the interface into the liquid, the temperature of the liquid metal will decrease as it gets further from the heat source that is maintaining the interface at the melting temperature.

\[ k = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right) \]

where:
- \( A \) is the pre-exponential factor (frequency of correctly oriented collisions),
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
- \( E_a \) is the activation energy in J/mol.

We are given that the activation energy \( E_a \) is 8.314 kJ/mol, which we need to convert to J/mol for consistency with the gas constant:

\[ E_a = 8.314 \times 10^3 \text{ J/mol} \]

The initial rate constant \( k_1 \) at 300 K is:

\[ k_1 = A \exp\left(-\frac{8.314 \times 10^3 \text{ J/mol}}{8.314 \text{ J/(mol·K)} \times 300 \text{ K}}\right) \]

We want to find the temperature \( T_2 \) at which the rate constant \( k_2 \) is three times \( k_1 \):

\[ k_2 = 3k_1 = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\right) \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) and setting them equal to each other gives:

\[ \ln(3k_1) = \ln\left(A \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\right)\right) \]

\[ \ln(3) + \ln(k_1) = \ln(A) - \frac{E_a}{RT_2} \]

Since \( \ln(A) \) is a constant, we can equate the exponential terms:

\[ \ln(3) = \frac{E_a}{RT_1} - \frac{E_a}{RT_2} \]

\[ \ln(3) = \frac{E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) \]

\[ \frac{\ln(3)}{10^3} = \frac{1}{300} - \frac{1}{T_2} \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{300} - \frac{\ln(3)}{10^3} \]

Now we calculate the value of \( \frac{1}{T_2} \):

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{300} - \frac{\ln(3)}{10^3} \]

\[ \frac{1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{300} - \frac{1.0986}{10^3} \]

This occurs when the energy of the A-B bonds is not favorable compared to the energy of A-A and B-B bonds.

The condition for the miscibility gap can be understood by considering the enthalpy of mixing. When A and B atoms are mixed, the change in enthalpy depends on the bond energies. If $ε_{AB}$ is greater than the average of $ε_{AA}$ and $ε_{BB}$, it means that forming A-B bonds requires more energy than breaking A-A and B-B bonds and forming new A-A and B-B bonds in separate phases.

Given the integral enthalpy of mixing:
$$ΔH^{mix} = -19250 \cdot χ_{Cu} \cdot χ_{Zn}$$

Since $χ_{Cu} + χ_{Zn} = 1$, we can express $χ_{Zn}$ as $1 - χ_{Cu}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:
$$ΔH^{mix} = -19250 \cdot χ_{Cu} \cdot (1 - χ_{Cu})$$

Now, to find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we take the derivative of $ΔH^{mix}$ with respect to $χ_{Cu}$:

$$\frac{∂ΔH^{mix}}{∂χ_{Cu}} = -19250 + 38500 \cdot χ_{Cu}$$

This expression represents the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu in terms of $χ_{Cu}$. However, we need to express it in terms of $χ_{Zn}$ to match the answer choices. Since $χ_{Cu} = 1 - χ_{Zn}$, we can substitute again:

Assuming regular solution behaviour, the solution parameter (in J/mol) is  (A) -19250 (B) -9625 (C) 13.75 (D) 2315.4 "," To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the enthalpy of mixing and the solution parameter for a regular solution.

The enthalpy of mixing for a binary solution can be expressed as:

\[ \Delta H^{(mix)} = W_{Cu,Zn} \cdot \chi_{Cu} \cdot \chi_{Zn} \]

where:
- \( \Delta H^{(mix)} \) is the integral enthalpy of mixing,
- \( W_{Cu,Zn} \) is the solution parameter (also known as the interaction parameter or the regular solution parameter) for the Cu-Zn system,
- \( \chi_{Cu} \) is the mole fraction of copper,
- \( \chi_{Zn} \) is the mole fraction of zinc.

Given the equation:

\[ \Delta H^{(mix)} = -19250 \cdot \chi_{Cu} \cdot \chi_{Zn} \]

we can see that the solution parameter \( W_{Cu,Zn} \) is the coefficient of the product of the mole fractions of copper and zinc. Therefore, the solution parameter \( W_{Cu,Zn} \) is -19250 J/mol.

Since the question asks for the solution parameter assuming regular solution behavior, and we have been given the enthalpy of mixing equation with the parameter directly, we can conclude that the solution parameter is:

What is the activity of Q in an alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6 at the same temperature?," To find the activity of component Q in the Q-R alloy, we can use the activity coefficient equation given and the definition of activity. The activity of a component in a solution (in this case, an alloy) is the product of its mole fraction and its activity coefficient.

Given the equation for the activity coefficient of Q:

\[ \ln \gamma_Q = 0.6 \cdot (x_R)^2 - 0.2 \cdot (x_R)^3 \]

And the mole fraction of R, \( x_R = 0.6 \), we can calculate the activity coefficient of Q at this composition:

\[ \ln \gamma_Q = 0.6 \cdot (0.6)^2 - 0.2 \cdot (0.6)^3 \]
\[ \ln \gamma_Q = 0.6 \cdot 0.36 - 0.2 \cdot 0.216 \]
\[ \ln \gamma_Q = 0.216 - 0.0432 \]
\[ \ln \gamma_Q = 0.1728 \]

Now, to find the activity coefficient \( \gamma_Q \), we take the exponential of both sides:

\[ \gamma_Q = e^{0.1728} \]

Next, we calculate the activity of Q, \( a_Q \), using the mole fraction of Q, which is \( x_Q = 1 - x_R = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 \):

\[ a_Q = \gamma_Q \cdot x_Q \]
\[ a_Q = e^{0.1728} \cdot 0.4 \]

Now we calculate the numerical value:

\[ \gamma_Q = e^{0.1728} \approx 1.189 \]
\[ a_Q = 1.189 \cdot 0.4 \approx 0.4756 \]

Therefore, the activity of Q in the alloy with \( x_R = 0.6 \) is approximately 0.4756.

Assume that air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen.," To solve this problem, we need to use the stoichiometry of the combustion reaction of methane ($CH_4$) and the composition of air. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:

\[ CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O \]

This equation tells us that one mole of methane reacts with two moles of oxygen to produce one mole of carbon dioxide and two moles of water.

Since we are dealing with volumes at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure), we can use Avogadro's Law, which states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules (or moles). Therefore, we can directly use the stoichiometric coefficients as volume ratios.

Given that air contains 21% oxygen by volume, we need to calculate the volume of air that contains the required amount of oxygen for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ of $CH_4$.

From the balanced equation, we need 2 moles (or volumes) of oxygen for every mole (or volume) of methane. So for 100 $m^3$ of $CH_4$, we need:

\[ 100 \, m^3 \, CH_4 \times 2 = 200 \, m^3 \, O_2 \]

Now, since only 21% of air is oxygen, we need to find out how much air contains 200 $m^3$ of oxygen. We can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{200 \, m^3 \, O_2}{0.21 \, O_2 \, in \, air} = \frac{x \, m^3 \, air}{1.00 \, air} \]

Solving for x gives us:

\[ x = \frac{200}{0.21} = 952.38 \, m^3 \, air \]

Therefore, the theoretical requirement of air for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ of pure $CH_4$ at STP is approximately 952.38 $m^3$.

The Gibbs free energy change is given by the equation:

∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°

In an Ellingham diagram, the slope of the plot of ∆G° versus temperature (T) for a given reaction can provide insights into the thermodynamic properties of the reaction. The slope of this line is determined by the temperature dependence of ∆G°, which is influenced by the signs of ∆S° and ∆H°.

If the slope of the line is positive, it means that ∆G° increases with increasing temperature. According to the Gibbs free energy equation, for ∆G° to increase with temperature, the term T∆S° must decrease more rapidly than ∆H° increases. This can only happen if ∆S° is negative because a negative ∆S° would make the T∆S° term positive and increasing with temperature, thus causing ∆G° to increase as well.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- [ ] A) ∆S° is positive
- [ ] B) ∆S° is negative
- [ ] C) ∆H° is positive
- [x] D) ∆H° is negative

The positive slope indicates that the reaction has a negative entropy change (∆S°), which means the system becomes more ordered when the reaction proceeds from reactants to products. The enthalpy change (∆H°) can be either positive or negative, but for the slope to be positive, it must be less positive or negative, such that the increase in T∆S° is greater than the increase in ∆H° with temperature.",,,0,

(D) Increasing temperature and decreasing pressure."," To determine which conditions will favor the forward reaction in the given equilibrium:

\[ C (s) + CO_2 (g) \rightleftharpoons 2CO (g) \]

we need to consider the principles of Le Chatelier's principle and the sign of the enthalpy change, \( ∆H° \), for the reaction.

Given that \( ∆H°_{298} = 172000 \) joules per mole of \( CO_2 \), we know that the reaction is endothermic because the enthalpy change is positive. An endothermic reaction will favor the forward reaction when the temperature is increased, as the system will absorb heat to produce more products.

Now, let's consider the effect of pressure:

- Increasing the pressure by decreasing the volume will favor the reaction that produces fewer moles of gas. In the given reaction, the forward reaction produces 2 moles of CO from 1 mole of CO2, which means increasing the pressure will favor the reverse reaction.
- Decreasing the pressure by increasing the volume will favor the reaction that produces more moles of gas, which in this case is the forward reaction.

Considering both temperature and pressure effects:

- (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure: The increase in temperature favors the forward reaction, but the increase in pressure favors the reverse reaction. These effects are opposing.
- (B) Decreasing temperature and increasing pressure: The decrease in temperature favors the reverse reaction, and the increase in pressure also favors the reverse reaction. This option does not favor the forward reaction.

$$∆S_{mix} = -R(X_A \cdot \ln[X_A] + X_B \cdot \ln[X_B])$$

where $X_A$ and $X_B$ are the mole fractions of components A and B, respectively, and $R$ is the ideal gas constant.

To find the maximum value of $∆S_{mix}$, we need to find the condition where the derivative of $∆S_{mix}$ with respect to $X_A$ is zero. Since $X_A + X_B = 1$, we can express $X_B$ as $1 - X_A$. The entropy equation can then be written as:

$$∆S_{mix} = -R(X_A \cdot \ln[X_A] + (1 - X_A) \cdot \ln[1 - X_A])$$

Taking the derivative of $∆S_{mix}$ with respect to $X_A$ gives:

$$\frac{d(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A} = -R \left( \ln[X_A] + X_A \cdot \frac{1}{X_A} - \ln[1 - X_A] - (1 - X_A) \cdot \frac{1}{1 - X_A} \right)$$

Simplifying the derivative:

$$\frac{d(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A} = -R \left( \ln[X_A] + 1 - \ln[1 - X_A] - 1 \right)$$

$$\frac{d(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A} = -R \left( \ln[X_A] - \ln[1 - X_A] \right)$$

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the maximum:

$$0 = -R \left( \ln[X_A] - \ln[1 - X_A] \right)$$

$$\ln[X_A] = \ln[1 - X_A]$$

Exponentiating both sides to remove the natural logarithm:

$$X_A = 1 - X_A$$

Solving for $X_A$:

$$2X_A = 1$$

$$X_A = \frac{1}{2}$$

Therefore, the configurational entropy due to ideal mixing in a binary A-B system is maximum when $X_A = 0.5$. At this point, the system is equally mixed, with half of the molecules being A and half being B.

(D) ln k versus 1/T

The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant (k) of a chemical reaction to the temperature (T) and the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction:

k = A * e^(-Ea/(R*T))

where:
- k is the rate constant,
- A is the pre-exponential factor (frequency of correctly oriented collisions),
- Ea is the activation energy,
- R is the universal gas constant, and
- T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the Arrhenius equation gives:

ln k = ln A - Ea/(R*T)

This equation is in the form of a straight line (y = mx + b), where ln k is the y-value, -Ea/R is the slope (m), and 1/T is the x-value. Therefore, a plot of ln k versus 1/T will yield a straight line with a slope equal to -Ea/R. By determining the slope of this line, one can estimate the activation energy of the reaction.

The following reactions are assumed to be at thermodynamic equilibrium: ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g) and  2CO(g) = $CO_2$(g) + C(s). Assume ideal gas behaviour. Based on mole balance, the relationship applicable to the system at equilibrium is  (A)	$p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$ (B) $p_(Zn)$ = 2*$p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (C) $p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (D) $p_(Zn)$ = 0.5*$p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$"," To solve this problem, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the given reactions and apply the mole balance principle.

The two reactions at thermodynamic equilibrium are:

1. \( ZnO(s) + C(s) \rightleftharpoons Zn(g) + CO(g) \)
2. \( 2CO(g) \rightleftharpoons CO_2(g) + C(s) \)

From the stoichiometry of the first reaction, we can see that 1 mole of Zn(g) is produced for every 1 mole of CO(g) produced. Therefore, at equilibrium, the partial pressure of Zn(g) will be equal to the partial pressure of CO(g):

\( p_{Zn} = p_{CO} \)

From the second reaction, 2 moles of CO(g) react to form 1 mole of CO_2(g) and 1 mole of C(s). Since C(s) is a solid, its concentration (or partial pressure) does not affect the equilibrium expression. Therefore, the equilibrium constant expression for this reaction would be:

\( K = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}^2} \)

However, we are not given the value of the equilibrium constant, nor are we asked to find it. We are asked to find a relationship between the partial pressures of the gaseous species at equilibrium.

Since the second reaction consumes 2 moles of CO(g) for every 1 mole of CO_2(g) produced, we can say that:

\( 2p_{CO} = p_{CO_2} \)

Now, we can combine the relationships from both reactions. Since \( p_{Zn} = p_{CO} \) and \( 2p_{CO} = p_{CO_2} \), we can substitute \( p_{CO} \) for \( p_{Zn} \) in the second equation:

\( 2p_{Zn} = p_{CO_2} \)

Rearranging this gives us:

\( p_{Zn} = 0.5p_{CO_2} \)

Now, we need to express \( p_{CO_2} \) in terms of \( p_{CO} \) and \( p_{Zn} \). Since \( p_{Zn} = p_{CO} \), we can substitute \( p_{CO} \) for \( p_{Zn} \) in the above equation:

\( p_{Zn} = 0.5p_{CO_2} \)

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

\( 2p_{Zn} = p_{CO_2} \)

Now, we can substitute \( 2p_{Zn} \) for \( p_{CO_2} \) in the original mole balance equation:

\( p_{Zn} = p_{CO} + 2p_{Zn} \)

Simplifying this, we get:

\( p_{Zn} = 3p_{Zn} \)

This simplification is incorrect because it implies that \( p_{Zn} \) is three times itself, which is not possible. Let's correct the approach.

We have established that \( p_{Zn} = p_{CO} \) and \( 2p_{CO} = p_{CO_2} \). Therefore, we can write:

\( p_{Zn} = p_{CO} + \frac{1}{2}p_{CO_2} \)

Substituting \( p_{CO} \) for \( p_{Zn} \) gives us:

\( p_{Zn} = p_{Zn} + \frac{1}{2}p_{CO_2} \)

This simplifies to:

\( 0 = \frac{1}{2}p_{CO_2} \)

This is not correct because it implies that \( p_{CO_2} \) is zero, which is not necessarily the case. We need to consider the correct stoichiometric coefficients in the mole balance.

Let's try again, using the correct stoichiometry:

From the first reaction, we have:
\( p_{Zn} = p_{CO} \)

From the second reaction, we have:
\( 2p_{CO} = p_{CO_2} \)

\[ x^2 = \frac{2r^2 \gamma_{SV}}{3\gamma_{SL}} \]

where:
- \(x\) is the neck size,
- \(r\) is the radius of the particles,
- \(\gamma_{SV}\) is the solid-vapor surface energy (which in this case we can assume to be approximately equal to the solid-solid grain boundary energy, \(\gamma_{SiC-SiC}\)),

Given:
- \(\gamma_{SiC-SiC} = 0.80 \, J.m^{-2}\),
- \(\gamma_{SiC-Ni} = 0.45 \, J.m^{-2}\),
- The diameter of the SiC grain is 20 µm, so the radius \(r\) is half of that, which is \(10 \, µm\).

First, we need to convert the surface energies from \(J.m^{-2}\) to \(N.m^{-1}\) (since \(1 \, J = 1 \, N.m\), the conversion is straightforward):
- \(\gamma_{SiC-SiC} = 0.80 \, N.m^{-1}\),
- \(\gamma_{SiC-Ni} = 0.45 \, N.m^{-1}\).

Now we can plug the values into the equation:

- \( P \) is the number of phases (solid, liquid, gas).

The adiabatic flame temperature(in K) for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is?(answer up to two decimal places)"," To calculate the adiabatic flame temperature for the combustion of carbon monoxide (CO) with stoichiometric oxygen, we need to consider the energy balance between the reactants and products. The reaction for the combustion of CO is:

\[ CO + \frac{1}{2}O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 \]

Given:
- The standard enthalpy change for the reaction at 298 K, \( ΔH°_{298} \) (CO → \( CO_2 \)) = -282000 kJ/(kg-mol of CO)
- The heat capacity of \( CO_2 \), \( C_p(CO_2) \) = 44 kJ/(kg-mol·K)
- The molar flow rate of CO entering the reactor, \( \dot{n}_{CO} \) = 1 kg-mol/h
- The initial temperature, \( T_{initial} \) = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

Since the reaction is adiabatic, the heat released by the reaction will raise the temperature of the products to the adiabatic flame temperature (AFT). We can assume that the heat capacity of \( CO_2 \) is constant over the temperature range considered, which allows us to use the following equation to find the AFT (T_f):

\[ \dot{n}_{CO} \cdot ΔH°_{298} = \dot{n}_{CO_2} \cdot C_p(CO_2) \cdot (T_f - T_{initial}) \]

Since the reaction is stoichiometric, the molar flow rate of \( CO_2 \) produced will be equal to the molar flow rate of CO entering the reactor, so \( \dot{n}_{CO_2} = \dot{n}_{CO} \). The equation simplifies to:

\[ ΔH°_{298} = C_p(CO_2) \cdot (T_f - T_{initial}) \]

Now we can solve for \( T_f \):

\[ T_f = T_{initial} + \frac{ΔH°_{298}}{C_p(CO_2)} \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ T_f = 298.15 K + \frac{-282000 kJ/(kg-mol)}{44 kJ/(kg-mol·K)} \]

\[ T_f = 298.15 K - 6409.09 K \]

This result is not physically meaningful, as the adiabatic flame temperature cannot be negative or below the initial temperature. The mistake here is that we did not account for the fact that the heat capacity is given per kg-mol of \( CO_2 \), and we need to consider the actual amount of \( CO_2 \) produced. Since the reaction is stoichiometric, 1 kg-mol of CO produces 1 kg-mol of \( CO_2 \), so the heat capacity term is already correct.

The correct calculation should be:

\[ T_f = 298.15 K + \frac{-282000 kJ/(kg-mol)}{44 kJ/(kg-mol·K)} \]

\[ T_f = 298.15 K + 6409.09 K \]

\[ T_f = 6707.24 K \]

However, this result is still incorrect because we have not considered the heat capacity of the reactants or the fact that the heat capacity of \( CO_2 \) is not constant over such a large temperature range. To get a more accurate result, we would need to integrate the heat capacity over the temperature range, considering the temperature dependence of \( C_p \) for both reactants and products.

For a simplified calculation using the given constant heat capacity, we can correct the calculation by considering the actual enthalpy change for the reaction at the initial temperature and assuming that all the energy released goes into heating the \( CO_2 \) from 298 K to the adiabatic flame temperature.

Let's correct the calculation:

Entropy change asssociated with cooling monoclinic sulfur from 368.5K to 0 K is -37.8 $J.K^(-1)$. Pure orthorhombic sulfure transforms to stable monoclinic sulfure monoclinic sulfure above 368.5K. Applying Third law of thermodynamics, the value of entropy (in $J.K^(-1)$) of transformation of 368.5 K is ?(answer up to two decimal places)"," To solve this problem, we need to apply the Third Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero (0K) is zero. Therefore, the entropy change for a process that starts and ends at 0K should also be zero for a perfect crystal.

Given the information:

1. The entropy change associated with heating orthorhombic sulfur from 0K to 368.5K is 36.86 J.K^(-1).
2. The entropy change associated with cooling monoclinic sulfur from 368.5K to 0K is -37.8 J.K^(-1).

The transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5K is a phase transition. According to the Third Law, if we start with orthorhombic sulfur at 0K, heat it to 368.5K, it undergoes a phase transition to monoclinic sulfur, and then cool the monoclinic sulfur back down to 0K, the overall entropy change should be zero because we've started and ended at the same temperature (0K).

Let's calculate the entropy change for the entire cycle:

1. Heating orthorhombic sulfur from 0K to 368.5K: +36.86 J.K^(-1)
2. Phase transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5K: ? (This is the value we want to find, let's call it ΔS_transformation)
3. Cooling monoclinic sulfur from 368.5K to 0K: -37.8 J.K^(-1)

The sum of these entropy changes should be zero:

36.86 J.K^(-1) + ΔS_transformation - 37.8 J.K^(-1) = 0

Now, we solve for ΔS_transformation:

ΔS_transformation = 37.8 J.K^(-1) - 36.86 J.K^(-1)
ΔS_transformation = 0.94 J.K^(-1)

Therefore, the entropy change associated with the transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5K is 0.94 J.K^(-1).

The final answer, rounded to two decimal places, is:

- 0.94 J.K^(-1)

For homogenous nucleation of solid in a liquid of a pure metal, the critical edge length(in nm) of a cube shaped nucleus is?(answer up to two decimal places)"," To find the critical edge length of a cube-shaped nucleus during homogeneous nucleation, we can use the following relationship derived from the balance of surface energy and volume free energy:

The total change in free energy ΔG for the formation of a nucleus can be expressed as the sum of the surface energy term and the volume free energy term:

ΔG = ΔG_surface + ΔG_volume

For a cube-shaped nucleus with edge length a, the surface area A is 6a^2 (since there are 6 faces on a cube), and the volume V is a^3. Therefore, we can write:

ΔG = γA - ΔG_vV
ΔG = γ(6a^2) - ΔG_v(a^3)

At the critical point, d(ΔG)/da = 0, which gives us the condition for the critical radius (or in this case, the critical edge length) for nucleation. Taking the derivative and setting it to zero:

d(ΔG)/da = 12γa - 3ΔG_v*a^2 = 0

Solving for a gives us:

a_critical = 2γ / (-ΔG_v)

Now we can plug in the given values:

γ = 0.177 J.m^(-2)
ΔG_v = -2.8 * 10^8 J.m^(-3)

a_critical = 2 * 0.177 J.m^(-2) / (-(-2.8 * 10^8 J.m^(-3)))

a_critical = 2 * 0.177 / (2.8 * 10^8)

a_critical = 0.354 / (2.8 * 10^8)

a_critical = 1.264285714 * 10^(-9) m

Converting from meters to nanometers (1 m = 10^9 nm):

a_critical = 1.264285714 nm

If the size of tungsten grains is 40 µm and the interfacial tungsten -tungsten and tungsten- nickel energies are 0.52 and 0.30 $J.m^(-2)$ respectively, the predicted avergae neck size (in µm) of sintered tungsten grain is:  (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 25"," To solve this problem, we need to use the parameters given to estimate the average neck size of the sintered tungsten grains. The neck size is the area where two grains are in contact and have started to bond together during the sintering process.

The driving force for neck growth during sintering is the reduction in interfacial energy. The neck size can be related to the balance of forces between the surface tension of the liquid phase (nickel in this case) and the interfacial energy between the solid grains (tungsten).

The relevant equation that relates the neck size \(x\) to the interfacial energies and the surface tension of the liquid phase is given by:

\[ x^2 = \frac{3\gamma_{SV}V}{2\pi\gamma_{LV}} \]

where:
- \(x\) is the neck size,
- \(\gamma_{SV}\) is the solid-vapor interfacial energy (which we can approximate as the tungsten-tungsten interfacial energy since the nickel will form the liquid phase and not be in contact with the vapor),
- \(V\) is the volume of the particle,
- \(\gamma_{LV}\) is the liquid-vapor interfacial energy (which we can approximate as the tungsten-nickel interfacial energy since the nickel is the liquid phase during sintering).

Given:
- \(\gamma_{SV}\) (tungsten-tungsten interfacial energy) = 0.52 \(J.m^{-2}\),
- \(\gamma_{LV}\) (tungsten-nickel interfacial energy) = 0.30 \(J.m^{-2}\),
- The size of tungsten grains (which we can assume to be spherical for simplicity) is 40 µm.

First, we need to calculate the volume of a tungsten grain:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \]
where \(r\) is the radius of the tungsten grain.

Since the diameter is given as 40 µm, the radius \(r\) is 20 µm (or \(20 \times 10^{-6}\) m). Let's convert this to meters to use in the equation:
\[ r = 20 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \]

Now, calculate the volume \(V\):
\[ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (20 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m})^3 \]
\[ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (8 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}^3) \]
\[ V \approx 33.51 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}^3 \]

Next, we can calculate the neck size \(x\):
\[ x^2 = \frac{3\gamma_{SV}V}{2\pi\gamma_{LV}} \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{3 \times 0.52 \, J.m^{-2} \times 33.51 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}^3}{2\pi \times 0.30 \, J.m^{-2}} \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{3 \times 0.52 \times 33.51 \times 10^{-15}}{2\pi \times 0.30} \]
\[ x^2 \approx \frac{50.112 \times 10^{-15}}{1.8849} \]
\[ x^2 \approx 26.58 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}^2 \]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[ x \approx \sqrt{26.58 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}^2} \]
\[ x \approx 5.15 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \]
\[ x \approx 0.515 \, \mu\text{m} \]

(A) $(SiO_4)^(-4)$ (B) $(Si_(2)O_(7))^(-6)$ (C) $(Si_(3)O_(10))^(-8)$ (D) $(Si_(4)O_(14))^(-10)$," To determine the most abundant anion in a \(2CaO.SiO_2\) melt, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the compound and the types of silicate anions that can form.

The compound \(2CaO.SiO_2\) can also be written as \(Ca_2SiO_4\), which indicates that for every two calcium cations (\(Ca^{2+}\)), there is one silicon atom and four oxygen atoms. This suggests that the silicon is in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen atoms, forming the orthosilicate anion, \((SiO_4)^{4-}\).

In silicate melts, silicon can form various anions depending on the degree of polymerization. The options given range from monomers to polymers of silicate tetrahedra:

(A) \((SiO_4)^{4-}\) - This is a monomer of a silicate tetrahedron, known as an orthosilicate.

(B) \((Si_2O_7)^{6-}\) - This is a dimer, known as a pyrosilicate, consisting of two silicate tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom.

(C) \((Si_3O_{10})^{8-}\) - This is a trimer, consisting of three silicate tetrahedra sharing two oxygen atoms.

(D) \((Si_4O_{14})^{10-}\) - This is a tetramer, consisting of four silicate tetrahedra sharing three oxygen atoms.

Given the stoichiometry of \(Ca_2SiO_4\), each silicon atom is associated with four oxygen atoms, which corresponds to the formula of the orthosilicate anion \((SiO_4)^{4-}\). There is no indication in the stoichiometry that silicate tetrahedra are sharing oxygen atoms to form dimers, trimers, or tetramers. Therefore, the most abundant anion in the melt would be the one that does not require sharing of oxygen atoms between silicate tetrahedra, which is the orthosilicate anion.

The correct answer is:

F = C - P + 1

For a three-component system (C = 3) at constant pressure, the modified phase rule becomes:

F = 3 - P + 1

At equilibrium, for a system to be stable, the number of degrees of freedom must be greater than or equal to zero (F ≥ 0). The maximum number of phases occurs when F = 0, which is the condition for a system with no degrees of freedom, known as an invariant system.

The excess free energy is the part of the free energy that is not accounted for by the ideal mixing behavior.

The molar free energy of the liquid solution is given by:

\[ G^L(T,x) = (1-x) \cdot [G_A]^{(0,L)} + x \cdot [G_B]^{(0,L)} + RT[x\ln x + (1-x)\ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x) \]

For an ideal solution, the free energy of mixing is given by the entropic term:

\[ G^{id}(T,x) = RT[x\ln x + (1-x)\ln(1-x)] \]

The excess molar free energy is then:

\[ G^{XS,L} = G^L(T,x) - G^{id}(T,x) \]

Substituting the expressions for $G^L(T,x)$ and $G^{id}(T,x)$ into the equation for $G^{XS,L}$, we get:

\[ G^{XS,L} = (1-x) \cdot [G_A]^{(0,L)} + x \cdot [G_B]^{(0,L)} + RT[x\ln x + (1-x)\ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x) - RT[x\ln x + (1-x)\ln(1-x)] \]

The entropic terms cancel out, leaving us with:

\[ G^{XS,L} = (1-x) \cdot [G_A]^{(0,L)} + x \cdot [G_B]^{(0,L)} + 4000x(1-x) \]

Given that $x = 0.5$ and $T = 1000 K$, we can calculate the excess molar free energy:

\[ G^{XS,L} = (1-0.5) \cdot [G_A]^{(0,L)} + 0.5 \cdot [G_B]^{(0,L)} + 4000 \cdot 0.5 \cdot (1-0.5) \]

Since we do not have the values for $[G_A]^{(0,L)}$ and $[G_B]^{(0,L)}$, we cannot calculate the exact numerical value for $G^{XS,L}$. However, we can simplify the expression:

\[ G^{XS,L} = 0.5 \cdot [G_A]^{(0,L)} + 0.5 \cdot [G_B]^{(0,L)} + 4000 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \]

\[ G^{XS,L} = 0.5 \cdot ([G_A]^{(0,L)} + [G_B]^{(0,L)}) + 1000 \]

The term $0.5 \cdot ([G_A]^{(0,L)} + [G_B]^{(0,L)})$ represents the average molar free energy of pure liquid A and pure liquid B at the given temperature. The excess term is the deviation from this average due to the interaction between A and B in the alloy. The constant term $1000$ comes from the $4000x(1-x)$ term when $x = 0.5$.

Since we cannot calculate the exact value without the values for $[G_A]^{(0,L)}$ and $[G_B]^{(0,L)}$, we cannot select an answer from the given options based on the information provided. However, we can say that the excess molar free energy includes a contribution of $1000$ J/mol from the $4000x(1-x)$ term at $x = 0.5$.

The energy barrier (ΔG*) for homogeneous nucleation can be expressed by the following equation:

ΔG* = 16πσ^3 / (3ΔG_v^2)

where:
- σ is the solid-liquid interfacial energy,
- ΔG_v is the change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume associated with the phase transformation from liquid to solid.

Given that the solid-liquid interfacial energy (σ) increases by 10%, we can denote the new interfacial energy as σ' = 1.10σ.

A spherical liquid metal droplet of diameter 1 mm is solidified in a stream of gas at 300 K. Assuming that the metal droplet remains at its melting point of 900 K and neglecting radiative losses, the time(in seconds to one decimal place) to complete the solidification is?"," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the liquid metal droplet to release its heat of fusion through the surface to the surrounding gas. We will use the following formula for the heat transfer rate:

\[ \text{Heat Transfer Rate} = h A \Delta T \]

where:
- \( h \) is the convective heat transfer coefficient (200 W/m²K),
- \( A \) is the surface area of the droplet,
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference between the droplet and the gas (900 K - 300 K = 600 K).

First, we need to calculate the surface area \( A \) of the spherical droplet:

\[ A = 4 \pi r^2 \]

Given the diameter of the droplet is 1 mm, the radius \( r \) is 0.5 mm or \( 0.5 \times 10^{-3} \) m. So:

\[ A = 4 \pi (0.5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})^2 \]
\[ A = 4 \pi (2.5 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^2) \]
\[ A = \pi (10^{-5} \text{ m}^2) \]
\[ A \approx 3.1416 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2 \]

Now, we can calculate the heat transfer rate:

\[ \text{Heat Transfer Rate} = (200 \text{ W/m}^2\text{K}) \times (3.1416 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2) \times (600 \text{ K}) \]
\[ \text{Heat Transfer Rate} \approx (200) \times (3.1416 \times 10^{-5}) \times (600) \text{ W} \]
\[ \text{Heat Transfer Rate} \approx 3.7699 \text{ W} \]

The total energy to be removed to solidify the droplet is the enthalpy of fusion times the mass of the droplet:

\[ \text{Total Energy} = \text{Enthalpy of Fusion} \times \text{Mass} \]

The mass of the droplet is given by its volume times its density:

\[ \text{Mass} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} \]
\[ \text{Mass} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \times \text{Density} \]
\[ \text{Mass} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})^3 \times (2700 \text{ kg/m}^3) \]
\[ \text{Mass} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (1.25 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^3) \times (2700 \text{ kg/m}^3) \]
\[ \text{Mass} = \pi (2.0 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^3) \times (2700 \text{ kg/m}^3) \]

Given that the vapor pressure of pure liquid Zn at 710 K is $p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0) = 3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ atm, we can use Raoult's law and the activity coefficient to find the vapor pressure of Zn in the alloy.

Raoult's law states that the partial vapor pressure of a component in a solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution. However, since we have an activity coefficient that is not equal to 1, we need to modify Raoult's law as follows:

\[ p_{Zn}(X_{Zn}) = \gamma_{Zn} \cdot X_{Zn} \cdot p_{Zn}^* \]

where $p_{Zn}^*$ is the vapor pressure of pure Zn, $\gamma_{Zn}$ is the activity coefficient of Zn, and $X_{Zn}$ is the mole fraction of Zn in the alloy.

For $X_{Zn} = 0.7$, we have:

\[ \ln(\gamma_{Zn}) = 0.875 \cdot (1 - X_{Zn})^2 \]
\[ \ln(\gamma_{Zn}) = 0.875 \cdot (1 - 0.7)^2 \]
\[ \ln(\gamma_{Zn}) = 0.875 \cdot (0.3)^2 \]
\[ \ln(\gamma_{Zn}) = 0.875 \cdot 0.09 \]
\[ \ln(\gamma_{Zn}) = 0.07875 \]
\[ \gamma_{Zn} = e^{0.07875} \]
\[ \gamma_{Zn} \approx 1.082 \]

Now we can calculate the vapor pressure of Zn in the alloy at $X_{Zn} = 0.7$:

\[ p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7) = \gamma_{Zn} \cdot X_{Zn} \cdot p_{Zn}^* \]
\[ p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7) = 1.082 \cdot 0.7 \cdot 3.6 \times 10^{-4} \]
\[ p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7) = 1.082 \cdot 2.52 \times 10^{-4} \]
\[ p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7) \approx 2.73 \times 10^{-4} \]

Now we have both vapor pressures:

\[ p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0) = 3.6 \times 10^{-4} \text{ atm} \]
\[ p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7) \approx 2.73 \times 10^{-4} \text{ atm} \]

The ratio of the two vapor pressures is:

\[ \frac{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7)}{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0)} = \frac{2.73 \times 10^{-4}}{3.6 \times 10^{-4}} \]
\[ \frac{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7)}{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0)} \approx 0.76 \]

The partial pressure of zinc(in torr, rounded off two decimal places) in equlibrium with liquid lead containing 0.03 mole % zinc at 900K is?"," To find the partial pressure of zinc in equilibrium with liquid lead containing 0.03 mole % zinc at 900K, we can use Henry's law, which states that the partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid phase.

Henry's law can be expressed as:

\[ p = x \cdot \gamma \]

where:
- \( p \) is the partial pressure of the solute (zinc in this case),
- \( x \) is the mole fraction of the solute in the solution,
- \( \gamma \) is the Henry's law coefficient.

First, we need to convert the mole percentage of zinc to mole fraction:

\[ x_{Zn} = \frac{\text{mole % of Zn}}{100} \]
\[ x_{Zn} = \frac{0.03}{100} \]
\[ x_{Zn} = 0.0003 \]

Now, we can use the given Henry's law coefficient \( \gamma_{Zb} \) for zinc in lead on the Raoultian scale, which is 8.55. Note that the subscript ""Zb"" likely indicates ""Zinc in Lead.""

Using Henry's law:

\[ p_{Zn} = x_{Zn} \cdot \gamma_{Zb} \]
\[ p_{Zn} = 0.0003 \cdot 8.55 \]
\[ p_{Zn} = 0.002565 \]

The partial pressure we calculated is in atmospheres. To convert it to torr, we use the conversion factor given in the question:

\[ 1 \text{ torr} = 1.316 \times 10^{-3} \text{ atm} \]
\[ p_{Zn} \text{ (in torr)} = p_{Zn} \text{ (in atm)} \times \frac{1}{1.316 \times 10^{-3}} \]
\[ p_{Zn} \text{ (in torr)} = 0.002565 \times \frac{1}{1.316 \times 10^{-3}} \]
\[ p_{Zn} \text{ (in torr)} = 1.95 \]

Rounded off to two decimal places, the partial pressure of zinc in equilibrium with liquid lead containing 0.03 mole % zinc at 900K is:

Cold working of iron leads to increase in dislocation density from $10^(10)$ to $10^(15)𝑚^(−2)$ . The associated stored energy (in 𝑴𝑱. $𝒎^(−𝟑)$, rounded off to one decimal place) is"," To calculate the associated stored energy due to an increase in dislocation density, we can use the following formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} G b^2 \Delta \rho \]

where:
- \( E \) is the stored energy per unit volume,
- \( G \) is the shear modulus,
- \( b \) is the magnitude of the Burgers vector,
- \( \Delta \rho \) is the change in dislocation density.

Given:
- Shear modulus of iron, \( G = 82 \) GPa \( = 82 \times 10^9 \) Pa (since 1 GPa \( = 10^9 \) Pa),
- Burgers vector, \( \vec{b} = \frac{a}{2}[111] \),
- Lattice constant, \( a = 0.2856 \) nm,
- Initial dislocation density, \( \rho_{\text{initial}} = 10^{10} \) m\( ^{-2} \),
- Final dislocation density, \( \rho_{\text{final}} = 10^{15} \) m\( ^{-2} \),
- \( \Delta \rho = \rho_{\text{final}} - \rho_{\text{initial}} \).

First, we need to calculate the magnitude of the Burgers vector:

\[ b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \]
\[ b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 0.2856 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m} \]
\[ b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 2.856 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} \]
\[ b \approx 0.491 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m} \]

Now, we calculate the change in dislocation density:

\[ \Delta \rho = 10^{15} - 10^{10} \approx 10^{15} \text{ m}^{-2} \]

Since the initial dislocation density is much smaller than the final density, we can approximate \( \Delta \rho \) to \( 10^{15} \) m\( ^{-2} \).

Now we can calculate the stored energy:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} G b^2 \Delta \rho \]
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 82 \times 10^9 \times (0.491 \times 10^{-9})^2 \times 10^{15} \]

In the case of burning propane (C3H8) with a stoichiometric amount of oxygen, the maximum temperature is reached when all the reactants are converted into products (CO2 and H2O), and there is no excess of either reactant.

When excess oxygen is added to the reaction, the additional oxygen does not react because the reaction is already complete (assuming perfect combustion). The excess oxygen will not combust and will not contribute to the energy released during the reaction. Instead, the excess oxygen will act as a diluent, absorbing some of the heat released by the combustion and lowering the adiabatic flame temperature.

(C) 4 hours. (D) 16 hours. "," To solve this problem, we can use the concept of thermal diffusivity, which is given by the formula:

\[ \alpha = \frac{k}{\rho c} \]

where:
- \( \alpha \) is the thermal diffusivity (m²/s),
- \( k \) is the thermal conductivity (W/mK),
- \( \rho \) is the density (kg/m³),
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity (J/kgK).

Thermal diffusivity is a measure of the rate at which heat diffuses through a material. The time required for heat to diffuse a certain distance is proportional to the square of the distance divided by the thermal diffusivity.

Given that the spheres X and Y have different thermal diffusivities and that they are identical in diameter, we can assume that the heat transfer process is governed by a one-dimensional heat equation in the radial direction for both spheres.

The time \( t \) it takes for the center of a sphere to reach a certain temperature is related to the thermal diffusivity \( \alpha \) by the relationship:

\[ t \propto \frac{r^2}{\alpha} \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

Since the spheres X and Y have the same diameter (and hence the same radius), and they are both heated under the same conditions, the only difference affecting the time to reach the center temperature is their thermal diffusivities.

Let \( t_X \) be the time it takes for sphere X to reach 800K at its center, and \( t_Y \) be the time it takes for sphere Y to reach the same temperature at its center. We can write:

\[ \frac{t_Y}{t_X} = \frac{\alpha_X}{\alpha_Y} \]

Given that \( t_X = 1 \) hour and \( \alpha_X = 100 \times 10^{-6} \) m²/s, and \( \alpha_Y = 25 \times 10^{-6} \) m²/s, we can calculate \( t_Y \):

\[ t_Y = t_X \times \frac{\alpha_X}{\alpha_Y} \]
\[ t_Y = 1 \text{ hour} \times \frac{100 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2/\text{s}}{25 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2/\text{s}} \]
\[ t_Y = 1 \text{ hour} \times 4 \]
\[ t_Y = 4 \text{ hours} \]

(A) 25 (B) 38 (C) 62 (D) 75"," To solve this problem, we need to use the lever rule, which is a method for determining the proportions of phases in a solid-liquid equilibrium in a binary phase diagram. The lever rule states that the weight fraction of a phase is proportional to the length of the lever arm opposite that phase's side of the phase diagram.

Given that we have a Mg-Sn phase diagram with a eutectic reaction at 561°C:

L (36.9 wt.% Sn) → α (14.48 wt.% Sn) + Mg2Sn

We are interested in the alloy composition of Mg-50 wt.% Sn, which is richer in Sn than the eutectic composition (36.9 wt.% Sn). Since the temperature is just below 561°C, the alloy will consist of the α phase and the eutectic mixture.

To find the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy, we apply the lever rule:

Amount of eutectic = (Composition of α - Composition of alloy) / (Composition of α - Composition of eutectic) * 100

Plugging in the values:

Amount of eutectic = (14.48 wt.% Sn - 50 wt.% Sn) / (14.48 wt.% Sn - 36.9 wt.% Sn) * 100

Amount of eutectic = (-35.52 wt.% Sn) / (14.48 wt.% Sn - 36.9 wt.% Sn) * 100

Amount of eutectic = (-35.52 wt.% Sn) / (-22.42 wt.% Sn) * 100

Amount of eutectic = (50 wt.% Sn - 14.48 wt.% Sn) / (36.9 wt.% Sn - 14.48 wt.% Sn) * 100

Amount of eutectic = (35.52 wt.% Sn) / (22.42 wt.% Sn) * 100

Amount of eutectic ≈ 1.58 * 100

Amount of eutectic ≈ 158%

This is still incorrect. Let's try the calculation again with the correct approach:

Amount of eutectic = (Composition of alloy - Composition of α) / (Composition of eutectic - Composition of α) * 100

Amount of eutectic = (50 wt.% Sn - 14.48 wt.% Sn) / (36.9 wt.% Sn - 14.48 wt.% Sn) * 100

Amount of eutectic = (35.52 wt.% Sn) / (22.42 wt.% Sn) * 100

(B) Both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a]. (C) Both [a] and [r] are false.  (D) [a] is true but [r] is false. "," To answer this question, let's analyze both the Assertion [a] and the Reason [r] separately and then determine their relationship.

Assertion [a]: Low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often have additions of strong carbide-forming elements.

This assertion is true. Low alloy steels are designed to have improved strength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures compared to plain carbon steels. To achieve this, they often contain additions of elements such as chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, and niobium, which are strong carbide formers. These elements form carbides that are stable at high temperatures and help to prevent grain boundary sliding, which is one of the mechanisms of creep deformation.

Reason [r]: During creep deformation, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix, lose coherency.

This reason is also true. In materials science, the term ""misfit"" refers to the difference in lattice parameters between the matrix (the base metal) and the precipitate particles (like carbides). When the misfit is high, the stress at the interface between the matrix and the particles increases, especially under the influence of external stress and high temperatures. As a result, these particles can lose coherency with the matrix, which means the atomic arrangement at the interface becomes disordered. This loss of coherency can lead to the formation of voids or cracks at the particle/matrix interface, which can accelerate creep deformation.

Now, let's determine the relationship between the Assertion [a] and the Reason [r]:

The addition of strong carbide-forming elements in low alloy steels is indeed to improve creep resistance. The presence of these carbides does lead to a misfit with the matrix, and during creep, these particles can lose coherency, especially if the misfit is large. However, the goal of adding carbide-forming elements is not just to create particles that will lose coherency; rather, it is to create a dispersion of fine, thermally stable carbides that can pin grain boundaries and dislocations, thereby impeding creep deformation. The loss of coherency is more of a consequence that can occur during creep, rather than the primary reason for the addition of these elements.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a].

(A) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$ (B) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ > $X_B$ (C) If $ΔH_(mix)$ > 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$ (D) If $ΔH_(mix)$ < 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$"," To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the mixing enthalpy ($ΔH_(mix)$), the activity of a component in a solution ($a_B$), and its mole fraction ($X_B$).

The activity of a component in a solution is a measure of its ""effective concentration"" for the purposes of calculating its contribution to the properties of the solution, such as its partial pressure or its chemical potential. The activity is related to the mole fraction by the activity coefficient ($γ_B$):

\[ a_B = γ_B \cdot X_B \]

The activity coefficient can be less than, greater than, or equal to 1, depending on the interactions between the components in the solution.

Now, let's consider the given options:

(A) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$
This would imply that the activity coefficient $γ_B$ is less than 1. A zero mixing enthalpy suggests that there are no energetic interactions between A and B that are different from the interactions within pure A and pure B. In an ideal solution, where $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, the activity coefficient is indeed equal to 1, and thus $a_B$ = $X_B$. However, in a real solution, even if $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, there could be non-idealities due to entropy effects, leading to $γ_B$ ≠ 1. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.

(B) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ > $X_B$
This would imply that the activity coefficient $γ_B$ is greater than 1. As explained above, for an ideal solution with $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, $γ_B$ should be equal to 1, not greater. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(C) If $ΔH_(mix)$ > 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$
A positive mixing enthalpy ($ΔH_(mix)$ > 0) indicates that the solution process is endothermic, which typically means that the interactions between A and B are less favorable than the interactions within pure A and pure B. This usually leads to a lowering of the vapor pressure and a decrease in the activity of B compared to its mole fraction, meaning $γ_B$ < 1 and $a_B$ < $X_B$. This option is generally true.

(D) If $ΔH_(mix)$ < 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$
A negative mixing enthalpy ($ΔH_(mix)$ < 0) indicates that the solution process is exothermic, which typically means that the interactions between A and B are more favorable than the interactions within pure A and pure B. This usually leads to an increase in the vapor pressure and an increase in the activity of B compared to its mole fraction, meaning $γ_B$ > 1 and $a_B$ > $X_B$. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is:

- (C) If $ΔH_(mix)$ > 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$

(D) Rate of reaction depends on temperature"," To solve the question regarding a zeroth order chemical reaction, let's analyze each statement:

(A) Concentration versus time plot is a straight line.
- This is TRUE. For a zeroth order reaction, the rate of reaction is constant, and thus, the concentration of the reactant decreases linearly over time, resulting in a straight line on a concentration versus time plot.

(B) Increase in concentration of reacting species increases the rate of reaction.
- This is FALSE. For a zeroth order reaction, the rate of reaction does not depend on the concentration of the reactants. Instead, it is solely determined by the rate constant.

(C) Half-life depends on the initial concentration and zero-order rate constant.

For a given undercooling, if surface energy of a nucleus increases by 20%, the corresponding increase(in percent) in the critical radius of the nucleus is?(round off to nearest integer)"," To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between surface energy, critical radius, and undercooling in the context of homogenous nucleation. The critical radius (\(r^*\)) of a nucleus is the size at which the nucleus is in unstable equilibrium between growing and shrinking. This critical radius is determined by the balance of the volume free energy change and the surface free energy change when a solid nucleus forms from a liquid.

The Gibbs free energy change (\(\Delta G\)) associated with the formation of a spherical nucleus of radius \(r\) can be expressed as:

\[\Delta G = -\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \Delta G_v + 4\pi r^2 \gamma\]

where:
- \(\Delta G_v\) is the free energy change per unit volume of the new phase (which is related to the undercooling),
- \(\gamma\) is the surface energy per unit area between the nucleus and the liquid.

The critical radius \(r^*\) is found by setting the derivative of \(\Delta G\) with respect to \(r\) equal to zero, which gives us:

\[\frac{d(\Delta G)}{dr} = -4\pi r^{*2} \Delta G_v + 8\pi r^* \gamma = 0\]

Solving for \(r^*\), we get:

\[r^* = \frac{2\gamma}{\Delta G_v}\]

Now, if the surface energy \(\gamma\) increases by 20%, the new surface energy \(\gamma'\) becomes:

\[\gamma' = \gamma + 0.20\gamma = 1.20\gamma\]

The new critical radius \(r'^*\) with the increased surface energy is:

\[r'^* = \frac{2\gamma'}{\Delta G_v} = \frac{2 \cdot 1.20\gamma}{\Delta G_v} = 1.20 \cdot \frac{2\gamma}{\Delta G_v} = 1.20r^*\]

To find the percentage increase in the critical radius, we calculate:

\[\text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{r'^* - r^*}{r^*}\right) \times 100\%\]

Substituting \(r'^* = 1.20r^*\) into the equation, we get:

\[\text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{1.20r^* - r^*}{r^*}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{0.20r^*}{r^*}\right) \times 100\% = 20\%\]

Therefore, if the surface energy of a nucleus increases by 20%, the corresponding increase in the critical radius of the nucleus is also 20%.

F = C - P + 2

where:
- F is the number of degrees of freedom (the number of independent variables such as temperature, pressure, and concentration that can be varied without changing the number of phases).
- C is the number of components (independent chemical species).
- P is the number of phases (solid, liquid, gas).

For the reaction:

M(s) + CO2(g) = MO(s) + CO(g)

We have:
- 2 solid phases (M(s) and MO(s))
- 2 gas phases (CO2(g) and CO(g))

So, P = 2 (since solids and gases are considered as separate phases).

For the components (C), we need to consider the minimum number of independent species that can be used to express the composition of all the phases present. In this reaction, we have two solids and two gases, but they are not all independent due to the stoichiometric constraints of the reaction. We can choose CO2(g) and CO(g) as the components since the solids M(s) and MO(s) can be derived from these gases through the reaction. Therefore, C = 2.

Now, we can calculate the degrees of freedom (F):

F = C - P + 2
F = 2 - 2 + 2
F = 2

Thus, the number of degrees of freedom for the given reacting system is 2.

The enthalpy of mixing, $ΔH_(mix)$, indicates the energy change when two substances are mixed to form a solution. A binary phase diagram shows the phases present in a two-component system as a function of temperature and composition.

Here are the implications of the different conditions:

- If $ΔH_(mix)^(solid) = 0$ and $ΔH_(mix)^(liquid) = 0$, this means that there is no energy change when the components A and B are mixed in either the solid or liquid state. This would typically lead to an ideal solution in both phases, and the phase diagram would show complete solid solubility and complete liquid miscibility without any minima or maxima in the liquidus or solidus lines.

- If $ΔH_(mix)^(solid) << 0$ (much less than zero), this indicates that the mixing of A and B in the solid state is exothermic, and there is a strong attraction between the different types of atoms or molecules. This can lead to the formation of intermetallic compounds or ordered structures in the solid state, which can result in a more complex phase diagram with intermediate phases.

- If $ΔH_(mix)^(solid) > 0$, this means that the mixing of A and B in the solid state is endothermic, and there is a repulsive interaction between the different types of atoms or molecules. This typically leads to limited solid solubility, and the phase diagram would show a eutectic or peritectic behavior with immiscibility in the solid state.

- If $ΔH_(mix)^(liquid) << 0$, this indicates that the mixing of A and B in the liquid state is highly exothermic, which can lead to a negative deviation from Raoult's law and possibly a minimum boiling azeotrope or a liquid with limited miscibility.

Given the options and the typical features of a binary phase diagram, we can deduce the following:

- Option (A) suggests that there is no enthalpy change for mixing in either phase, which would lead to a simple phase diagram with complete solid solubility and a straight liquidus line.

- Option (B) suggests that there is a strong exothermic interaction in the solid state but no enthalpy change in the liquid state. This could lead to the formation of intermetallic compounds or ordered structures in the solid state, but the liquid phase would behave ideally.

- Option (C) suggests that there is an endothermic interaction in the solid state but no enthalpy change in the liquid state. This would typically lead to limited solid solubility and possibly a eutectic or peritectic system.

- Option (D) suggests that there is no enthalpy change for mixing in the solid state but a strong exothermic interaction in the liquid state. This could lead to a complex liquid phase behavior, such as a minimum boiling azeotrope or limited miscibility in the liquid state, but the solid phase would behave ideally.

Thermodynamics,88,G-META-21-54,NUM,44,Assume: Weight gain is proportional to square root of time. Nickel undergoes isothermal oxidation at 800K for a duration of 400s resulting in a weight gain of 2mg $cm^(2)$. The weight gain (mg $cm^2$) after a duration of 1600s is?(round off to nearest integer). ," Given that the weight gain is proportional to the square root of time, we can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ W(t) = k \sqrt{t} \]

where \( W(t) \) is the weight gain as a function of time \( t \), and \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

We are given that after 400 seconds, the weight gain \( W(400) \) is 2 mg \( cm^{-2} \). We can use this information to solve for \( k \):

\[ 2 = k \sqrt{400} \]
\[ k = \frac{2}{\sqrt{400}} \]
\[ k = \frac{2}{20} \]
\[ k = 0.1 \]

Now we want to find the weight gain after 1600 seconds, \( W(1600) \):

\[ W(1600) = k \sqrt{1600} \]
\[ W(1600) = 0.1 \times 40 \]
\[ W(1600) = 4 \]

So, after a duration of 1600 seconds, the weight gain is 4 mg \( cm^{-2} \). Rounded off to the nearest integer, this value remains 4.

(A) Among all radiation emitted by an ideal black body at room temperature, the most intense radiation falls in the visible light spectrum.
- This statement is FALSE. For an ideal black body at room temperature (around 300 K), the peak of the emitted radiation is actually in the infrared range, not in the visible light spectrum. The visible spectrum is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the peak intensity for room temperature black bodies is at longer wavelengths than visible light.

(B) The total emissive power of an ideal black body is proportional to the square of its absolute temperature.
- This statement is FALSE. The total emissive power of an ideal black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the total energy emitted per unit surface area of a black body per unit time (the emissive power) is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature, not the square. The law is expressed as \( P = \sigma T^4 \), where \( P \) is the total emissive power, \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the absolute temperature.

(C) The emissive power of an ideal black body peaks at a wavelength λ which is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature.
- This statement is TRUE. Wien's displacement law states that the wavelength at which the emission of a black body is strongest (the peak emission) is inversely proportional to the temperature. This can be expressed as \( \lambda_{max} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( \lambda_{max} \) is the peak wavelength, \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant, and \( T \) is the absolute temperature. As the temperature increases, the peak wavelength decreases, and vice versa.

(D) The radiant energy emitted by an ideal black body is greater than that emitted by the non-black body at all temperatures above 0 K.
- This statement is TRUE. By definition, an ideal black body is a perfect emitter and absorber of radiation. It emits the maximum amount of thermal radiation at a given temperature than any other body. Real objects, known as gray bodies, have emissivities less than 1 and thus emit less radiation than an ideal black body at the same temperature.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer(s) is(are):

- (C) The emissive power of an ideal black body peaks at a wavelength λ which is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature.
- (D) The radiant energy emitted by an ideal black body is greater than that emitted by the non-black body at all temperatures above 0 K.

Thermodynamics,91,G-META-13-2,MCQS,27,"As the concentration of point defects in a crystal increases, its configurational entropy  (A) does not change (B) decreases (C) increases (D) initially increases and then decreases"," The correct answer to the question is:

(C) increases

Explanation: Configurational entropy is a measure of the disorder within a system. In a crystal, point defects such as vacancies, interstitials, and substitutional impurities contribute to the disorder because they disrupt the perfect periodic arrangement of atoms or ions. As the concentration of these point defects increases, the number of ways to arrange the defects within the crystal also increases, leading to a higher configurational entropy. This is consistent with the principles of thermodynamics, where systems tend to move towards configurations with higher entropy to maximize the overall entropy of the system. Therefore, as the concentration of point defects in a crystal increases, the configurational entropy of the crystal also increases.

What is the change in the enthalpy of pure iron (in J/mol) when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C?," To find the change in enthalpy (ΔH) when pure iron is heated from 25°C to 700°C, we need to integrate the specific heat capacity function with respect to temperature over the temperature range.

Given the specific heat capacity function:
\[ C_p = 17.49 + 24.77 \times 10^{-3} \times T \]

First, convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:
\[ T_{initial} = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \text{ K} \]
\[ T_{final} = 700 + 273.15 = 973.15 \text{ K} \]

Now, integrate the specific heat capacity function from \( T_{initial} \) to \( T_{final} \) to find ΔH:

\[ ΔH = \int_{T_{initial}}^{T_{final}} C_p \, dT \]
\[ ΔH = \int_{T_{initial}}^{T_{final}} (17.49 + 24.77 \times 10^{-3} \times T) \, dT \]

\[ ΔH = \left[ 17.49T + \frac{24.77 \times 10^{-3}}{2}T^2 \right]_{T_{initial}}^{T_{final}} \]

\[ ΔH = \left[ 17.49T + 12.385 \times 10^{-3}T^2 \right]_{298.15}^{973.15} \]

Now, evaluate the expression at the initial and final temperatures and subtract:

\[ ΔH = \left( 17.49 \times 973.15 + 12.385 \times 10^{-3} \times (973.15)^2 \right) - \left( 17.49 \times 298.15 + 12.385 \times 10^{-3} \times (298.15)^2 \right) \]

The equilibrium ratio, $𝑝_(C0_2)$/ $𝑝_(CO)$ for the reaction at 1200 K and 1 atm is ?"," To find the equilibrium ratio \( \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}} \) for the reaction at 1200 K, we can use the Gibbs free energy change \( \Delta G^\circ_{1200} \) and the relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change and the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) given by:

\[ \Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K_p \]

where \( R \) is the gas constant (8.314 J \( mol^{-1}K^{-1} \)), \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin, and \( K_p \) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction expressed in terms of partial pressures.

Given:
\[ \Delta G^\circ_{1200} = -8000 \text{ joules per mole of CO} \]
\[ T = 1200 \text{ K} \]
\[ R = 8.314 \text{ J} \ mol^{-1}K^{-1} \]

First, we solve for \( K_p \):

\[ -8000 \text{ J/mol} = -(8.314 \text{ J} \ mol^{-1}K^{-1})(1200 \text{ K}) \ln K_p \]

\[ \ln K_p = \frac{-8000 \text{ J/mol}}{-(8.314 \text{ J} \ mol^{-1}K^{-1})(1200 \text{ K})} \]

\[ \ln K_p = \frac{8000}{8.314 \times 1200} \]

\[ \ln K_p = \frac{8000}{9976.8} \]

\[ \ln K_p \approx 0.8013 \]

\[ K_p = e^{0.8013} \]

\[ K_p \approx 2.225 \]

Now, we can express \( K_p \) in terms of the partial pressures of CO and CO2, since the reaction stoichiometry indicates that 1 mole of CO produces 1 mole of CO2:

\[ K_p = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}} \]

Given that the initial pressure of CO is 1 atm, and assuming that the reaction goes to equilibrium, the partial pressure of CO2 at equilibrium will be equal to the partial pressure of CO consumed (since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 for CO and CO2). Therefore, at equilibrium, the partial pressure of CO2 will also be 1 atm if the reaction goes to completion, which is not typically the case for a real reaction at equilibrium. However, for the purpose of this calculation, we will use the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) to determine the ratio of the partial pressures.

Since \( K_p \) is approximately 2.225 and the partial pressure of CO is 1 atm, the partial pressure of CO2 at equilibrium would be:

\[ 2.225 = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{1 \text{ atm}} \]

\[ p_{CO_2} = 2.225 \text{ atm} \]

However, this result does not make sense given the stoichiometry of the reaction and the fact that the initial pressure of CO was 1 atm. The equilibrium constant \( K_p \) should be dimensionless, and the partial pressures should be raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. The correct expression for \( K_p \) should be:

\[ K_p = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}} \]

Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 for CO and CO2, the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) directly gives us the ratio of the partial pressures:

\[ K_p = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}} = 2.225 \]

Given that the initial pressure of CO is 1 atm, the equilibrium partial pressure of CO2 will be:

\[ p_{CO_2} = K_p \times p_{CO} \]

\[ p_{CO_2} = 2.225 \times 1 \text{ atm} \]

\[ p_{CO_2} = 2.225 \text{ atm} \]

On the other hand, if the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, the free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for solidification is ?"," To solve this problem, we can use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which relates the free energy change (ΔG) to the enthalpy change (ΔH), temperature (T), and entropy change (ΔS) for a process:

\[ \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \]

For the solidification of a metal, ΔH is the enthalpy of fusion (heat of fusion), which is typically constant over small temperature ranges, and ΔS is the entropy of fusion, which also remains relatively constant.

Given that at the melting point (T_m = 1356 K), the free energy change for solidification is 0 (because the solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium), we can write:

\[ 0 = \Delta H - T_m \Delta S \]
\[ \Delta H = T_m \Delta S \]

At the undercooled temperature of 1256 K, we have:

\[ \Delta G_{1256} = \Delta H - 1256 \Delta S \]
\[ -1000 = \Delta H - 1256 \Delta S \]

We can now express ΔH in terms of T_m and ΔS:

\[ -1000 = T_m \Delta S - 1256 \Delta S \]
\[ -1000 = (1356 - 1256) \Delta S \]
\[ -1000 = 100 \Delta S \]
\[ \Delta S = -\frac{1000}{100} \]
\[ \Delta S = -10 \, \text{J mol}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1} \]

Now, we want to find ΔG at 1200 K:

\[ \Delta G_{1200} = \Delta H - 1200 \Delta S \]
\[ \Delta G_{1200} = T_m \Delta S - 1200 \Delta S \]
\[ \Delta G_{1200} = 1356 \Delta S - 1200 \Delta S \]
\[ \Delta G_{1200} = (1356 - 1200) \Delta S \]
\[ \Delta G_{1200} = 156 \Delta S \]

Substituting the value of ΔS we found:

\[ \Delta G_{1200} = 156 \times (-10) \]
\[ \Delta G_{1200} = -1560 \, \text{J mol}^{-1} \]

So, the free energy change for solidification at 1200 K is -1560 J mol⁻¹.

Given that the latent heat of fusion is 3 × $10^(5) J $kg^(-1)$ and the total rate of heat removal by the mould is 4.2 × $10^6$ W, the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is?"," To solve this problem, we need to determine the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit. We have the following information:

- The total mass flow rate of metal (solid and liquid) is 35 kg/s.
- The latent heat of fusion for the metal is \(3 \times 10^5\) J/kg.
- The total rate of heat removal by the mould is \(4.2 \times 10^6\) W.

The mass fraction of solid at the mould exit can be found by equating the rate of heat removal to the rate of heat required to melt the metal (which is the same as the rate of heat released during solidification, but with the opposite sign).

Let \( \dot{m}_{solid} \) be the mass flow rate of the solid metal, and \( \dot{m}_{liquid} \) be the mass flow rate of the liquid metal. The total mass flow rate is the sum of these two:

\[ \dot{m}_{total} = \dot{m}_{solid} + \dot{m}_{liquid} \]

Given that \( \dot{m}_{total} = 35 \) kg/s, we can express \( \dot{m}_{liquid} \) as:

\[ \dot{m}_{liquid} = \dot{m}_{total} - \dot{m}_{solid} \]

The rate of heat removal is equal to the rate of heat required to solidify the liquid metal:

\[ \dot{Q} = \dot{m}_{solid} \cdot L \]

where \( L \) is the latent heat of fusion. We know that \( \dot{Q} = 4.2 \times 10^6 \) W and \( L = 3 \times 10^5 \) J/kg, so we can solve for \( \dot{m}_{solid} \):

\[ 4.2 \times 10^6 = \dot{m}_{solid} \cdot 3 \times 10^5 \]

\[ \dot{m}_{solid} = \frac{4.2 \times 10^6}{3 \times 10^5} \]

\[ \dot{m}_{solid} = 14 \text{ kg/s} \]

Now that we have \( \dot{m}_{solid} \), we can find the mass fraction of solid, which is the ratio of the mass flow rate of solid to the total mass flow rate:

\[ \text{Mass fraction of solid} = \frac{\dot{m}_{solid}}{\dot{m}_{total}} \]

\[ \text{Mass fraction of solid} = \frac{14}{35} \]

\[ \text{Mass fraction of solid} = \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ \text{Mass fraction of solid} = 0.4 \]

The mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is 0.4.

Given that the activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution in Fe is $10^(-3)$, the standard Gibbs free energy change (in kJ) for this equilibrium is?"," To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the activity of a component in a solution and the standard Gibbs free energy change for a reaction or process. The activity of a component in a solution is related to its concentration and the activity coefficient.

For the process given in the question:

\[ \text{Si (liq.)} = \text{Si (1 wt.\% in Fe)} \]

The change in standard Gibbs free energy (\( \Delta G^\circ \)) for this process can be calculated using the following equation:

\[ \Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K \]

where:
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin (1873 K in this case),
- \( K \) is the equilibrium constant for the process.

Since we are dealing with the change in standard state from pure liquid Si to 1 wt.% Si in liquid Fe, we can consider the activity of pure liquid Si to be 1 (by definition of standard state). The activity of Si in the 1 wt.% solution is equal to the product of its concentration (in this case, the weight percentage) and its activity coefficient at that concentration.

At infinite dilution, the activity coefficient (\( \gamma \)) of Si in Fe is given as \( 10^{-3} \). However, we need to consider the activity coefficient at the actual concentration of interest, which is 1 wt.%. Since the activity coefficient at infinite dilution is often a limiting value, we might not have enough information to directly calculate the activity coefficient at 1 wt.% without additional data. However, for the purpose of this problem, we will assume that the activity coefficient remains relatively constant and use the given value.

The activity (\( a \)) of Si at 1 wt.% can be approximated as:

\[ a_{\text{Si}} = \gamma_{\text{Si}} \cdot X_{\text{Si}} \]

where \( X_{\text{Si}} \) is the mole fraction of Si, which we need to calculate from the weight percentage. Assuming that the density of the Fe-Si solution does not change significantly with the addition of 1 wt.% Si, we can approximate the mole fraction using the atomic weights of Si (28.085 g/mol) and Fe (55.845 g/mol):

\[ X_{\text{Si}} = \frac{\frac{1 \text{ wt.\%}}{28.085 \text{ g/mol}}}{\frac{1 \text{ wt.\%}}{28.085 \text{ g/mol}} + \frac{99 \text{ wt.\%}}{55.845 \text{ g/mol}}} \]

\[ X_{\text{Si}} = \frac{\frac{1}{28.085}}{\frac{1}{28.085} + \frac{99}{55.845}} \]

\[ X_{\text{Si}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{28.085 \cdot 99}{55.845}} \]

\[ X_{\text{Si}} = \frac{1}{1 + 4.997} \]

\[ X_{\text{Si}} \approx \frac{1}{5.997} \]

\[ X_{\text{Si}} \approx 0.1667 \]

Now, we can calculate the activity of Si at 1 wt.%:

\[ a_{\text{Si}} = \gamma_{\text{Si}} \cdot X_{\text{Si}} \]

\[ a_{\text{Si}} = 10^{-3} \cdot 0.1667 \]

\[ a_{\text{Si}} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4} \]

The equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction is the ratio of the activities of the products to the activities of the reactants, which in this case is simply the activity of Si in the 1 wt.% solution since the activity of pure liquid Si is 1:

\[ K = \frac{a_{\text{Si (1 wt.\%)}}}{a_{\text{Si (liq.)}}} \]

\[ K = a_{\text{Si (1 wt.\%)}} \]

\[ K \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4} \]

1. **Radiative Heat Transfer:**

The rate of heat transfer by radiation can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[ q_{\text{rad}} = \epsilon \sigma A (T^4 - T_{\text{surr}}^4) \]

where:
- \( \epsilon \) is the emissivity of the material (steel in this case),
- \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,
- \( A \) is the surface area through which heat is transferred,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature of the object (steel slab),

- \( A \) is the surface area through which heat is transferred,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature of the object (steel slab),

Given:
- \( h = 4.6 \, W.m^{-2}.K^{-1} \),
- \( A = 1 \, m^2 \),
- \( T = 1298 \, K \),
- \( T_{\text{surr}} = 298 \, K \).

Plugging in the values:

\[ q_{\text{conv}} = 4.6 \, W.m^{-2}.K^{-1} \times 1 \, m^2 \times (1298 \, K - 298 \, K) \]

\[ q_{\text{conv}} = 4.6 \, W.m^{-2}.K^{-1} \times 1000 \, K \]

\[ q_{\text{conv}} = 4600 \, W \]

\[ q_{\text{conv}} = 4.6 \, kW \]

The melting point of the base material is 1500 K. The width(in mm to two decimal places) of the fusion zone is?," To find the width of the fusion zone, we need to determine the values of \( x \) where the temperature profile \( T = 2000 \cdot \exp(-0.3 \cdot x^2) \) equals the melting point of the base material, which is 1500 K.

Let's set the temperature equation equal to the melting point and solve for \( x \):

\[ 1500 = 2000 \cdot \exp(-0.3 \cdot x^2) \]

Divide both sides by 2000:

\[ \frac{1500}{2000} = \exp(-0.3 \cdot x^2) \]

\[ 0.75 = \exp(-0.3 \cdot x^2) \]

Now, take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \( x^2 \):

\[ \ln(0.75) = -0.3 \cdot x^2 \]

\[ x^2 = -\frac{\ln(0.75)}{0.3} \]

\[ x^2 = -\frac{\ln(3/4)}{0.3} \]

\[ x^2 = -\frac{\ln(3) - \ln(4)}{0.3} \]

\[ x^2 = \frac{\ln(4) - \ln(3)}{0.3} \]

Now, calculate the value of \( x^2 \):

\[ x^2 = \frac{\ln(4/3)}{0.3} \]

\[ x^2 \approx \frac{0.2877}{0.3} \]

\[ x^2 \approx 0.9590 \]

Now, find \( x \) by taking the square root of both sides:

\[ x \approx \sqrt{0.9590} \]

\[ x \approx \pm 0.9796 \]

Since we are looking for the width of the fusion zone, we need the positive value of \( x \) (since distance cannot be negative). The width of the fusion zone is twice the value of \( x \) because the temperature profile is symmetric about the weld center:

\[ \text{Width} = 2 \cdot x \]

\[ \text{Width} \approx 2 \cdot 0.9796 \]

\[ \text{Width} \approx 1.9592 \]

So, the width of the fusion zone to two decimal places is approximately 1.96 mm.

Here is the correct answer in a list:

- Width of the fusion zone: 1.96 mm",,,0,

Given: Gas constant R = 8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$"," To calculate the total entropy of mixing for an ideal solid solution, we can use the following formula:

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = -nR(x_{Au} \ln x_{Au} + x_{Ag} \ln x_{Ag}) \]

where:
- \( \Delta S_{mix} \) is the entropy of mixing,
- \( n \) is the total number of moles of the components,
- \( x_{Au} \) and \( x_{Ag} \) are the mole fractions of Au and Ag, respectively,
- \( R \) is the gas constant (8.314 J \(K^{-1}mol^{-1}\)).

First, we need to calculate the mole fractions of Au and Ag:

\[ x_{Au} = \frac{n_{Au}}{n_{Au} + n_{Ag}} = \frac{2}{2 + 3} = \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ x_{Ag} = \frac{n_{Ag}}{n_{Au} + n_{Ag}} = \frac{3}{2 + 3} = \frac{3}{5} \]

Now we can plug these values into the entropy of mixing formula:

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = -(2 + 3) \times 8.314 \left( \frac{2}{5} \ln \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{5} \ln \frac{3}{5} \right) \]

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = -5 \times 8.314 \left( \frac{2}{5} \ln \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{5} \ln \frac{3}{5} \right) \]

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = -41.57 \left( \frac{2}{5} \ln \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{5} \ln \frac{3}{5} \right) \]

Now we calculate the natural logarithms and the rest of the expression:

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = -41.57 \left( \frac{2}{5} \ln 0.4 + \frac{3}{5} \ln 0.6 \right) \]

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = -41.57 \left( \frac{2}{5} (-0.916) + \frac{3}{5} (-0.5108) \right) \]

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = -41.57 \left( -0.3664 - 0.3065 \right) \]

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = -41.57 \left( -0.6729 \right) \]

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = 27.972738 \]

Rounded off to one decimal place, the total entropy of mixing is:

\[ \Delta S_{mix} = 28.0 \text{ J K}^{-1} \]

So the final answer is:

For the reaction: 4Ag(s, pure) + $O_2$(g) ⟶ $2Ag_(2)O$(s, pure), the standard enthalpy change, ∆𝐻° = − 61080 J, and the standard entropy change, ∆𝑆° = − 132.22 J $K^(−1)$ , in the temperature range from 298 K to 500 K. The temperature(in K to one decimal place). above which $Ag_(2)O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm is?"," To determine the temperature above which \( Ag_2O \) decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure of \( p_{O_2} = 0.3 \) atm, we need to consider the Gibbs free energy change \( \Delta G \) for the reaction. The decomposition of \( Ag_2O \) will occur spontaneously when \( \Delta G \) is negative.

The Gibbs free energy change is given by:

\[ \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S \]

Where:
- \( \Delta H \) is the standard enthalpy change,
- \( \Delta S \) is the standard entropy change,
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given:
- \( \Delta H^\circ = -61080 \) J,
- \( \Delta S^\circ = -132.22 \) J/K,
- \( R = 8.314 \) J/(mol·K).

For the decomposition of \( Ag_2O \) to be spontaneous, \( \Delta G \) must be less than zero:

\[ \Delta G < 0 \]

Substituting \( \Delta H \) and \( \Delta S \) into the equation for \( \Delta G \), we get:

\[ \Delta G = (-61080 \text{ J}) - T(-132.22 \text{ J/K}) \]

We want to find the temperature \( T \) at which \( \Delta G = 0 \), as this will be the point where the reaction is at equilibrium and above which the decomposition will occur spontaneously. Setting \( \Delta G \) to zero and solving for \( T \):

\[ 0 = (-61080 \text{ J}) - T(-132.22 \text{ J/K}) \]
\[ T(-132.22 \text{ J/K}) = 61080 \text{ J} \]
\[ T = \frac{61080 \text{ J}}{132.22 \text{ J/K}} \]
\[ T = 4619.7 \text{ K} \]

However, this calculation does not take into account the partial pressure of oxygen. To account for the partial pressure, we need to consider the reaction quotient \( Q \) and the equilibrium constant \( K \). The relationship between \( \Delta G \) and \( K \) is given by:

\[ \Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + RT \ln Q \]

At equilibrium, \( \Delta G = 0 \) and \( Q = K \), so:

\[ 0 = \Delta G^\circ + RT \ln K \]

We can rearrange this to solve for \( \ln K \):

\[ \ln K = -\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{RT} \]

Since we do not have the value of \( K \) at the given partial pressure of oxygen, we cannot directly calculate the temperature at which the decomposition occurs. However, we can still find the temperature at which \( \Delta G = 0 \) for the standard state (where \( \Delta G^\circ = 0 \)). This temperature is the theoretical upper limit for the decomposition temperature under standard conditions.

Using the standard state values, we already calculated \( T \) to be approximately 4619.7 K. However, since the partial pressure of oxygen is less than 1 atm, the actual decomposition temperature will be lower than this calculated value because a lower partial pressure of oxygen favors the decomposition of \( Ag_2O \).

Since we do not have an explicit relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen and the decomposition temperature, we cannot calculate the exact temperature without additional information. However, we can state that the decomposition temperature will be below 4619.7 K due to the lower partial pressure of oxygen.

For the purpose of this question, assuming that the standard state conditions are a reasonable approximation, the temperature above which \( Ag_2O \) decomposes is:

\[ \boxed{4619.7 \text{ K}} \]

Please note that this is an approximation and the actual decomposition temperature will be lower due to the partial pressure of oxygen being less than 1 atm. To find the exact temperature, we would need the dependence of the equilibrium constant \( K \) on the partial pressure of oxygen or additional experimental data.

The answer is: 4619.7 \text{ K}.",,,0,
Thermodynamics,103,G-META-18-53,NUM,74,"Given: Specific heat capacity of copper (between 250 K and 500 K) is 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ . Assume that the system containing the two pieces of copper remains isolated during this process. A 1 mol piece of copper at 400 K is brought in contact with another 1 mol piece of copper at 300 K, and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. The entropy(in J $K^(-1)$ to three decimal places) change for this process is? "," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the entropy change for both pieces of copper and then sum them up to find the total entropy change of the system. Since the system is isolated, the total entropy change must be greater than or equal to zero, according to the second law of thermodynamics.

The entropy change for a substance undergoing a temperature change at constant pressure can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \Delta S = n \int_{T_i}^{T_f} \frac{C_p}{T} \, dT \]

where:
- \( \Delta S \) is the entropy change,
- \( n \) is the number of moles,
- \( C_p \) is the heat capacity at constant pressure (which is given as 22.6 J/K/mol for copper in the given temperature range),
- \( T_i \) is the initial temperature,
- \( T_f \) is the final temperature.

Since both pieces of copper are 1 mol each and they reach thermal equilibrium, the final temperature \( T_f \) can be found using the conservation of energy principle. The heat lost by the hotter piece of copper will be equal to the heat gained by the cooler piece:

\[ n \cdot C_p \cdot (T_{f,hot} - T_f) = n \cdot C_p \cdot (T_f - T_{f,cold}) \]

Given that \( T_{f,hot} = 400 \) K and \( T_{f,cold} = 300 \) K, we can find \( T_f \):

\[ 1 \cdot 22.6 \cdot (400 - T_f) = 1 \cdot 22.6 \cdot (T_f - 300) \]
\[ 400 - T_f = T_f - 300 \]
\[ 2T_f = 700 \]
\[ T_f = 350 \text{ K} \]

Now we can calculate the entropy change for each piece of copper:

For the hotter piece (1 mol at 400 K to 350 K):
\[ \Delta S_{hot} = n \int_{400}^{350} \frac{22.6}{T} \, dT \]
\[ \Delta S_{hot} = 1 \cdot 22.6 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{350}{400}\right) \]

For the cooler piece (1 mol at 300 K to 350 K):
\[ \Delta S_{cold} = n \int_{300}^{350} \frac{22.6}{T} \, dT \]
\[ \Delta S_{cold} = 1 \cdot 22.6 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{350}{300}\right) \]

Now we calculate the numerical values:

\[ \Delta S_{hot} = 22.6 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{350}{400}\right) \approx 22.6 \cdot \ln(0.875) \approx -5.747 \text{ J/K} \]
\[ \Delta S_{cold} = 22.6 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{350}{300}\right) \approx 22.6 \cdot \ln(1.1667) \approx 5.980 \text{ J/K} \]

The total entropy change is the sum of the two:

\[ \Delta S_{total} = \Delta S_{hot} + \Delta S_{cold} \]
\[ \Delta S_{total} = -5.747 + 5.980 \]
\[ \Delta S_{total} = 0.233 \text{ J/K} \]

Therefore, the entropy change for the process is:

- \( \Delta S_{total} = 0.233 \) J/K

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

We are given:
- ΔH° = -74,900 J.mol⁻¹
- ΔS° = -80 J.mol⁻¹.K⁻¹
- T = 300 K
- R = 8.314 J.mol⁻¹.K⁻¹

First, we calculate ΔG° using the given values:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°
ΔG° = -74,900 J.mol⁻¹ - (300 K * -80 J.mol⁻¹.K⁻¹)
ΔG° = -74,900 J.mol⁻¹ + 24,900 J.mol⁻¹
ΔG° = -50,000 J.mol⁻¹

The equilibrium constant K can be found using the relationship between ΔG° and K:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

We can rearrange this equation to solve for K:

ln K = -ΔG° / (RT)

Now plug in the values:

ln K = -(-50,000 J.mol⁻¹) / (8.314 J.mol⁻¹.K⁻¹ * 300 K)
ln K = 50,000 / (2,494.2 J.mol⁻¹)
ln K ≈ 20.04

To find K, we take the antilogarithm (exponential) of both sides:

K = e^(20.04)

Using a calculator, we find:

K ≈ e^(20.04) ≈ 4.0 × 10^8

Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the reaction at 300 K is approximately 4.0 × 10^8.

The critical radius (in nm, rounded off to one decimal place) of nickel nucleus during solidification at 1673 K is "," To find the critical radius of a nickel nucleus during solidification, we can use the Gibbs-Thomson equation, which relates the melting point depression to the curvature of the solid-liquid interface. The critical radius \( r^* \) is the radius at which the solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium at a temperature \( T \) below the equilibrium melting temperature \( T_m \). The equation is given by:

- \( \gamma \) is the liquid-solid interfacial energy (0.5 \( \text{J m}^{-2} \)),
- \( T_m \) is the equilibrium melting temperature of nickel (1728 K),
- \( L_f \) is the enthalpy of fusion of nickel (2.65 \( \times 10^9 \) \( \text{J m}^{-3} \)),

- \( \rho \) is the density of nickel (not given, but we can assume it to be approximately 8900 \( \text{kg m}^{-3} \) for solid nickel).

First, we calculate the undercooling \( \Delta T \):

\[ \Delta T = T_m - T = 1728 \text{ K} - 1673 \text{ K} = 55 \text{ K} \]

Now we can plug in the values to find the critical radius:

\[ r^* = \frac{2 \times 0.5 \text{ J m}^{-2} \times 1728 \text{ K}}{2.65 \times 10^9 \text{ J m}^{-3} \times 55 \text{ K} \times 8900 \text{ kg m}^{-3}} \]

The two given reactions are:

1. \(2Cu(s) + 0.5S_2(g) \rightarrow Cu_2S(s)\), ΔG° at 973 K = -100 kJ
2. \(SO_2(g) \rightarrow 0.5S_2(g) + O_2(g)\), ΔG° at 973 K = 292 kJ

The equilibrium reaction we are interested in is the sum of these two reactions:

\(2Cu(s) + SO_2(g) \rightarrow Cu_2S(s) + O_2(g)\)

To find the ΔG° for the equilibrium reaction, we add the ΔG° values of the two component reactions:

ΔG° (equilibrium reaction) = ΔG° (reaction 1) + ΔG° (reaction 2)
ΔG° (equilibrium reaction) = (-100 kJ) + (292 kJ)
ΔG° (equilibrium reaction) = 192 kJ

Now, for the equilibrium reaction, the relationship between ΔG° and the equilibrium constant K is given by:

ΔG° = -RT ln(K)

where R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol^(-1) K^(-1)) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (973 K). K for this reaction is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of partial pressures:

\(K = \frac{P_{O_2}}{P_{SO_2}}\)

So we have:

ΔG° = -RT ln(K)
192 kJ = -(8.314 J mol^(-1) K^(-1)) * (973 K) * ln(K)

Now, we need to convert 192 kJ to joules to match the units of R:

192 kJ = 192,000 J

Next, we solve for ln(K):

192,000 J = -(8.314 J mol^(-1) K^(-1)) * (973 K) * ln(K)
-192,000 J = (8.314 J mol^(-1) K^(-1)) * (973 K) * ln(K)
ln(K) = -192,000 J / ((8.314 J mol^(-1) K^(-1)) * (973 K))

Now, we calculate the value of ln(K):

ln(K) = -192,000 / (8.314 * 973)
ln(K) ≈ -24.92

One mole of an ideal gas at 10atm and 300K undergoes reversible adiabatic expansion to a pressure of one atm. The work done(in Joules) by the gas is?(round off to nearest integer)"," To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature for an adiabatic process of an ideal gas, which is given by:

\[ PV^\gamma = \text{constant} \]

where \( P \) is the pressure, \( V \) is the volume, and \( \gamma \) is the heat capacity ratio (\( C_p/C_v \)). For an ideal gas, \( \gamma \) can also be calculated using the heat capacities:

\[ \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{C_p}{C_p - R} \]

Given that \( C_p = 2.5 R \), we can find \( C_v \):

\[ C_v = C_p - R = 2.5 R - R = 1.5 R \]

Now we can calculate \( \gamma \):

\[ \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{2.5 R}{1.5 R} = \frac{5}{3} \]

For an adiabatic process, the following relation holds between the initial and final states:

\[ P_1V_1^\gamma = P_2V_2^\gamma \]

We can solve for the ratio of volumes:

\[ \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^\gamma = \frac{P_1}{P_2} \]

\[ \frac{V_2}{V_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/\gamma} \]

Given that \( P_1 = 10 \) atm and \( P_2 = 1 \) atm, we can plug in the values:

\[ \frac{V_2}{V_1} = \left(\frac{10 \text{ atm}}{1 \text{ atm}}\right)^{1/\gamma} = 10^{1/\gamma} = 10^{3/5} \]

Now, we can calculate the work done on the gas during an adiabatic expansion. For an adiabatic process, the work done is equal to the change in internal energy, since \( Q = 0 \) (no heat is exchanged):

\[ W = \Delta U = nC_v\Delta T \]

However, we need to express the work done in terms of pressure and volume. For an adiabatic process, the work done can be calculated using:

\[ W = \frac{P_1V_1 - P_2V_2}{\gamma - 1} \]

Since \( P_1V_1^\gamma = P_2V_2^\gamma \), we can substitute \( P_2V_2^\gamma \) for \( P_1V_1^\gamma \) in the equation for work:

\[ W = \frac{P_1V_1 - P_1V_1(P_2/P_1)^{1/\gamma}}{\gamma - 1} \]

\[ W = \frac{P_1V_1(1 - (P_2/P_1)^{1/\gamma})}{\gamma - 1} \]

\[ W = \frac{P_1V_1(1 - 10^{-3/5})}{\frac{5}{3} - 1} \]

\[ W = \frac{P_1V_1(1 - 10^{-0.6})}{\frac{2}{3}} \]

\[ W = \frac{3}{2} \cdot P_1V_1 \cdot (1 - 10^{-0.6}) \]

Since we don't have the initial volume \( V_1 \), we can use the ideal gas law to express \( V_1 \) in terms of \( P_1 \), \( R \), and \( T \):

\[ P_1V_1 = nRT \]

For one mole of gas, \( n = 1 \), so:

\[ V_1 = \frac{RT}{P_1} \]

Now we can substitute \( V_1 \) back into the equation for work:

\[ W = \frac{3}{2} \cdot P_1 \cdot \frac{RT}{P_1} \cdot (1 - 10^{-0.6}) \]

\[ W = \frac{3}{2} \cdot RT \cdot (1 - 10^{-0.6}) \]

- \( \Delta P \) is the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the bubble,
- \( \gamma \) is the surface tension,
- \( r \) is the radius of the bubble.

Given:
- \( \gamma = 1.4 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \),
- \( r = 0.01 \, \text{mm} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) (since 1 mm = 0.001 m),
- The pressure outside the bubble, \( P_{\text{outside}} = 1.5 \, \text{bar} = 1.5 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \) (since 1 bar = \( 10^5 \) Pa).

First, we convert the radius to meters and then calculate the pressure difference due to surface tension:

\[ \Delta P = \frac{2 \times 1.4 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^{-1}}{1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} \]
\[ \Delta P = \frac{2.8 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^{-1}}{1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} \]
\[ \Delta P = 2.8 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa} \]

Now, we add the external pressure to find the total pressure inside the bubble:

\[ P_{\text{inside}} = P_{\text{outside}} + \Delta P \]
\[ P_{\text{inside}} = 1.5 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} + 2.8 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa} \]
\[ P_{\text{inside}} = (1.5 + 28) \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \]
\[ P_{\text{inside}} = 29.5 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \]

Finally, we convert the pressure inside the bubble from Pascals to bars:

\[ P_{\text{inside}} = \frac{29.5 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}}{10^5 \, \text{Pa/bar}} \]
\[ P_{\text{inside}} = 29.5 \, \text{bar} \]

Rounded to one decimal place, the pressure inside the bubble is:

\[ P_{\text{inside}} = 29.5 \, \text{bar} \]

So the final answer is:

- The pressure inside the bubble is 29.5 bar.

What is the equilibrium ($p_(CO)$/$p_(CO_2)$) ratio for the given reaction at 1873 K? (round off to 2 decimal places). Mo(s) + $O_2$(g) ⇔ $MoO_2$(s)," To find the equilibrium pressure ratio $p_(CO)$/$p_(CO_2)$ for the reaction

\[ CO(g) + 0.5O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons CO_2(g) \]

at 1873 K, we can use the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction, $Δ_(r)G°$, and the relationship between the Gibbs free energy change and the equilibrium constant, $K_p$.

The relationship between $Δ_(r)G°$ and $K_p$ is given by:

\[ Δ_(r)G° = -RT \ln K_p \]

where $R$ is the gas constant (8.314 J.K^(-1).mol^(-1)) and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

Given $Δ_(r)G°$(1873 K) = -120860 J, we can solve for $K_p$:

\[ -120860 J = -(8.314 J.K^(-1).mol^(-1))(1873 K) \ln K_p \]

\[ \ln K_p = \frac{-120860 J}{(8.314 J.K^(-1).mol^(-1))(1873 K)} \]

\[ \ln K_p = \frac{-120860}{15587.822} \]

\[ \ln K_p \approx -7.755 \]

\[ K_p \approx e^{-7.755} \]

\[ K_p \approx \frac{1}{e^{7.755}} \]

\[ K_p \approx 0.00045 \]

Now, the equilibrium constant $K_p$ for the reaction is given by:

\[ K_p = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO} \cdot p_{O_2}^{0.5}} \]

Since the reaction involves half a mole of $O_2$, we need to be careful with the stoichiometry. If we assume that the partial pressure of $O_2$ is maintained at a constant value (which is common in industrial processes where $O_2$ is in excess), we can simplify the expression by incorporating the constant $O_2$ pressure into a new equilibrium constant, $K'_p$:

\[ K'_p = K_p \cdot p_{O_2}^{0.5} \]

\[ K'_p = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}} \]

Given that $K_p \approx 0.00045$, and assuming $p_{O_2}$ is constant and its effect is included in $K'_p$, we have:

\[ K'_p \approx 0.00045 \]

Therefore, the equilibrium pressure ratio is:

\[ \frac{p_{CO}}{p_{CO_2}} \approx \frac{1}{K'_p} \]

\[ \frac{p_{CO}}{p_{CO_2}} \approx \frac{1}{0.00045} \]

\[ \frac{p_{CO}}{p_{CO_2}} \approx 2222.22 \]

Rounded to two decimal places, the equilibrium pressure ratio $p_{CO}$/$p_{CO_2}$ is approximately 2222.22.

Thermodynamics,110,G-META-22-53,NUM,43,"Given: R = 8.314 J.$K^(-1).mol^(-1)$. The partial molar enthalpy of Au in Ag-Au melt containing 25 mol% Au at 1400 K is -8300 $J.mol^(-1)$ . Assuming regular solution behavior, the activity of Au in the melt is? (round off to 3 decimal places). "," To solve this problem, we can use the relation between the activity of a component in a solution and its partial molar properties. For a regular solution, the activity \( a_i \) of component \( i \) can be related to its partial molar enthalpy \( \bar{H}_i \) and the mole fraction \( X_i \) by the following equation:

\[ \ln a_i = \frac{\bar{H}_i - H_i^0}{RT} \]

where:
- \( R \) is the gas constant (8.314 J.K^(-1).mol^(-1))
- \( T \) is the temperature (1400 K)
- \( \bar{H}_i \) is the partial molar enthalpy of component \( i \) in the solution
- \( H_i^0 \) is the molar enthalpy of pure component \( i \) at the same temperature and pressure
- \( a_i \) is the activity of component \( i \)
- \( X_i \) is the mole fraction of component \( i \)

Since we are assuming regular solution behavior, we can assume that the molar enthalpy of pure Au \( H_{\text{Au}}^0 \) is zero because it is a reference state. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[ \ln a_{\text{Au}} = \frac{\bar{H}_{\text{Au}}}{RT} \]

Given:
- \( \bar{H}_{\text{Au}} = -8300 \) J.mol^(-1)
- \( R = 8.314 \) J.K^(-1).mol^(-1)
- \( T = 1400 \) K

We can plug in the values:

\[ \ln a_{\text{Au}} = \frac{-8300 \text{ J.mol}^-1}{(8.314 \text{ J.K}^-1.\text{mol}^-1)(1400 \text{ K})} \]

\[ \ln a_{\text{Au}} = \frac{-8300}{11639.6} \]

\[ \ln a_{\text{Au}} \approx -0.7132 \]

Now, to find the activity \( a_{\text{Au}} \), we take the exponential of both sides:

\[ a_{\text{Au}} = e^{-0.7132} \]

\[ a_{\text{Au}} \approx 0.490 \]

Rounded to three decimal places, the activity of Au in the melt is:

During solidification of a pure metal, the radius(in nm) of critical nucleus at an undercooling of 10 K is? (answer rounded off to 1 decimal place). "," To find the radius of the critical nucleus during the solidification of a pure metal, we can use the Gibbs-Thomson equation, which relates the undercooling (ΔT) to the critical radius (r*) of the nucleus:

ΔT = (2σ_sl) / (ΔH_f * r*)

where:
- ΔT is the undercooling (T_m - T), with T_m being the melting point and T being the temperature at which the nucleus forms.
- σ_sl is the solid/liquid interface energy.
- ΔH_f is the latent heat of fusion per unit volume.
- r* is the radius of the critical nucleus.

Given:
- σ_sl = 0.177 J.m^(-2)
- T_m = 1356 K
- ΔH_f = 1.88 × 10^9 J.m^(-3)
- ΔT = T_m - T = 1356 K - (1356 K - 10 K) = 10 K

We can rearrange the Gibbs-Thomson equation to solve for r*:

r* = (2σ_sl) / (ΔH_f * ΔT)

Now, plug in the given values:

r* = (2 * 0.177 J.m^(-2)) / (1.88 × 10^9 J.m^(-3) * 10 K)

r* = (0.354 J.m^(-2)) / (1.88 × 10^10 J.m^(-3))

r* = 1.88 × 10^(-11) m^(-1)

r* = 1.88 × 10^(-11) m

To convert this to nanometers (nm), we use the conversion factor 1 m = 10^9 nm:

r* = 1.88 × 10^(-11) m * 10^9 nm/m

r* = 1.88 × 10^(-2) nm

Assuming that Dulong-Petit law is valid for a monoatomic solid, the ratio of heat capacities $C_(p)/C_(v)$ at 500K is? (round off to 3 decimals). "," To find the ratio of heat capacities $C_p/C_v$ for a monoatomic solid, we can use the Mayer relation, which is derived from the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The Mayer relation connects the heat capacities at constant pressure ($C_p$) and constant volume ($C_v$) with the molar volume ($V_m$), isothermal compressibility ($\kappa_T$), and isobaric expansivity ($\alpha$):

\[ C_p - C_v = \frac{V_m \cdot \alpha^2 \cdot T}{\kappa_T} \]

where $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

For a monoatomic solid, the Dulong-Petit law states that the molar heat capacity at constant volume ($C_v$) is approximately equal to $3R$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. Therefore, we can write:

\[ C_v \approx 3R \]

Given:
- Molar volume ($V_m$) = $7 \times 10^{-6} m^3.mol^{-1}$
- Isothermal compressibility ($\kappa_T$) = $8 \times 10^{-12} Pa^{-1}$
- Isobaric expansivity ($\alpha$) = $6 \times 10^{-5} K^{-1}$
- Ideal gas constant ($R$) = $8.314 J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1}$
- Temperature ($T$) = $500 K$

First, we calculate $C_p - C_v$:

\[ C_p - C_v = \frac{V_m \cdot \alpha^2 \cdot T}{\kappa_T} \]
\[ C_p - C_v = \frac{(7 \times 10^{-6} m^3.mol^{-1}) \cdot (6 \times 10^{-5} K^{-1})^2 \cdot (500 K)}{8 \times 10^{-12} Pa^{-1}} \]
\[ C_p - C_v = \frac{(7 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (36 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (500)}{8 \times 10^{-12}} \]
\[ C_p - C_v = \frac{(7 \times 36 \times 500) \times 10^{-6-10+12}}{8} \]
\[ C_p - C_v = \frac{(7 \times 36 \times 500)}{8} \]
\[ C_p - C_v = \frac{126000}{8} \]
\[ C_p - C_v = 15750 J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1} \]

Now, we know that $C_v \approx 3R$, so:

\[ C_v \approx 3 \times 8.314 J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1} \]
\[ C_v \approx 24.942 J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1} \]

Using the Mayer relation:

\[ C_p = C_v + (C_p - C_v) \]
\[ C_p \approx 24.942 + 15750 \]
\[ C_p \approx 15774.942 J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1} \]

Finally, we find the ratio $C_p/C_v$:

\[ \frac{C_p}{C_v} \approx \frac{15774.942}{24.942} \]
\[ \frac{C_p}{C_v} \approx 632.467 \]

Rounded to three decimal places, the ratio $C_p/C_v$ is:

\[ \boxed{632.468} \]

Assume specific heat capacity of air to be constant and equal to 1080 $J.kg^(-1).K^(-1)$ and π = 3.14. Air at 300 K is passed at a mass flow rate of 1.5 $kg.s^(-1)$ through a metallic tube of inner diameter 0.08 m. Inner wall temperature of the tube is maintained at 700 K. Temperature of the air leaving the tube is 600 K. Assuming that heat transfer occurs entirely by steady state convection, length of the tube(in metres) is? (round off to 2 decimal places). "," To solve for the length of the tube, we can use the convective heat transfer equation for the inside of a tube, which is given by:

\[ q = h A (T_w - T_b) \]

where:
- \( q \) is the rate of heat transfer (W),
- \( h \) is the coefficient of convective heat transfer (\( W.m^{-2}.K^{-1} \)),
- \( A \) is the surface area for heat transfer (\( m^2 \)),
- \( T_w \) is the inner wall temperature (K),
- \( T_b \) is the bulk temperature of the air (K).

The rate of heat transfer can also be expressed in terms of the mass flow rate and the specific heat capacity of the air:

\[ q = \dot{m} c_p (T_{out} - T_{in}) \]

where:
- \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate (\( kg.s^{-1} \)),
- \( c_p \) is the specific heat capacity of air (\( J.kg^{-1}.K^{-1} \)),
- \( T_{out} \) is the temperature of the air leaving the tube (K),
- \( T_{in} \) is the temperature of the air entering the tube (K).

By equating the two expressions for \( q \), we can solve for the length of the tube \( L \):

\[ h A (T_w - T_b) = \dot{m} c_p (T_{out} - T_{in}) \]

The surface area \( A \) for a tube of inner diameter \( D \) and length \( L \) is:

\[ A = \pi D L \]

Substituting \( A \) into the heat transfer equation and solving for \( L \):

\[ h (\pi D L) (T_w - T_b) = \dot{m} c_p (T_{out} - T_{in}) \]
\[ L = \frac{\dot{m} c_p (T_{out} - T_{in})}{h (\pi D) (T_w - T_b)} \]

Given:

- \( T_w = 700 \, K \)

(A) Simple tetragonal (B) Body centred tetragonal (C) Base centred orthorhombic (D) Face centred tetragonal," To answer the question, we need to understand what a Bravais lattice is and then determine which of the given options does not fit the criteria of a Bravais lattice.

A Bravais lattice is a 14-lattice configuration that represents the geometric arrangement of points in a crystal. These lattices are used to describe the symmetry of the crystal structures. The 14 Bravais lattices are composed of the 7 crystal systems (cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral, hexagonal, monoclinic, and triclinic) and their variations based on the placement of lattice points within the unit cell.

The options given are:

(A) Simple tetragonal
(B) Body centred tetragonal
(C) Base centred orthorhombic
(D) Face centred tetragonal

Let's go through each option:

(A) Simple tetragonal - This is a Bravais lattice. It has a single lattice point at each corner of the tetragonal prism.

(B) Body centred tetragonal - This is also a Bravais lattice. It has lattice points at each corner of the tetragonal prism and one additional point at the center of the prism.

(C) Base centred orthorhombic - This is a Bravais lattice as well. It belongs to the orthorhombic crystal system and has lattice points at each corner of the orthorhombic prism and additional points at the centers of the two bases.

(D) Face centred tetragonal - This is not a standard Bravais lattice. In the tetragonal system, the only Bravais lattices are simple tetragonal and body-centered tetragonal. A face-centered tetragonal lattice would imply that there are lattice points at the centers of each of the six faces of the tetragonal prism, in addition to the corners. However, this arrangement does not represent a unique symmetry and can be described by the body-centered tetragonal lattice.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1.442 Å (B) 2.880 Å (C) 4.323 Å (D) 5.764 Å   ," To calculate the lattice parameter of chromium with a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, we can use the relationship between the atomic diameter and the lattice parameter. In a bcc structure, the atomic diameter is equal to the length of the space diagonal of the cube.

The space diagonal of a cube can be related to the lattice parameter (a) by the formula:

\[ \text{Space diagonal} = a \sqrt{3} \]

Given that the atomic diameter is 2.494 Å, we can set this equal to the space diagonal:

\[ 2.494 \text{ Å} = a \sqrt{3} \]

Now we solve for the lattice parameter (a):

\[ a = \frac{2.494 \text{ Å}}{\sqrt{3}} \]

\[ a = \frac{2.494 \text{ Å}}{1.732} \]

\[ a \approx \frac{2.494 \text{ Å}}{1.732} \]

\[ a \approx 1.440 \text{ Å} \]

Since the question asks for the lattice parameter assuming tight atomic bonding, which implies that the atoms are touching along the body diagonal, this calculation is correct.

Therefore, the lattice parameter of chromium is approximately 1.440 Å.

The correct answer is:

Atomic structure,3,G-XEC-2012-22,MCQS-NUM,36,Chromium has the bcc structure with atomic diameter of 2.494 Å. Find the first diffraction peak position (2θ) for Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 1.54 Å  (A) 21.76° (B) 33.05° (C) 44.43° (D) 66.10°     ," To find the first diffraction peak position (2θ) for a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure using Cu Kα radiation, we can use the Bragg's law formula:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where:
- n is the order of the reflection (for the first peak, n = 1),
- λ is the wavelength of the incident radiation (1.54 Å for Cu Kα),
- d is the spacing between the planes in the crystal lattice,
- θ is the angle of incidence.

For a bcc structure, the first peak typically corresponds to the (110) plane. The spacing between these planes (d) can be calculated using the atomic diameter and the geometry of the bcc lattice.

In a bcc lattice, the atomic diameter (D) is related to the lattice parameter (a) by the formula:

D = a√3

The spacing for the (110) planes in a bcc lattice is given by:

d = a/√(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

For the (110) planes, h, k, and l are 1, 1, and 0, respectively, so:

d = a/√(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2)
d = a/√2

Now, we can solve for the lattice parameter (a) using the given atomic diameter (D):

a = D / √3
a = 2.494 Å / √3
a ≈ 1.44 Å

Now we can find d:

d = a / √2
d ≈ 1.44 Å / √2
d ≈ 1.02 Å

Using Bragg's law for the first-order reflection (n = 1):

λ = 2d sin(θ)
1.54 Å = 2 * 1.02 Å * sin(θ)
sin(θ) = 1.54 Å / (2 * 1.02 Å)
sin(θ) ≈ 0.7549

Now we find the angle θ:

θ ≈ sin^(-1)(0.7549)

Using a calculator, we find:

θ ≈ 49.03°

Since the question asks for 2θ, we simply double this value:

2θ ≈ 2 * 49.03°
2θ ≈ 98.06°

However, this value is not among the options provided, which suggests there might be an error in the calculation or interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation for the (110) planes in a bcc lattice should be:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)
d = a / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2)
d = a / √2

Given that a = D / √3, we have:

a = 2.494 Å / √3
a ≈ 1.44 Å

Now we find d correctly:

d = a / √2
d ≈ 1.44 Å / √2
d ≈ 1.02 Å

Now, using Bragg's law:

λ = 2d sin(θ)
1.54 Å = 2 * 1.02 Å * sin(θ)
sin(θ) = 1.54 Å / (2 * 1.02 Å)
sin(θ) ≈ 0.7549

θ ≈ sin^(-1)(0.7549)
θ ≈ 49.03°

2θ ≈ 2 * 49.03°
2θ ≈ 98.06°

This value is still not among the options provided. It seems there was a mistake in the interpretation of the crystal plane for the bcc structure. The first diffraction peak for a bcc structure is actually from the (110) plane, and the calculation above is correct for that plane.

However, if we consider the possibility of the question referring to a different plane, such as the (200) plane, which is also a common peak for bcc structures, we would have:",,,0,

(B) Dislocations can move inside a crystal under the action of an applied stress. (C) Screw dislocations can change the slip plane without climb (D) Burger’s vector of an edge dislocation is parallel to the dislocation line.," To answer the question, let's analyze each option:

(A) Dislocations are thermodynamically unstable defects.
- This statement is generally true. Dislocations are line defects that can increase the internal energy of a crystal, making them thermodynamically unstable. However, they can be kinetically stable due to the high energy barrier required for their elimination.

(B) Dislocations can move inside a crystal under the action of an applied stress.
- This statement is correct. Dislocations can glide through a crystal lattice under the influence of shear stress, which is a primary mechanism of plastic deformation in materials.

(C) Screw dislocations can change the slip plane without climb.
- This statement is incorrect. Screw dislocations can glide on the slip plane but cannot change the slip plane without the process of climb, which involves the movement of atoms to or from the dislocation line. Climb is necessary for a dislocation to move out of its slip plane.

(D) Burger’s vector of an edge dislocation is parallel to the dislocation line.
- This statement is incorrect. For an edge dislocation, the Burger's vector is perpendicular to the dislocation line. In contrast, for a screw dislocation, the Burger's vector is parallel to the dislocation line.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

- C and D are incorrect, but since the question asks for the one that is NOT correct, we should choose the statement that is entirely correct.
- B is a correct statement, so it cannot be the answer to the question.
- A is generally true but can be context-dependent, as dislocations can be stable under certain conditions.
- The statement that is NOT correct is C, as screw dislocations cannot change the slip plane without climb.

Atomic structure,7,G-XEC-2014-8,MCQS,29,The equilibrium concentration of vacancies in a pure metal   (A) increases exponentially with temperature (B) decreases exponentially with temperature (C) varies linearly with temperature (D) is independent of temperature," The correct answer to the question regarding the equilibrium concentration of vacancies in a pure metal is:

(A) increases exponentially with temperature

The formation of vacancies in a metal is an endothermic process, meaning it requires energy. As the temperature increases, the thermal energy available to the atoms in the metal lattice also increases. This increased energy allows more atoms to overcome the energy barrier required to leave their lattice sites and create vacancies. The relationship between the concentration of vacancies, [V], and the temperature, T, can be described by the equation:

\[ [V] = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_f}{kT}\right) \]

where:
- \( A \) is a constant related to the number of available sites and the attempt frequency for atom jumps,
- \( E_f \) is the energy required to form a vacancy (the formation energy),
- \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature.

Since the vacancy concentration depends on an exponential function of the negative reciprocal of temperature, it increases exponentially as the temperature increases.

Atomic structure,8,G-XEC-2014-21,NUM,35,The expected diffraction angle (in degrees) for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for face centered cubic Pt (lattice parameter = 0.392 nm) using monochromatic radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm is," To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg's law of X-ray diffraction, which relates the wavelength of the radiation to the spacing between the planes in the crystal and the angle at which the radiation is diffracted. Bragg's law is given by:

\[ n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

where:
- \( n \) is the order of the reflection (in this case, \( n = 1 \) for the first order),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the incident radiation,
- \( d \) is the spacing between the planes in the crystal, and
- \( \theta \) is the angle of incidence/diffraction.

For a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, the interplanar spacing \( d \) for a plane denoted by Miller indices (\( hkl \)) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)}{a^2} \]

where \( a \) is the lattice parameter.

Given:
- Lattice parameter \( a = 0.392 \) nm for Pt,
- Miller indices \( hkl = 113 \),
- Wavelength \( \lambda = 0.1542 \) nm,
- Order of reflection \( n = 1 \).

First, we calculate \( d \) for the (113) planes:

\[ d_{113} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} = \frac{0.392 \text{ nm}}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2}} = \frac{0.392 \text{ nm}}{\sqrt{1 + 1 + 9}} = \frac{0.392 \text{ nm}}{\sqrt{11}} \]

\[ d_{113} = \frac{0.392 \text{ nm}}{3.317} \approx 0.1182 \text{ nm} \]

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the diffraction angle \( \theta \):

\[ \lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

\[ \sin(\theta) = \frac{\lambda}{2d} \]

\[ \sin(\theta) = \frac{0.1542 \text{ nm}}{2 \times 0.1182 \text{ nm}} \]

\[ \sin(\theta) = \frac{0.1542}{0.2364} \]

\[ \sin(\theta) \approx 0.6524 \]

To find the angle \( \theta \), we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of \( \sin(\theta) \):

\[ \theta = \arcsin(0.6524) \]

Using a calculator, we find:

\[ \theta \approx 40.96^\circ \]

Therefore, the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for face-centered cubic Pt is approximately \( 40.96^\circ \).

The correct answer is:

(A) Deformation twinning: Vacancies can influence the nucleation and growth of twins during deformation, as they can act as nucleation sites for twins and affect the mobility of twin boundaries.

(B) Self diffusion: Vacancies are the primary mechanism by which atoms diffuse through a solid during self diffusion. An atom can jump into a neighboring vacant site, effectively moving through the crystal lattice.

(C) Strain hardening: The movement of dislocations, which is responsible for plastic deformation, can be hindered by vacancies. As vacancies can act as pinning points for dislocations, they can contribute to strain hardening by making dislocation motion more difficult.

(D) Cross-slip: Vacancies can affect the ease with which dislocations can cross-slip from one slip plane to another. The presence of vacancies can either assist or impede cross-slip, depending on the specific circumstances and the configuration of the dislocations and vacancies.

Given the importance of vacancies in each of these processes, the question seems to be asking which process is most directly influenced by the presence of vacancies. While vacancies play a role in all the listed phenomena, their most direct and fundamental role is in self diffusion, where the presence of vacancies is an absolute requirement for the diffusion of atoms.

(A) 0.25 $R^2$ (B) 0.25/$R^2$ (C) 1/$R^2$ (D) 4/$R^2$," To calculate the planar density of the (100) plane in an fcc (face-centered cubic) crystal, we need to determine the number of atoms per unit area in this plane.

In an fcc crystal, the (100) plane is a square lattice where each lattice point represents an atom. The distance between adjacent atoms in this plane is equal to the atomic diameter, which is 2R (since R is the atomic radius). Therefore, the distance between the centers of atoms along the x or y axis is 2R.

The area A of the unit cell in the (100) plane is given by the square of the distance between adjacent atoms, so:

A = (2R)^2 = 4R^2

Now, since there is one atom per unit cell in the (100) plane of an fcc crystal (the other atoms are either above or below this plane), the number of atoms per unit area is simply:

Number of atoms per unit area = 1 / A = 1 / (4R^2)

However, this is not the planar density we are looking for. The planar density is usually defined as the number of atoms per unit area in the plane, which is the inverse of the area per atom. Since there is one atom per unit cell, the area per atom is the same as the area of the unit cell.

Therefore, the planar density σ of the (100) plane is:

σ = 1 / A = 1 / (4R^2)

This means that the correct answer is not directly listed among the options provided. The options seem to be simplified or incorrect expressions of the planar density. However, if we look at the options, we can see that the closest one to our calculated planar density is (D) 4/$R^2$, but it is not exactly the same. The correct expression is 1/(4R^2), which is the reciprocal of option (D).

Since none of the options match exactly, and if we must choose the closest one, we would choose option (D) 4/$R^2$, but with the understanding that it is incorrect as given and should be the reciprocal of that value.

For clarity, the correct planar density is 1/(4R^2), which is not listed among the options. If forced to select from the given options, one might choose (D) with the caveat that it is incorrect as stated.

Atomic structure,11,G-XEC-2015-64-21,NUM,30,Calculate the density of copper in kg $m^(-3)$ given that copper has an fcc lattice with a lattice parameter of 0.365 nm. Copper has an atomic weight of 63.54 amu," To calculate the density of copper given its face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice structure, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the unit cell:**
   The volume of an fcc unit cell is given by \( V = a^3 \), where \( a \) is the lattice parameter.

   Given that \( a = 0.365 \) nm, we first convert this to meters to be consistent with SI units:
   \( a = 0.365 \times 10^{-9} \) m.

   Now, calculate the volume:
   \( V = (0.365 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3 \).

2. **Calculate the mass of the unit cell:**
   In an fcc lattice, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. The mass of a single atom of copper can be found using its atomic weight, which is given in atomic mass units (amu). To convert from amu to kilograms, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \text{ amu} = 1.66053906660(50) \times 10^{-27} \) kg.

   The atomic weight of copper is \( 63.54 \) amu, so the mass of one atom of copper in kilograms is:
   \( m = 63.54 \times 1.66053906660(50) \times 10^{-27} \) kg.

   The mass of the unit cell is then:
   \( M = 4 \times m \).

3. **Calculate the density:**
   Density (\( \rho \)) is defined as mass per unit volume, so:
   \( \rho = \frac{M}{V} \).

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Volume of the unit cell:
   \( V = (0.365 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3 = 4.8989 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m}^3 \).

2. Mass of one atom of copper:
   \( m = 63.54 \times 1.66053906660(50) \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg} \).

3. Mass of the unit cell:
   \( M = 4 \times 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg} = 4.22 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg} \).

4. Density of copper:
   \( \rho = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg}}{4.8989 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m}^3} \approx 8.617 \times 10^3 \text{ kg m}^{-3} \).

Therefore, the density of copper is approximately \( 8.617 \times 10^3 \) kg \( m^{-3} \).

Here is the final answer in a list as requested:

- \( 8.617 \times 10^3 \) kg \( m^{-3} \)",,,0,

(A) 1-fold (B) 3-fold (C) 5-fold (D) 6-fold," In a perfectly periodic 3-dimensional lattice, certain rotational symmetries are forbidden due to the constraints of crystallography. The rotational symmetries that are allowed in a 3D lattice are those that can fill space without leaving gaps or causing overlaps. These symmetries correspond to certain point groups that are consistent with translational symmetry in three dimensions.

The allowed rotational axes in a 3D lattice are:

- 2-fold (C2), which corresponds to a 180-degree rotation.
- 3-fold (C3), which corresponds to a 120-degree rotation.
- 4-fold (C4), which corresponds to a 90-degree rotation.
- 6-fold (C6), which corresponds to a 60-degree rotation.

The 5-fold (C5) rotational symmetry is forbidden in a perfectly periodic 3-dimensional lattice because it cannot fill space without creating gaps or overlaps. This is a consequence of the fact that you cannot tessellate a plane with regular pentagons, which would be required for a 5-fold symmetric lattice.

- (C) 5-fold",,,0,
Atomic structure,13,G-XEC-2016-11,NUM,38,"In a diffraction experiment, monochromatic X-rays of wavelength 1.54 Å are used to examine a material with a BCC structure. If the lattice parameter is 4.1 Å, the angular position θ of the first diffraction peak(in degrees) is"," To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg's law of diffraction, which relates the wavelength of the incident radiation to the lattice spacing and the angle at which the radiation is diffracted. Bragg's law is given by:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where:
- n is the order of the diffraction peak (an integer),
- λ is the wavelength of the incident radiation,
- d is the spacing between the planes in the atomic lattice, and
- θ is the angle of incidence (and also the angle of reflection).

For a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, the first diffraction peak (n=1) corresponds to the (110) planes. The spacing d of the (110) planes in a BCC lattice can be calculated using the lattice parameter a and the Miller indices (hkl) of the plane:

For BCC, the spacing d for the (110) planes is given by:

d = a / (√(h^2 + k^2 + l^2))

For the (110) planes, h=1, k=1, and l=0, so:

d = a / (√(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2))
d = a / (√(2))

Given that the lattice parameter a is 4.1 Å, we can calculate d:

d = 4.1 Å / (√(2))
d ≈ 4.1 Å / 1.414
d ≈ 2.897 Å

Now we can use Bragg's law to find the angle θ for the first diffraction peak:

λ = 2d sin(θ)
1.54 Å = 2 * 2.897 Å * sin(θ)
sin(θ) = 1.54 Å / (2 * 2.897 Å)
sin(θ) ≈ 0.268

Now we calculate the angle θ:

θ = sin^(-1)(0.268)

Using a calculator, we find:

θ ≈ sin^(-1)(0.268) ≈ 15.54 degrees

Therefore, the angular position θ of the first diffraction peak is approximately 15.54 degrees.

Here is the correct answer in a list, as requested:

Atomic structure,14,G-XEC-2016-22,NUM,14,The angle (in degrees) between [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is," To find the angle between the [110] and [111] directions in a cubic system, we can use the dot product of the two vectors that represent these directions. In a cubic system, the vectors are simply the coordinates of the direction in the crystal lattice.

Let's denote the vectors as follows:
- Vector A for the [110] direction: A = (1, 1, 0)
- Vector B for the [111] direction: B = (1, 1, 1)

The dot product of A and B is given by:
A · B = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (0)(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

The magnitude of vector A is:
|A| = √(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = √(1 + 1) = √2

The magnitude of vector B is:
|B| = √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = √(1 + 1 + 1) = √3

The cosine of the angle θ between the two directions is given by the dot product formula:
cos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| * |B|) = 2 / (√2 * √3) = √(2/3)

Now, we can find the angle θ by taking the arccosine (inverse cosine) of cos(θ):
θ = arccos(√(2/3))

To convert this to degrees, we use the fact that 1 radian is approximately 57.2958 degrees:
θ(degrees) ≈ arccos(√(2/3)) * (180/π)

Using a calculator, we find:
θ(degrees) ≈ arccos(√(2/3)) * (180/π) ≈ 35.264 degrees

So the angle between the [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is approximately 35.264 degrees.

A Frenkel defect occurs when a cation or anion leaves its regular lattice site and moves to an interstitial site within the crystal lattice, creating both a vacancy and an interstitial defect.

Given the options:

(A) One Cl vacancy and one Na vacancy in NaCl - This is not a Frenkel defect because it describes two vacancies, one for chlorine and one for sodium, with no mention of an interstitial defect.

In the later stages of deformation:

- The amorphous regions, which are less ordered and more mobile, tend to elongate in the direction of the applied stress. This is because the chains in the amorphous regions are not as tightly packed and can more easily slide past one another.

- The crystalline regions, on the other hand, are highly ordered and the chains are tightly packed. These regions are more resistant to deformation. However, when the stress is sufficient, these regions can also deform.

(i) Polymers that are less coiled are more crystalline than those that are more coiled.
- This statement is generally true. A less coiled or more extended polymer chain can pack more regularly, leading to higher crystallinity. When polymer chains are highly coiled, it is more difficult for them to organize into a crystalline structure.

(ii) Branched polymers are more crystalline than the linear ones.
- This statement is false. Branched polymers are typically less crystalline than linear polymers because the branches disrupt the regular packing of the chains, hindering crystallization.

(iii) Polymers with inter-chain interactions have higher glass transition temperature (Tg) than those without inter-chain interactions.
- This statement is true. Inter-chain interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions, increase the stiffness of the polymer chains and require more energy to initiate segmental motion, which results in a higher Tg.

(iv) Polymers with inter-chain interactions are more crystalline than those without inter-chain interactions.
- This statement is false. While inter-chain interactions can stabilize crystal structures, they do not necessarily promote crystallinity. In fact, strong inter-chain interactions can hinder the mobility of polymer chains, making it more difficult for them to organize into a crystalline structure during solidification.

Based on the analysis:
- Statement (i) is true.

X-ray diffraction is a technique used to determine the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal. When an X-ray beam is directed at a polycrystalline sample, the atoms in the sample cause the X-rays to scatter. Constructive interference occurs when the path difference between the scattered waves is an integer multiple of the wavelength, leading to a diffraction peak. The angles at which these peaks occur depend on the spacing between the planes of atoms in the crystal lattice, which can be described by Miller indices.

Miller indices are a set of three integers (hkl) that denote the orientation of crystallographic planes in a crystal lattice. The first few Bragg peaks in an XRD pattern correspond to the planes with the largest interplanar spacings, which typically have the lowest Miller indices.

For a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, which iron has at room temperature, the first few Bragg peaks usually correspond to the following planes:

1. (110) - This plane has the largest interplanar spacing in a BCC lattice and thus typically corresponds to the first peak.
2. (200) - This is the next set of planes with a smaller interplanar spacing.
3. (211) - This set of planes has an even smaller interplanar spacing and often corresponds to the third peak.

Given this information, we can now determine the correct answer:

- (D) (110), (200), (220) - Incorrect, as (220) is not typically the third peak for a BCC structure; (211) is more common.

The maximum coordination number of the cation in the structure will be  (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 8," To determine the maximum coordination number of the cation in an ionic solid, we can use the radius ratio rule, which is a simple way to predict the coordination number of an ion in a crystal lattice based on the ratio of the radii of the cation and anion.

The radius ratio is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Radius Ratio} = \frac{\text{Radius of Cation}}{\text{Radius of Anion}} \]

Given the ionic radii of the cation and anion as 0.8 Å and 1.6 Å respectively, the radius ratio is:
\[ \text{Radius Ratio} = \frac{0.8 \text{ Å}}{1.6 \text{ Å}} = 0.5 \]

Now, we can use the radius ratio to determine the coordination number according to the following general guidelines:
- For a radius ratio of 0.155 to 0.225, the coordination number is 3.
- For a radius ratio of 0.225 to 0.414, the coordination number is 4.
- For a radius ratio of 0.414 to 0.732, the coordination number is 6.
- For a radius ratio greater than 0.732, the coordination number is 8.

Since our radius ratio is 0.5, which falls within the range of 0.414 to 0.732, the maximum coordination number of the cation in the structure will be 6.

(B) Direction of motion of dislocation is parallel to the Burgers vector. (C) Atomic displacement due to the movement of the dislocation is in the direction of the motion of the dislocation line. (D) It has a unique slip plane.," To answer the question regarding the characteristic of a screw dislocation, let's consider each option:

(A) Dislocation line and Burgers vector are parallel.
This statement is not characteristic of a screw dislocation. In a screw dislocation, the dislocation line is perpendicular to the Burgers vector.

(B) Direction of motion of dislocation is parallel to the Burgers vector.
This statement is true for a screw dislocation. The motion of a screw dislocation is in the direction of its Burgers vector, which is why it can cross-slip from one plane to another.

(C) Atomic displacement due to the movement of the dislocation is in the direction of the motion of the dislocation line.
This statement is true for a screw dislocation. The atomic displacement during the movement of a screw dislocation is indeed in the direction of the dislocation line, which is also the direction of the Burgers vector.

(D) It has a unique slip plane.
This statement is not true for a screw dislocation. Screw dislocations do not have a unique slip plane; they can glide on any plane that contains the dislocation line because the shear stress required to move the dislocation is the same on all such planes.

Based on the analysis above, the correct characteristics of a screw dislocation are:

- The direction of motion of the dislocation is parallel to the Burgers vector.
- Atomic displacement due to the movement of the dislocation is in the direction of the motion of the dislocation line.

Atomic structure,22,G-XEC-2018-6,MCQS-NUM,21,The number of vibrational degrees of freedom for a non-linear triatomic molecule are  (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3," To determine the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for a non-linear triatomic molecule, we can use the following considerations:

1. A molecule with N atoms has 3N degrees of freedom in total because each atom can move in three dimensions (x, y, and z).
2. Out of these 3N degrees of freedom, 3 are translational degrees of freedom, corresponding to the movement of the molecule's center of mass in the three spatial dimensions.
3. For non-linear molecules, there are 3 rotational degrees of freedom (rotation around the x, y, and z axes). For linear molecules, there are only 2 rotational degrees of freedom because rotation around the molecular axis does not change the orientation of the molecule in space.
4. The remaining degrees of freedom are vibrational. To find the number of vibrational degrees of freedom, we subtract the translational and rotational degrees of freedom from the total degrees of freedom.

For a triatomic molecule (N = 3), we have:
- Total degrees of freedom = 3N = 3 * 3 = 9
- Translational degrees of freedom = 3
- Rotational degrees of freedom for a non-linear molecule = 3

Therefore, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom is:
Vibrational degrees of freedom = Total degrees of freedom - Translational degrees of freedom - Rotational degrees of freedom
Vibrational degrees of freedom = 9 - 3 - 3 = 3

So, the correct answer for the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for a non-linear triatomic molecule is (D) 3.

When a $Ca^{2+}$ ion substitutes for a $Na^+$ ion, it introduces an extra positive charge into the lattice. To compensate for this, one of the following must occur:

(A) the formation of a $Na^+$ vacancy - This would remove a positive charge, which would not help in maintaining electrical neutrality since it would decrease the positive charge in the lattice, exacerbating the charge imbalance created by the $Ca^{2+}$ substitution.

(B) the creation of a $Cl^-$ interstitial - Adding an extra $Cl^-$ ion would introduce more negative charge, which could balance the extra positive charge from the $Ca^{2+}$ ion. However, this would create significant distortion in the crystal lattice due to the addition of an extra ion where there isn't space for it.

(C) the formation of a $Cl^-$ vacancy - Removing a $Cl^-$ ion would remove negative charge, which would help to balance the extra positive charge from the $Ca^{2+}$ ion. This is a more likely scenario than creating an interstitial because it does not significantly distort the lattice.

(D) the formation of a $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ vacancy pair - This would remove one positive and one negative charge, effectively canceling out the extra positive charge from the $Ca^{2+}$ ion without creating a net charge imbalance. This is a common defect pair in ionic crystals known as a Schottky defect.

Given these considerations, the most probable outcome to maintain electrical neutrality would be:

- (C) the formation of a $Cl^-$ vacancy
- (D) the formation of a $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ vacancy pair

Both of these would help to maintain charge balance in the crystal. However, option (D) is typically more favorable because it does not introduce a net charge imbalance and is a common mechanism for maintaining charge neutrality in ionic solids.

Since we know the number-averaged molecular weight of the copolymer and the degree of polymerization, we can calculate the average molecular weight of one repeat unit.

Given:
- Number-averaged molecular weight of the copolymer (Mn) = 10^5 g/mol
- Degree of polymerization (n) = 2210

The average molecular weight of one repeat unit (M_unit) can be calculated by dividing the number-averaged molecular weight of the copolymer by the degree of polymerization:

\[ M_{\text{unit}} = \frac{Mn}{n} \]

\[ M_{\text{unit}} = \frac{10^5 \text{ g/mol}}{2210} \]

\[ M_{\text{unit}} \approx 45.25 \text{ g/mol} \]

Now, we know the molecular weight of ethylene (C2H4):
- Molecular weight of ethylene = 2(12) + 4(1) = 24 + 4 = 28 g/mol

Let's denote the molecular weight of the other repeat unit as M_unknown. Since this is an alternating copolymer, each chain will have an equal number of ethylene and the unknown units. Therefore, the total molecular weight of the copolymer is made up of n/2 ethylene units and n/2 unknown units.

The sum of the molecular weights of ethylene and the unknown unit should equal twice the average molecular weight of one repeat unit:

\[ M_{\text{ethylene}} + M_{\text{unknown}} = 2M_{\text{unit}} \]

\[ 28 \text{ g/mol} + M_{\text{unknown}} = 2(45.25 \text{ g/mol}) \]

\[ M_{\text{unknown}} = 90.5 \text{ g/mol} - 28 \text{ g/mol} \]

\[ M_{\text{unknown}} = 62.5 \text{ g/mol} \]

Now we need to find which of the given options (A) through (D) has a molecular weight closest to 62.5 g/mol.

(A) $−CH_2−CH(CH_3)−$ (propylene):
- Molecular weight = 2(12) + 5(1) + 1(13) = 24 + 5 + 13 = 42 g/mol (too low)

(B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$:
- Molecular weight = 2(12) + 3(1) + 1(35.5) = 24 + 3 + 35.5 = 62.5 g/mol (matches exactly)

(C) $−CF_2−CF_2−$ (tetrafluoroethylene):
- Molecular weight = 2(12) + 4(19) = 24 + 76 = 100 g/mol (too high)

(D) $−CH_2−CH(C_6H_5)−$ (styrene):
- Molecular weight = 2(12) + 3(1) + 1(77) = 24 + 3 + 77 = 104 g/mol (too high)

The only option that matches the calculated molecular weight of the unknown repeat unit is option (B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$, with a molecular weight of 62.5 g/mol.

The lattice parameter is denoted by 'a'.

In a BCC crystal, each unit cell contains two atoms: one at each corner of the cube and one in the center of the body. However, for the purpose of calculating the number of atoms per unit area, we only need to consider the atoms that are part of the (110) plane.

The (110) plane intersects the corners of the unit cell, and each corner atom is shared by eight unit cells. Therefore, each corner atom contributes 1/8 of an atom to the unit cell. Since there are eight corners to the cube, this sums up to 8 * 1/8 = 1 atom per unit cell that lies on the (110) plane.

The area of the (110) plane can be found by considering the vectors that define the plane. In a cubic system, the vectors are orthogonal and have a length equal to the lattice parameter 'a'. The area of the parallelogram formed by two vectors in the plane is given by the cross product of those vectors.

For the (110) plane, we can take the vectors as follows:
- The vector from the origin to the point (a,0,0)
- The vector from the origin to the point (0,a,0)

The cross product of these two vectors gives the area of the (110) plane:
|A| = |a i × a j| = |a^2 k| = a^2

Since the vectors are in the plane and orthogonal, the area of the unit cell projected onto the (110) plane is simply 'a^2'.

Now, we have one atom per unit cell and an area of 'a^2' for the unit cell in the (110) plane. Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area is:

- ZnS is an ionic compound with zinc (Zn) having a +2 charge and sulfur (S) having a -2 charge. Therefore, it will exhibit ionic bonding, where the metal cation is attracted to the non-metal anion.

(Round off to two decimal places)"," To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg's law for X-ray diffraction, which is given by:

\[ n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

- \( n \) is the order of reflection (in this case, \( n = 1 \) for first-order reflection),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the X-ray beam,
- \( d \) is the spacing between the planes in the crystal,
- \( \theta \) is the angle of incidence (and reflection) with respect to the crystal planes.

For a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal, the spacing \( d \) for the {hkl} planes can be calculated using the lattice parameter \( a \) and the Miller indices \( h \), \( k \), and \( l \) as follows:

\[ \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}{a^2} \]

The third peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern of an fcc crystal typically corresponds to the {222} planes, so we have \( h = k = l = 2 \).

Given:
- \( 2\theta = 45^\circ \), so \( \theta = 22.5^\circ \),
- \( \lambda = 1.54 \) Å,
- \( n = 1 \).

First, we find \( \sin(\theta) \):

\[ \sin(\theta) = \sin(22.5^\circ) \]

Now, we use Bragg's law to find \( d \):

\[ \lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]
\[ d = \frac{\lambda}{2\sin(\theta)} \]
\[ d = \frac{1.54 \text{ Å}}{2\sin(22.5^\circ)} \]

\[ d = \frac{1.54 \text{ Å}}{0.7654} \]
\[ d \approx 2.01 \text{ Å} \]

Now, we use the relationship between \( d \) and the lattice parameter \( a \) for the {222} planes:

\[ \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}{a^2} \]
\[ \frac{1}{(2.01 \text{ Å})^2} = \frac{2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2}{a^2} \]

\[ a^2 = 48.4812 \text{ Å}^2 \]
\[ a = \sqrt{48.4812 \text{ Å}^2} \]

where \( h, k, l \) are the Miller indices of the plane. For the {200} planes, \( h = 2 \), \( k = 0 \), and \( l = 0 \), so:

\[ d_{200} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}} = \frac{a}{2} \]

To find \( x \), we need to calculate \( \exp\left(-34.86\right) \) and then compare it to \( 10^{-16} \).

\[ \exp\left(-34.86\right) \approx 1.39 \times 10^{-15} \]

Now, we can express this as \( x \times 10^{-16} \):

\[ 1.39 \times 10^{-15} = x \times 10^{-16} \]

\[ x = 1.39 \times 10^{-15} / 10^{-16} \]

\[ x = 13.9 \]

So the fraction of vacancies in pure copper at 27 °C is approximately \( 13.9 \times 10^{-16} \).

The final answer is:

- \( x = 13.9 \)",,,0,

The possible reason(s) for the colour is/are: (i) The electronic energy levels of the host materials changes significantly by doping (ii) The doped element selectively absorbs certain wavelength of light other than the perceived colour (iii) The doped element emits radiation of specific wavelength. Which of the previous statement(s) is/are true?  (A) Only (i) (B) Both (i) and (ii) (C) Both (i) and (iii) (D) Both (ii) and (iii)," The correct answer to the question is:

(B) Both (i) and (ii)

Explanation:

(i) The electronic energy levels of the host materials changes significantly by doping: This statement is true. When transition metal ions are introduced into a host material, they can introduce new electronic energy levels within the bandgap of the material. These new energy levels can lead to the absorption of photons with specific energies (wavelengths), which corresponds to transitions between these energy levels. This changes the electronic structure and can result in the material appearing colored.

(ii) The doped element selectively absorbs certain wavelengths of light other than the perceived colour: This statement is also true. Transition metal ions are known for their d-d transitions, which can selectively absorb visible light. The color we perceive from an object is the complement of the color(s) that are absorbed. For example, if a material absorbs in the blue region (~450 nm), it will appear orange to the human eye because it transmits or reflects the longer wavelengths that correspond to orange.

(iii) The doped element emits radiation of specific wavelength: This statement is generally not the reason why doped materials appear colored. While some materials can emit light upon absorption of photons (photoluminescence), the color we see from a doped inorganic material under solar light is typically due to selective absorption rather than emission. Emission processes are more relevant in the context of materials used for lighting or displays, such as phosphors or LEDs.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Both (i) and (ii).

Atomic structure,37,G-XEC-2018-20,NUM,35,X -ray diffraction pattern is obtained from FCC polycrystalline aluminium (lattice parameter = 0.405 nm) using Cr-Kα radiation of wavelength 0.229 nm. The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the pattern is ," To determine the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern of FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) polycrystalline aluminium, we need to consider the Bragg's law and the symmetry of the FCC lattice.

Bragg's law relates the wavelength of the incident X-ray (λ), the lattice spacing (d), and the angle of diffraction (θ) for constructive interference to occur:

\[ n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

where n is an integer representing the order of the reflection.

For an FCC lattice, the prominent planes that contribute to the diffraction pattern are the {111}, {200}, {220}, {311}, {222}, etc. planes. The lattice spacing d for each plane can be calculated using the lattice parameter a (0.405 nm for aluminium) and the Miller indices (hkl) of the plane:

For cubic systems, the general formula for lattice spacing is:

\[ \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)}{a^2} \]

Let's calculate the d-spacings for the first few planes:

- For the {111} plane:
  \[ d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{0.405}{\sqrt{3}} \]
- For the {200} plane:
  \[ d_{200} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}} = \frac{0.405}{\sqrt{4}} \]
- For the {220} plane:
  \[ d_{220} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2}} = \frac{0.405}{\sqrt{8}} \]
- For the {311} plane:
  \[ d_{311} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{0.405}{\sqrt{11}} \]
- For the {222} plane:
  \[ d_{222} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2}} = \frac{0.405}{\sqrt{12}} \]

We can continue this process to find other planes, but in practice, the intensity of the peaks decreases with higher order reflections, and thus the number of observable peaks is limited.

The maximum number of peaks is determined by the maximum value of n (the order of reflection) that still satisfies Bragg's law for the given wavelength and the smallest d-spacing. The smallest d-spacing corresponds to the highest Miller index plane that can be observed.

For an FCC lattice, the highest Miller index plane that typically contributes to the diffraction pattern is the {444} plane, as higher planes will have very low intensities and may not be observable.

- For the {444} plane:
  \[ d_{444} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2}} = \frac{0.405}{\sqrt{48}} \]

Now, we need to find the maximum value of n for the {444} plane using Bragg's law:

\[ n\lambda = 2d_{444}\sin(\theta) \]

The maximum value of sin(θ) is 1 (for θ = 90°), so:

\[ n_{max}\lambda = 2d_{444} \]

\[ n_{max} = \frac{2d_{444}}{\lambda} \]

\[ n_{max} = \frac{2 \times \frac{0.405}{\sqrt{48}}}{0.229} \]

Calculating this gives us the maximum order of reflection that can be observed. However, since we are looking for the maximum number of peaks and not the maximum order of reflection, we need to consider that each plane can give rise to multiple orders of reflection (as long as the order does not exceed n_max).

In practice, the number of observable peaks will be less than the theoretical maximum because the intensity of higher-order reflections falls",,,0,
Atomic structure,38,G-XEC-2018-21,NUM,31,Given: lattice parameter of iron is 0.287 nm. The planar atomic density(in $nm^(-2)$) in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal is ? (give answer up to 2 decimal places).," To find the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a body-centered cubic (BCC) iron crystal, we need to use the lattice parameter to calculate the area of the (110) plane and then determine how many atoms fit into this area.

For a BCC crystal, the (110) plane contains atoms in a square arrangement, and each unit cell contributes 1/2 atom to the (110) plane because the atom at the center of the cube is shared with the adjacent unit cell.

Here's how to calculate the planar atomic density:

1. Calculate the area of the (110) plane using the lattice parameter (a = 0.287 nm). The interplanar spacing (d) for the (110) plane in a BCC structure is given by:
\[ d_{110} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} \]
where (hkl) are the Miller indices of the plane. For the (110) plane, \( h = 1, k = 1, l = 0 \), so:
\[ d_{110} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ d_{110} = \frac{0.287 \text{ nm}}{\sqrt{2}} \]

2. Calculate the area (A) of the (110) plane for one unit cell:
\[ A = a^2 \]
\[ A = (0.287 \text{ nm})^2 \]

3. Determine the number of atoms per unit cell in the (110) plane. For BCC, there are 2 atoms per unit cell, but only 1/2 of each atom is in the (110) plane, so there is effectively 1 atom per unit cell contributing to the (110) plane.

4. Calculate the planar atomic density (\( \rho \)):
\[ \rho = \frac{\text{Number of atoms in the plane}}{\text{Area of the plane}} \]
\[ \rho = \frac{1}{A} \]
\[ \rho = \frac{1}{(0.287 \text{ nm})^2} \]

Now let's do the calculations:

\[ d_{110} = \frac{0.287 \text{ nm}}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.203 \text{ nm} \]
\[ A = (0.287 \text{ nm})^2 \approx 0.082369 \text{ nm}^2 \]
\[ \rho = \frac{1}{0.082369 \text{ nm}^2} \approx 12.14 \text{ nm}^{-2} \]

So, the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal is approximately 12.14 atoms per square nanometer. Here is the answer in a list as requested:

Atomic structure,39,G-XEC-2020-12,MCQS-NUM,44,"Consider an FCC structured metal with lattice parameter a = 3.5 Å. If the material is irradiated using X-rays of wavelength λ = 1.54056 Å, the Bragg angle (2θ) corresponding to the fourth reflection will be:  (A) 88.21° (B) 76.99° (C) 99.35° (D) 93.80°"," To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg's law, which relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to the spacing between crystal planes and the angle at which the radiation is diffracted. Bragg's law is given by:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where:
- n is the order of the reflection (in this case, n = 4 for the fourth reflection),
- λ is the wavelength of the X-rays (1.54056 Å),
- d is the spacing between the crystal planes,
- θ is the angle of incidence (and reflection) of the X-rays.

For an FCC (face-centered cubic) structured metal, the spacing between the {hkl} planes can be calculated using the lattice parameter a and the Miller indices of the planes. However, for the {111} planes in an FCC structure, which are typically the planes responsible for the strongest reflections, the spacing d is given by:

d_{111} = a / (3^(1/2))

Given that the lattice parameter a is 3.5 Å, we can calculate d_{111}:

d_{111} = 3.5 Å / (3^(1/2)) ≈ 3.5 Å / 1.732 ≈ 2.019 Å

Now we can use Bragg's law to find the Bragg angle (2θ) for the fourth reflection:

4λ = 2d sin(θ)
2λ = d sin(θ)
sin(θ) = 2λ / d

Substituting the known values:

sin(θ) = 2 * 1.54056 Å / 2.019 Å
sin(θ) ≈ 1.54056

Since the sine of an angle cannot be greater than 1, we must have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's correct this by dividing by 2 to find the sine of the angle θ (not 2θ):

sin(θ) = λ / d
sin(θ) = 1.54056 Å / (2.019 Å * 2)
sin(θ) ≈ 1.54056 Å / 4.038 Å
sin(θ) ≈ 0.3816

Now we can find the angle θ:

θ = arcsin(0.3816)
θ ≈ 22.54°

Since the Bragg angle is 2θ, we need to double this value:

2θ ≈ 2 * 22.54° ≈ 45.08°

This value does not match any of the given options. It seems we have made another mistake. Let's try the calculation again, this time correctly using the fourth reflection in Bragg's law:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)
4λ = 2d sin(θ)
2λ = d sin(θ)
sin(θ) = 2λ / d

We already calculated d_{111} to be approximately 2.019 Å, so let's use that value:

sin(θ) = 2 * 1.54056 Å / 2.019 Å
sin(θ) ≈ 1.54056 / 2.019
sin(θ) ≈ 0.7634

Now we can find the angle θ:

θ = arcsin(0.7634)
θ ≈ 49.77°

Now, to find the Bragg angle (2θ):

2θ ≈ 2 * 49.77° ≈ 99.54°

This value is very close to option (C) 99.35°, but it does not exactly match. Given that the options provided are likely rounded to two decimal places, option (C) 99.35° is the closest answer to our calculated value. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Atomic structure,40,G-XEC-2020-15,NUM,35,"For a FCC metal, the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface is? (round off to two decimal places). Assume that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy. "," To solve this question, we need to calculate the surface energy for both the {111} and {100} planes of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) metal and then find their ratio. The surface energy is proportional to the number of broken bonds per unit area when a surface is created.

For an FCC metal, each atom has 12 nearest neighbors (coordination number is 12).

**For the {111} plane:**
- Each atom on the surface has 9 nearest neighbors (3 in the same plane, 3 in the plane below, and 3 in the plane above).
- Therefore, 3 bonds are broken per surface atom.
- The area of the unit cell projected onto the {111} plane is √3/2 a², where a is the lattice parameter.
- Since there are 4 atoms per FCC unit cell, and the {111} plane intersects 3 of the 4 atoms, the number of atoms per unit area is (3 atoms) / (√3/2 a²) = 6/(√3 a²).

**For the {100} plane:**
- Each atom on the surface has 8 nearest neighbors (4 in the same plane, 4 in the plane below).
- Therefore, 4 bonds are broken per surface atom.
- The area of the unit cell projected onto the {100} plane is a².
- Since there are 4 atoms per FCC unit cell, and the {100} plane intersects 1 of the 4 atoms, the number of atoms per unit area is (1 atom) / (a²).

Now, let's calculate the ratio of surface energies:

Surface energy is proportional to the number of broken bonds per unit area. So, for the {111} plane, the surface energy γ{111} is proportional to 3 bonds/atom * 6/(√3 a²) atoms/area. For the {100} plane, the surface energy γ{100} is proportional to 4 bonds/atom * 1/(a²) atoms/area.

The ratio of surface energies is then:

γ{111} / γ{100} = (3 bonds/atom * 6/(√3 a²) atoms/area) / (4 bonds/atom * 1/(a²) atoms/area)

Simplifying this, we get:

γ{111} / γ{100} = (3 * 6) / (4 * √3)
γ{111} / γ{100} = 18 / (4 * √3)
γ{111} / γ{100} = 18 / (4 * 1.732)
γ{111} / γ{100} = 18 / 6.928
γ{111} / γ{100} ≈ 2.60

Rounded off to two decimal places, the ratio of surface energy of the {111} surface to the {100} surface is approximately 2.60.

Fe - 10 atom % C austenite (fcc), having no Fe vacancies, has a lattice parameter of 4 Å. The density of austenite in g $cm^(−3)$ is? (round off to 2 decimal places) "," To calculate the density of the austenite, we need to find the mass of the unit cell and then divide it by the volume of the unit cell.

Given:
- Atomic weight of Fe = 55.8
- Atomic weight of C = 12.0
- Avogadro's number = 6.023 × 10^(23)
- Lattice parameter (austenite, fcc) = 4 Å
- Austenite composition: 10 atom % C and 90 atom % Fe

First, we need to calculate the mass of the unit cell. Since austenite has an fcc structure, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. Given the composition, we have:

- 90% Fe atoms: 0.9 * 4 = 3.6 Fe atoms per unit cell
- 10% C atoms: 0.1 * 4 = 0.4 C atoms per unit cell

Now, we calculate the mass of Fe and C in the unit cell:

Mass of Fe in the unit cell = (3.6 atoms Fe) * (55.8 g/mol Fe) / (6.023 × 10^(23) atoms/mol)
Mass of C in the unit cell = (0.4 atoms C) * (12.0 g/mol C) / (6.023 × 10^(23) atoms/mol)

Next, we add the masses of Fe and C to get the total mass of the unit cell:

Total mass of the unit cell = Mass of Fe + Mass of C

Now, we calculate the volume of the unit cell. Since the lattice parameter (a) is 4 Å, the volume (V) of the fcc unit cell is:

V = a^3 = (4 × 10^(-8) cm)^3

Finally, the density (ρ) is given by the mass divided by the volume:

ρ = Total mass of the unit cell / V

Let's do the calculations:

Mass of Fe in the unit cell = (3.6) * (55.8) / (6.023 × 10^(23)) ≈ 3.347 × 10^(-22) g
Mass of C in the unit cell = (0.4) * (12.0) / (6.023 × 10^(23)) ≈ 7.979 × 10^(-24) g

Total mass of the unit cell ≈ 3.347 × 10^(-22) g + 7.979 × 10^(-24) g ≈ 3.427 × 10^(-22) g

Volume of the unit cell = (4 × 10^(-8) cm)^3 = 64 × 10^(-24) cm^3

Density of austenite, ρ = Total mass of the unit cell / V ≈ (3.427 × 10^(-22) g) / (64 × 10^(-24) cm^3) ≈ 53.5469 g/cm^3

The enthalpy required to create an oxygen vacancy in $CeO_2$ is 4 eV. The number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K is? (Round off to the nearest integer)," To find the number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of \( CeO_2 \) at 1000 K, we can use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the probability of a state being occupied to its energy and the temperature.

The Boltzmann distribution is given by:

\[ P(E) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{E}{k_B T}} \]

where:
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of a state with energy \( E \) being occupied,
- \( Z \) is the partition function,
- \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant,
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

For the creation of an oxygen vacancy in \( CeO_2 \), the energy required is \( E = 4 \) eV. We need to convert this energy to joules to be consistent with the units of Boltzmann's constant, which is given in electronvolts per Kelvin (eV/K). The conversion factor is \( 1 \) eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \) J.

\[ E = 4 \text{ eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} \]
\[ E = 6.408 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} \]

Now, we can calculate the probability of an oxygen vacancy being present at 1000 K:

\[ P(E) = e^{-\frac{E}{k_B T}} \]
\[ P(E) = e^{-\frac{6.408 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{(8.62 \times 10^{-5} \text{ eV/K}) \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}) \times 1000 \text{ K}}} \]
\[ P(E) = e^{-\frac{6.408 \times 10^{-19}}{8.62 \times 10^{-5} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 1000}} \]
\[ P(E) = e^{-\frac{6.408}{8.62 \times 1.602}} \]
\[ P(E) = e^{-\frac{6.408}{13.8032}} \]
\[ P(E) = e^{-0.4644} \]
\[ P(E) \approx e^{-0.4644} \]

Now, to find the number of vacancies per mole, we multiply this probability by Avogadro's number \( N_A \):

\[ \text{Number of vacancies per mole} = N_A \times P(E) \]
\[ \text{Number of vacancies per mole} = 6.02 \times 10^{23} \times e^{-0.4644} \]
\[ \text{Number of vacancies per mole} \approx 6.02 \times 10^{23} \times 0.6277 \]
\[ \text{Number of vacancies per mole} \approx 3.77 \times 10^{23} \]

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

\[ \text{Number of vacancies per mole} \approx 3.77 \times 10^{23} \]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a vacancy, we round to the nearest whole number:

\[ \text{Number of vacancies per mole} \approx 4 \times 10^{23} \]

(A) Vacancies (B) Dislocations (C) Stacking faults (D) Grain boundaries ," To answer the question, we need to understand what an equilibrium defect is within the context of materials science. Equilibrium defects are those that are inherent to the material's structure and exist in thermodynamic equilibrium at a given temperature. They are an integral part of the crystal structure and do not cause significant stress or distortion in the lattice.

Here are the options provided, with an explanation for each:

(A) Vacancies: These are atomic sites in a crystal lattice that are not occupied by an atom. Vacancies are equilibrium defects because they are formed during the solidification process and their concentration depends on temperature and the formation energy of the vacancy.

(B) Dislocations: These are linear defects that involve the displacement of a row of atoms from their normal positions. Dislocations are not equilibrium defects; they are typically introduced during plastic deformation and are associated with the storage of energy in the material.

(C) Stacking faults: These occur when the normal sequence of atomic planes in a crystal lattice is interrupted. Stacking faults are not equilibrium defects; they usually arise from the movement of dislocations and are associated with deformation processes.

(D) Grain boundaries: These are the interfaces between two grains (crystallites) in a polycrystalline material. Grain boundaries are not equilibrium defects; they are formed during the solidification and growth processes of the material and their presence is a result of the material's microstructure.

The lattice parameter of the metal is approximately  (A) 0.6 nm (B) 0.4 nm (C) 0.3 nm (D) 0.2 nm"," To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation for X-ray diffraction, which is given by:

\[ n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

where:
- \( n \) is the order of reflection (for a peak corresponding to the {311} planes, we can assume \( n = 1 \) since it's the first-order reflection),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam,
- \( d \) is the spacing between the planes causing the diffraction,
- \( \theta \) is the angle of incidence (also the angle of reflection for elastic scattering).

Given:
- \( \lambda = 0.154 \) nm,
- \( 2\theta = 78^\circ \), so \( \theta = 39^\circ \).

For an fcc (face-centered cubic) crystal, the spacing \( d \) for the {311} planes can be calculated using the lattice parameter \( a \) and the Miller indices \( h, k, l \) as follows:

\[ \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)}{a^2} \]

For the {311} planes, \( h = 3, k = 1, l = 1 \), so:

\[ \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{(3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)}{a^2} = \frac{11}{a^2} \]

\[ d^2 = \frac{a^2}{11} \]

\[ d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{11}} \]

Now, we can plug this expression for \( d \) into the Bragg equation:

\[ \lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

\[ \lambda = 2\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{11}}\right)\sin(\theta) \]

Solving for \( a \):

\[ a = \frac{\lambda\sqrt{11}}{2\sin(\theta)} \]

\[ a = \frac{0.154 \text{ nm} \sqrt{11}}{2\sin(39^\circ)} \]

Now, we calculate the value of \( a \):

\[ a = \frac{0.154 \text{ nm} \times \sqrt{11}}{2 \times \sin(39^\circ)} \]

\[ a \approx \frac{0.154 \text{ nm} \times 3.317}{2 \times 0.6293} \]

\[ a \approx \frac{0.5103 \text{ nm}}{1.2586} \]

The correct combination of the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations for a given unit dislocation having Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0] is  (A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1] (B) (a/6)[1 -1 2] and (a/6)[-1 -2 1] (C) (a/6)[1 1 -2] and (a/6)[2 -1 -1] (D) (a/6)[2 1 1] and (a/6)[1 2 -1]," To solve this question, we need to ensure that the sum of the Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations equals the Burgers vector of the original unit dislocation. The Burgers vector for the unit dislocation is given as (a/2)[1 -1 0].

Let's check each of the given options to see which pair of Burgers vectors for the partial dislocations adds up to the original Burgers vector.

(A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]
(B) (a/6)[1 -1 2] and (a/6)[-1 -2 1]
(C) (a/6)[1 1 -2] and (a/6)[2 -1 -1]
(D) (a/6)[2 1 1] and (a/6)[1 2 -1]

We will add the components of the Burgers vectors for each option and compare them to the components of the original Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0].

For option (A):
(a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] = (a/6)[3 -3 0]
When we multiply this by 2 to compare it with the original Burgers vector (which is (a/2) times 1), we get:
(a/3)[3 -3 0] = (a/2)[2 -2 0]
This is not equal to (a/2)[1 -1 0].

For option (B):
(a/6)[1 -1 2] + (a/6)[-1 -2 1] = (a/6)[0 -3 3]
When we multiply this by 2, we get:
(a/3)[0 -6 6] = (a/2)[0 -3 3]
This is not equal to (a/2)[1 -1 0].

For option (C):
(a/6)[1 1 -2] + (a/6)[2 -1 -1] = (a/6)[3 0 -3]
When we multiply this by 2, we get:
(a/3)[3 0 -3] = (a/2)[2 0 -2]
This is not equal to (a/2)[1 -1 0].

For option (D):
(a/6)[2 1 1] + (a/6)[1 2 -1] = (a/6)[3 3 0]
When we multiply this by 2, we get:
(a/3)[3 3 0] = (a/2)[2 2 0]
This is not equal to (a/2)[1 -1 0].

It seems that none of the options (A), (B), (C), or (D) give the correct combination of Burgers vectors that would sum to the original Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0]. However, since we are looking for the correct answer and one of these options must be correct by the nature of the question, let's re-evaluate our calculations, especially considering the magnitude and direction of the vectors.

Re-evaluating option (A):
(a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] = (a/6)[3 -3 0]
This is indeed equal to (a/2)[1 -1 0] when considering the magnitude and direction, as the vector (a/6)[3 -3 0] is twice the magnitude of (a/2)[1 -1 0] in the same direction.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]

The final answer is:

- [(a/6)[2 -1 1], (a/6)[1 -2 -1]]",,,0,

Atomic structure,48,G-META-12-52,MCQS-NUM,42,A material with grain size of ASTM No. 6 has a lattice frictional stress 100 MN/$m^2$ and locking parameter (Hall-Petch constant) 0.10 MN/$m^(1.5)$. Grain size of the material is approximately  (A) 45 µm (B) 35 µm (C) 4.5 µm (D) 3.5 µm," To solve this question, we need to use the Hall-Petch relationship, which relates the yield strength of a material to its grain size. The Hall-Petch equation is given by:

\[ \sigma_y = \sigma_0 + k \cdot d^{-1/2} \]

where:
- \( \sigma_y \) is the yield strength of the material,
- \( \sigma_0 \) is the lattice frictional stress (also known as the friction stress),
- \( k \) is the Hall-Petch constant (also known as the locking parameter),
- \( d \) is the average grain diameter.

Given:
- \( \sigma_0 = 100 \) MN/\( m^2 \),
- \( k = 0.10 \) MN/\( m^{1.5} \),
- The material has a grain size of ASTM No. 6.

We need to find the corresponding grain size for ASTM No. 6. The ASTM grain size number is a logarithmic scale, and the relationship between the ASTM grain size number \( G \) and the average grain diameter \( d \) in micrometers is given by:

\[ d = 2^{(G-1)} \]

For ASTM No. 6:
\[ d = 2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32 \) µm

Now that we have the grain size, we can check if the yield strength calculated using the Hall-Petch equation matches with the given options for the grain size. However, since we are only given the grain size and not the yield strength, we can assume that the yield strength is not required to answer the question. The question is asking for the grain size corresponding to ASTM No. 6, which we have already calculated.

Therefore, the correct answer is the one that matches the calculated grain size of 32 µm. Looking at the options provided:

(A) 45 µm
(B) 35 µm
(C) 4.5 µm
(D) 3.5 µm

None of the options exactly match the calculated grain size of 32 µm. However, this could be a case where the options are not exhaustive or there might be a rounding error. The closest option to 32 µm is:

(B) 35 µm

Since the question specifies that the grain size is ""approximately,"" we will choose the closest approximate value provided in the options.

Atomic structure,51,G-META-13-22,NUM,9,The atomic packing fraction of diamond cubic structure is?," The atomic packing fraction (APF) is a measure of how efficiently atoms are packed in a crystal structure. It is defined as the ratio of the volume of atoms in a unit cell to the volume of the unit cell itself.

For a diamond cubic structure, which is a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice with a basis of two atoms, the atomic packing fraction can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the volume of the unit cell. For a cubic system, this is simply the cube of the lattice parameter \( a \):
   \[ V_{unit cell} = a^3 \]

2. Calculate the volume of the atoms in the unit cell. In the diamond cubic structure, there are eight corner atoms and six face-centered atoms, but each corner atom is shared by eight unit cells, and each face-centered atom is shared by two unit cells. Therefore, there are a total of 8 corner atoms / 8 + 6 face-centered atoms / 2 = 4 atoms per unit cell.

   The volume of one atom can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere:
   \[ V_{atom} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the atom. Since there are 4 atoms per unit cell, the total volume occupied by atoms is:
   \[ V_{atoms} = 4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \]

3. The atomic packing fraction is then:
   \[ APF = \frac{V_{atoms}}{V_{unit cell}} \]

   Substituting the expressions for \( V_{atoms} \) and \( V_{unit cell} \), we get:
   \[ APF = \frac{4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}{a^3} \]

4. In the diamond cubic structure, the relationship between the lattice parameter \( a \) and the atomic radius \( r \) is:
   \[ a = 2\sqrt{3}r \]

   Substituting this into the APF equation, we get:
   \[ APF = \frac{4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}{(2\sqrt{3}r)^3} \]
   \[ APF = \frac{4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}{8\sqrt{3}^3 r^3} \]
   \[ APF = \frac{4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi}{8 \times 3\sqrt{3}} \]
   \[ APF = \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}} \]

5. Calculating the numerical value:
   \[ APF = \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3 \times 1.73205} \approx \frac{3.14159}{5.19615} \approx 0.605 \]

Therefore, the atomic packing fraction of a diamond cubic structure is approximately 0.605, or 60.5%.

Atomic structure,52,G-META-13-29,MCQS-NUM,30,A unit cell of an element has maximum linear density along the [110] direction. The packing density of its (100) plane is  (A) 0.68 (B) 0.74 (C) 0.79 (D) 0.91 ," To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of linear density and packing density in the context of crystal structures.

The linear density along a direction in a crystal lattice is determined by the number of atoms per unit length along that direction. The packing density of a plane, on the other hand, is the fraction of the area of the plane that is occupied by the atoms' cross-section.

The question states that the unit cell has maximum linear density along the [110] direction. This direction is one of the close-packed directions in a cubic close-packed (ccp) or face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice. In the fcc lattice, the [110] direction corresponds to the close-packed planes stacked in an ABAB... sequence.

The packing density of the (100) plane in an fcc lattice can be determined by considering the arrangement of atoms in that plane. In the (100) plane of an fcc lattice, the atoms are arranged in a square pattern. However, this plane is not as closely packed as the (111) plane, which is the most closely packed plane in an fcc lattice.

The packing density of the (111) plane in an fcc lattice is 0.91, which corresponds to option (D). This is because the atoms in the (111) plane are arranged in a hexagonal compact arrangement, and the centers of the atoms form equilateral triangles. The packing density is calculated as the area occupied by the atoms divided by the total area of the plane.

Since the (100) plane is less densely packed than the (111) plane, its packing density must be less than 0.91. The correct packing density for the (100) plane in an fcc lattice is 0.78, which is not one of the given options. However, since we are asked to choose from the given options, we need to select the closest value to 0.78.

Given the options provided:
- (A) 0.68
- (B) 0.74
- (C) 0.79
- (D) 0.91

The correct answer would be (C) 0.79, as it is the closest to the actual packing density of the (100) plane in an fcc lattice.

Therefore, the answer is:

In an FCC crystal, the planes that typically give rise to the first two peaks in an XRD pattern are the {111} and {200} planes. The interplanar spacing (d-spacing) for these planes in an FCC crystal can be calculated using the lattice parameter (a), which is the length of the side of the unit cell.

For an FCC crystal:
- The d-spacing for the {111} planes is given by \( d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \)
- The d-spacing for the {200} planes is given by \( d_{200} = \frac{a}{2} \)

The ratio of the d-spacings for the first two peaks (from {111} and {200} planes) is therefore:
\[ \frac{d_{200}}{d_{111}} = \frac{\frac{a}{2}}{\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \]

However, the question asks for the ratio of the interplanar spacings obtained from the first two peaks, which is the inverse of the ratio we just calculated:
\[ \frac{d_{111}}{d_{200}} = \frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{a}{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.155 \]

This value is very close to option (D) 1.15. Given that the ratios are theoretical values and experimental results may vary slightly due to measurement uncertainties, the correct answer to the question is:

1. **Orange-peel effect (P)**: This is a surface finish defect that looks like the skin of an orange. It is often associated with casting or forming processes where the surface does not flow enough to become smooth. Among the options, deep drawing (2) is a process that can cause this effect due to the stretching of the material.

2. **Chevron cracking (Q)**: This type of cracking is characterized by a V-shaped pattern and is typically associated with stress concentrations in materials. Arc welding (3) can lead to this type of cracking due to the thermal stresses and metallurgical changes in the heat-affected zone.

3. **Flash (R)**: Flash is excess material that forms at the parting lines of molds or dies during the manufacturing process. Forging (4) can cause flash where the workpiece is squeezed between the dies.

4. **Undercut (S)**: An undercut is a recess or a cutout in a part that can be created intentionally or unintentionally. In the context of manufacturing processes, undercuts can be challenging in molding and casting processes. Extrusion (1) is not typically associated with undercuts; instead, it is a continuous process that forces material through a die to create a desired cross-section.

Based on the above analysis, the correct matches are:

- Orange-peel effect (P) with Deep drawing (2)
- Chevron cracking (Q) with Arc welding (3)
- Flash (R) with Forging (4)
- Undercut (S) does not have a direct match with the given processes, but if we consider the creation of an undercut during a process, it could be associated with the complexity of the die or mold design, which could be a challenge in Forging (4) or Extrusion (1).

Atomic structure,55,G-META-13-54,MCQS-NUM,38,An edge dislocation is present in α-Fe. Atomic diameter of iron atom is 0.25 nm and its shear modulus is 70 GPa. Modulus of the Burgers vector (in nm) is  (A) 0.125 (B) 0.25 (C) 0.50 (D) 0.625 ," To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of the Burgers vector in relation to an edge dislocation and how it relates to the shear modulus and the atomic diameter of the material.

The Burgers vector (b) is a measure of the strength of a dislocation. It represents the magnitude and direction of the lattice distortion associated with the dislocation. For an edge dislocation in a simple cubic lattice, the Burgers vector is equal to one lattice spacing, which is also the diameter of the atom in the direction of the dislocation line.

Given that the atomic diameter of an iron atom is 0.25 nm, this is the magnitude of the Burgers vector for an edge dislocation in α-Fe, assuming a simple cubic structure. However, α-Fe (alpha iron) has a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, and for a BCC lattice, the Burgers vector for an edge dislocation is not simply the atomic diameter but rather the distance between two adjacent atoms along the close-packed direction, which is the face diagonal of the cube.

For a BCC lattice, the face diagonal can be calculated using the atomic diameter (d) as follows:

Face diagonal, \( a = \sqrt{2} \times d \)

Since the atomic diameter is given as 0.25 nm:

\( a = \sqrt{2} \times 0.25 \text{ nm} \)

\( a = 0.25 \text{ nm} \times 1.414 \)

\( a = 0.3535 \text{ nm} \)

However, the Burgers vector for an edge dislocation in a BCC lattice is not the face diagonal but rather the lattice parameter (the length of the edge of the unit cell). The lattice parameter for a BCC lattice is related to the atomic diameter by the following relationship:

Lattice parameter, \( a_{\text{BCC}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times d \)

\( a_{\text{BCC}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 0.25 \text{ nm} \)

\( a_{\text{BCC}} = 0.25 \text{ nm} \times 0.866 \)

\( a_{\text{BCC}} = 0.2165 \text{ nm} \)

Now, the modulus of the Burgers vector (|b|) can be related to the shear modulus (G) and the edge dislocation's energy per unit length (E_d) using the following relationship derived from elasticity theory:

\( E_d = \frac{G \cdot b^2}{4\pi(1-\nu)} \)

where ν is Poisson's ratio. However, we don't need to use this relationship directly because we've already determined the lattice parameter, which is the magnitude of the Burgers vector for an edge dislocation in a BCC lattice.

Therefore, the modulus of the Burgers vector for α-Fe is approximately 0.2165 nm, which is not one of the options provided. Since the options seem to be multiples of the atomic diameter, it's possible that the question is asking for the magnitude of the Burgers vector in terms of the atomic diameter for a simple cubic lattice, rather than the actual value for a BCC lattice.

Given the options and assuming the question is simplified for a simple cubic lattice, the correct answer would be the atomic diameter itself, which is 0.25 nm, since the Burgers vector for a simple cubic lattice is one atomic diameter.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 0.25.

\[ E = \frac{G \cdot b^2}{4 \cdot \pi \cdot (1 - \nu)} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{R}{r_0}\right) \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy per unit length of the dislocation,
- \( G \) is the shear modulus,
- \( b \) is the Burgers vector (which is approximately equal to the atomic diameter for a simple edge dislocation),
- \( \nu \) is Poisson's ratio (which we don't have, but a typical value for metals is around 0.3),
- \( R \) is the outer cut-off radius (often taken as half the distance to the next dislocation),
- \( r_0 \) is the inner cut-off radius (often taken as the radius of the dislocation core, typically a few atomic distances).

Given:
- Atomic diameter of iron atom, \( d = 0.25 \) nm, so \( b = 0.25 \times 10^{-9} \) m,
- Shear modulus, \( G = 70 \) GPa = \( 70 \times 10^9 \) N/m².

We don't have the values for \( R \), \( r_0 \), or \( \nu \), but we can still estimate the energy per unit length using typical values for \( R \) and \( r_0 \). Let's assume \( \nu = 0.3 \), \( R = 10^{-6} \) m (a micrometer, which is a reasonable distance between dislocations in a material), and \( r_0 = 10 \times b \) (which is a typical assumption for the core radius).

Plugging in the values:

\[ E = \frac{70 \times 10^9 \cdot (0.25 \times 10^{-9})^2}{4 \cdot \pi \cdot (1 - 0.3)} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{10^{-6}}{10 \cdot 0.25 \times 10^{-9}}\right) \]

\[ E = \frac{70 \times 10^9 \cdot (0.0625 \times 10^{-18})}{4 \cdot \pi \cdot 0.7} \cdot \ln\left(400\right) \]

\[ E = \frac{70 \times 10^9 \cdot (0.0625 \times 10^{-18})}{8.796} \cdot \ln\left(400\right) \]

\[ E = \frac{70 \times 0.0625 \times 10^{-9}}{8.796} \cdot \ln\left(400\right) \]

\[ E = \frac{4.46875 \times 10^{-9}}{8.796} \cdot \ln\left(400\right) \]

\[ E = 0.508 \times 10^{-9} \cdot \ln\left(400\right) \]

\[ E \approx 0.508 \times 10^{-9} \cdot 5.991 \]

\[ E \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-9} \]

The actual value of \( E \) will depend on the precise values of \( R \), \( r_0 \), and \( \nu \), but given the assumptions and the order of magnitude calculation, the energy per unit length of the dislocation is on the order of \( 10^{-9} \) J/m.

Dislocation density is a measure of the amount of dislocation in a crystal. It is defined as the total dislocation line length per unit volume. Since the unit of length is meters (m) and the unit of volume is cubic meters (m³), dislocation density is measured in meters of dislocation line per cubic meter of volume, which simplifies to 1/m². Therefore, the unit for dislocation density is:

- $m^(-2)$

The stress intensity factor is a parameter that characterizes the magnitude of the stress field around a crack tip. It is used in fracture mechanics to predict the stress state near the crack tip. The stress intensity factor has the units of stress (measured in pascals, Pa) times the square root of length (measured in meters, m). Therefore, the unit for stress intensity factor is:

- Pa.$m^(1/2)$ or MPa.$m^(1/2)$ (since 1 MPa = 10^6 Pa)

Atomic structure,60,G-META-14-48,NUM,19,"The atomic radius of aluminium is 1.431 Å. The interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium, in Å, is?"," To calculate the interplanar spacing (d-spacing) of the (111) planes in aluminium, we can use the formula derived from X-ray diffraction for a cubic system:

\[ d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} \]

where:
- \( d_{hkl} \) is the interplanar spacing for the (hkl) planes,
- \( a \) is the lattice parameter (the length of one side of the unit cell),
- \( h, k, l \) are the Miller indices of the plane.

For aluminium, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, the relationship between the atomic radius (r) and the lattice parameter (a) is:

\[ a = 2\sqrt{2} \cdot r \]

Given the atomic radius of aluminium (r) is 1.431 Å, we can calculate the lattice parameter (a):

\[ a = 2\sqrt{2} \cdot 1.431\,Å \]
\[ a = 2 \cdot 1.414 \cdot 1.431\,Å \]
\[ a = 4.000\,Å \]

Now that we have the lattice parameter, we can calculate the interplanar spacing for the (111) planes:

\[ d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} \]
\[ d_{111} = \frac{4.000\,Å}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ d_{111} = \frac{4.000\,Å}{1.732} \]
\[ d_{111} = 2.309\,Å \]

Therefore, the interplanar spacing of the (111) planes in aluminium is approximately 2.309 Å.

Find x"," To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the Burgers vector and the strain energy of a dislocation in a crystal. The strain energy per unit length (E) of a dislocation is proportional to the square of the magnitude of its Burgers vector (b):

\[ E \propto |b|^2 \]

Given that the Burgers vector for the first dislocation is \( \frac{a}{2}\langle110\rangle \) and for the second dislocation is \( \frac{a}{6}\langle112\rangle \), we can calculate the ratio of their strain energies per unit length.

First, we find the magnitude of each Burgers vector:

For \( \frac{a}{2}\langle110\rangle \):
\[ |b_{110}| = \frac{a}{2}\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = \frac{a}{2}\sqrt{2} \]

For \( \frac{a}{6}\langle112\rangle \):
\[ |b_{112}| = \frac{a}{6}\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} = \frac{a}{6}\sqrt{6} \]

Now, we find the ratio of the energies (E1 for \( \frac{a}{2}\langle110\rangle \) and E2 for \( \frac{a}{6}\langle112\rangle \)):

\[ \frac{E1}{E2} = \frac{|b_{110}|^2}{|b_{112}|^2} = \left(\frac{\frac{a}{2}\sqrt{2}}{\frac{a}{6}\sqrt{6}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \]

Therefore, the strain energy per unit length of a \( \frac{a}{2}\langle110\rangle \) dislocation is 9 times that of a \( \frac{a}{6}\langle112\rangle \) dislocation.

The value of x is 9.

The packing efficiency of an HCP structure, which is the fraction of the unit cell volume that is actually occupied by the spheres (atoms), is 74%. This is because in both HCP and face-centered cubic (FCC) structures, which are the two closest packing types, the spheres occupy the same proportion of space.

The angle (in degrees) between the dislocation line and its Burger’s vector is," To find the angle between the dislocation line and its Burgers vector, we can use the dot product formula for vectors in three dimensions. The cosine of the angle θ between two vectors A and B is given by:

\[ \cos(\theta) = \frac{A \cdot B}{|A||B|} \]

where \( A \cdot B \) is the dot product of A and B, and \( |A| \) and \( |B| \) are the magnitudes of A and B, respectively.

The Burgers vector is given as \( \frac{a}{2}[1\ 1\ 0] \), and the dislocation line is along the [112] direction. To find the angle, we need to normalize these vectors first.

The magnitude of the Burgers vector \( b \) is:

\[ |b| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{a^2}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{2}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} \]

The magnitude of the dislocation line vector \( u \) is:

\[ |u| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1 + 4} = \sqrt{6} \]

Now, we can calculate the dot product of the two vectors:

\[ b \cdot u = \left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, 0\right) \cdot (1, 1, 2) = \frac{a}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{a}{2} \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 2 = a \]

Using the dot product formula for the cosine of the angle:

\[ \cos(\theta) = \frac{a}{\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{6}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2 \cdot 3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Now, we find the angle θ:

\[ \theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \]

To convert this to degrees, we multiply by \( \frac{180}{\pi} \):

\[ \theta_{\text{degrees}} = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \times \frac{180}{\pi} \]

Using a calculator, we find:

\[ \theta_{\text{degrees}} \approx \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \times \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 54.74 \text{ degrees} \]

So the angle between the dislocation line and its Burgers vector is approximately 54.74 degrees.

(A) Dislocation pile-up

When a metal crystal undergoes plastic deformation at low temperatures, the primary mechanism responsible for the wavy slip line pattern is the pile-up of dislocations. Dislocation pile-ups occur when dislocations moving on the same slip plane are blocked by an obstacle, such as a grain boundary or a precipitate, causing them to accumulate. This leads to an increase in the local stress concentration, which can eventually lead to the formation of new dislocations or the activation of secondary slip systems. The interaction of these dislocations with each other and with obstacles results in the characteristic wavy slip line pattern observed on the surface of the metal.

Atomic structure,68,G-META-16-50,NUM,24,For a bcc metal the ratio of the surface energy per unit area of the (100) plane to that of the (110) plane is," The surface energy per unit area of a crystal plane is related to the density of atoms on that plane and the strength of the interatomic bonds. In a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, the (100) plane is less densely packed than the (110) plane. The (100) plane has atoms arranged in a square lattice, while the (110) plane has a more closely packed arrangement, resembling a rectangular lattice with rows of atoms closer together.

The surface energy is inversely proportional to the interplanar spacing (d-spacing) for planes with similar atomic packing and bonding characteristics. The d-spacing for the (100) plane is larger than that for the (110) plane, which means that the (100) plane has fewer atoms per unit area compared to the (110) plane.

Given that the surface energy is higher for planes with higher atomic density (since there are more bonds to break per unit area), the surface energy per unit area of the (110) plane should be higher than that of the (100) plane in a bcc metal.

However, to provide a precise ratio, one would typically need to calculate the surface energy based on the specific interatomic potentials and lattice parameters of the bcc metal in question. Since we do not have specific numerical values or a particular bcc metal to reference, we can only state that the ratio of the surface energy per unit area of the (100) plane to that of the (110) plane is less than 1.

To summarize, without specific numerical values, we can conclude:

- The surface energy of the (110) plane is greater than that of the (100) plane due to its higher atomic density.
- The ratio of the surface energy per unit area of the (100) plane to that of the (110) plane is less than 1.

Since we cannot provide an exact numerical ratio without additional information, the answer list will reflect only the qualitative relationship:

Atomic structure,69,G-META-17-11,NUM,31,"Given: lattice parameter = 0.401 nm. For a FCC metal, radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void (in nm) is? (answer up to three decimal places)"," To find the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void of a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal, we need to understand the geometry of the FCC unit cell and the tetrahedral void within it.

In an FCC unit cell, the atoms are arranged such that each atom touches the atoms at the corners of an octahedron. The tetrahedral void is formed by four atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The radius of the sphere that can fit into the tetrahedral void, \( r_{void} \), is what we're looking to find.

The radius of the sphere that can fit into the tetrahedral void can be related to the radius of the atom in the FCC lattice, \( r_{atom} \), and the lattice parameter, \( a \), which is the length of the side of the unit cell.

For an FCC lattice, the relationship between the lattice parameter \( a \) and the atomic radius \( r_{atom} \) is:
\[ a = 2\sqrt{2} \cdot r_{atom} \]

The radius of the tetrahedral void, \( r_{void} \), is smaller than the atomic radius because the sphere fitting into the void touches the atoms at the corners of the tetrahedron. The ratio of \( r_{void} \) to \( r_{atom} \) for a tetrahedral void is \( \sqrt{6}/4 \). Therefore:
\[ r_{void} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} \cdot r_{atom} \]

Using the given lattice parameter \( a = 0.401 \) nm, we can solve for \( r_{atom} \):
\[ r_{atom} = \frac{a}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{0.401 \text{ nm}}{2\sqrt{2}} \]

Now we calculate \( r_{atom} \):
\[ r_{atom} = \frac{0.401 \text{ nm}}{2\sqrt{2}} \approx \frac{0.401 \text{ nm}}{2.828} \approx 0.1418 \text{ nm} \]

Next, we use \( r_{atom} \) to find \( r_{void} \):
\[ r_{void} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} \cdot r_{atom} \approx \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} \cdot 0.1418 \text{ nm} \]

Calculating \( r_{void} \):
\[ r_{void} \approx \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} \cdot 0.1418 \text{ nm} \approx \frac{2.4495}{4} \cdot 0.1418 \text{ nm} \approx 0.1575 \text{ nm} \]

Rounding to three decimal places, the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void is approximately:

\[ r_{void} \approx 0.158 \text{ nm} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

- \( r_{void} \approx 0.158 \) nm

Atomic structure,70,G-META-17-13,NUM,30,"A cubic metal has density of 19000 kg.$m^(-3)$, lattice paramter of 0.4nm and atomic weight of 183. The effective number of atoms in an unit cell of this metal is?"," To find the effective number of atoms in a unit cell of the metal, we can use the density of the metal, the lattice parameter, and the atomic weight.

First, we need to calculate the volume of the unit cell. Since the lattice parameter (a) is given as 0.4 nm (which is 0.4 x 10^-9 m), and the metal has a cubic structure, the volume (V) of the unit cell is:

\[ V = a^3 = (0.4 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m})^3 = 64 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{m}^3 \]

Next, we need to find the mass of the unit cell. We can do this by multiplying the density (ρ) by the volume (V):

\[ \text{Mass of unit cell} = \rho \times V = 19000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-3} \times 64 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{m}^3 \]
\[ \text{Mass of unit cell} = 1.216 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg} \]

Now, we need to find out how many atoms are in this mass of the metal. We can do this by dividing the mass of the unit cell by the atomic mass (molar mass, M) of the metal:

\[ \text{Number of atoms} = \frac{\text{Mass of unit cell}}{M} = \frac{1.216 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg}}{183 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1}} \]
\[ \text{Number of atoms} = 6.645 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{mol} \]

Since we are dealing with atoms, not moles, we need to multiply by Avogadro's number (NA) to find the number of atoms:

\[ N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \]
\[ \text{Number of atoms in unit cell} = 6.645 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \]
\[ \text{Number of atoms in unit cell} = 0.04002 \, \text{atoms} \]

Since the number of atoms in a unit cell must be a whole number, and we have calculated approximately 0.04 atoms per unit cell, this suggests that there is effectively less than one atom per unit cell. However, we know that there must be a whole number of atoms in a unit cell. This discrepancy arises due to the fact that the unit cell shares atoms with neighboring unit cells.

For a cubic system, the effective number of atoms in a unit cell can be 1 for a simple cubic (SC) lattice, 2 for a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, and 4 for a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. Since we have less than one atom per unit cell, it is clear that the metal cannot have a BCC or FCC structure, as these would give us more than one atom per unit cell.

Therefore, the metal must have a simple cubic structure, and the effective number of atoms in the unit cell is 1.

The slip systems in an FCC crystal involve the movement of planes with the highest atomic density, which are the {111} planes, and the close-packed directions in these planes are the <110> directions.

The given slip systems are represented by the slip direction and the slip plane. The slip direction is given as a/2<uvw>, and the slip plane is represented by the Miller indices (hkl).

Let's analyze each option:

(B) a/2 [0 1 1](1 1 -1)
(C) a/2[0 1 1](1 -1 1)
(D) a/2[1 1 0](-1 1 -1)

For the slip to occur, the slip direction must be parallel to the direction of the applied stress, or as close to parallel as possible, and the slip plane must be oriented such that it can accommodate the shear caused by the stress.

Given the tensile stress along the [110] direction, we look for the slip direction that is closest to [110]. Options (A) and (D) have slip directions that are perpendicular to the tensile stress direction ([110] is perpendicular to [-110] and [1-10]), so these are less likely to be activated.

Between options (B) and (C), we need to determine which slip plane is better oriented to the tensile stress. The slip plane that is most favorably oriented will have its normal vector at a smaller angle to the tensile stress direction.

For option (B), the slip plane normal is [1 1 -1], and for option (C), it is [1 -1 1]. To find the angle between the slip plane normals and the tensile stress direction [110], we can use the dot product.

However, without going through the calculations, we can visually inspect the slip systems and notice that option (B) has a slip direction [011] that is not parallel to the tensile stress direction [110].

(A) {1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0>
(B) {1 -1 0 0} <0 0 0 2>
(C) {0 0 0 1} <1 1 -2 0>
(D) {1 0 -1 -1} <1 1 -2 3>

Let's analyze them:

(A) This is a basal slip system with the most common and shortest Burgers vector for hcp metals. The slip plane is {1 -1 0 0}, which is the basal plane, and the slip direction is <1 1 -2 0>, which is the shortest lattice vector in the basal plane.

(B) This slip system also operates on the basal plane {1 -1 0 0}, but the slip direction is <0 0 0 2>, which is not a common slip direction and is longer than the <1 1 -2 0> direction.

(C) This slip system operates on the prismatic plane {0 0 0 1}, with the slip direction <1 1 -2 0>. While prismatic slip can occur in hcp metals, it is generally less common than basal slip.

(D) This slip system operates on the pyramidal plane {1 0 -1 -1} with a slip direction <1 1 -2 3>. This is a less common slip system and involves a longer Burgers vector than the basal slip direction.

Given that Zn has a c/a ratio greater than the ideal, it tends to favor basal slip because the c-axis is elongated, making it easier for dislocations to glide on the basal plane. Therefore, the slip system most likely to be active at room temperature in Zn would be:

(A) {1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0>

This is the basal slip system with the shortest Burgers vector, which is typically the most active in hcp metals with a c/a ratio greater than ideal, such as Zn.

Assertion [A]: For a material exhibiting Coble creep, a reduction in grain size results in a significant increase in creep rate.

Coble creep is a type of diffusion creep that occurs at high temperatures and low stresses. In Coble creep, the rate-controlling mechanism is the diffusion of atoms through the grain boundaries. When the grain size is reduced, the total area of grain boundaries increases for a given volume of material. Since grain boundaries provide a fast path for diffusion compared to the lattice, a smaller grain size leads to an increased rate of diffusion and, consequently, an increased creep rate. Therefore, the assertion is true: a reduction in grain size does result in a significant increase in creep rate for materials undergoing Coble creep.

Reason [R]: Grain boundaries act as a barrier to motion of dislocations.

This statement is generally true in the context of plastic deformation. Grain boundaries can indeed act as barriers to the motion of dislocations, which are line defects in the crystal structure. When a dislocation encounters a grain boundary, it can be impeded or even stopped, which is why smaller grain sizes can strengthen materials and make them more resistant to plastic deformation (this is known as the Hall-Petch effect). However, this reason is not directly related to Coble creep, which is controlled by grain boundary diffusion rather than dislocation motion.

Given the analysis:

- Assertion [A] is true for Coble creep.
- Reason [R] is true but does not explain why the creep rate increases with a reduction in grain size in Coble creep.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

What is the wavelength of X-rays in nm rounded off to three decimal places? Given: The lattice parameter of iron = 0.287 nm"," To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg's law for diffraction, which is given by:

\[ n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

where:
- \( n \) is the order of the reflection (for the first peak, \( n = 1 \)),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the X-rays,
- \( d \) is the spacing between the planes in the crystal, and
- \( \theta \) is the angle of incidence (and reflection) of the X-rays.

For a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, the spacing \( d \) for the (110) planes, which are the planes responsible for the first peak in a BCC lattice, is given by:

\[ d_{110} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} \]

where \( a \) is the lattice parameter, and \( h, k, l \) are the Miller indices of the plane. For the (110) planes, \( h = 1, k = 1, l = 0 \), so:

\[ d_{110} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} \]

Given that the lattice parameter \( a \) for iron is 0.287 nm, we can calculate \( d_{110} \):

\[ d_{110} = \frac{0.287 \text{ nm}}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.2031 \text{ nm} \]

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the wavelength \( \lambda \):

\[ \lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

Given that the first peak occurs at \( 2\theta = 68.7^\circ \), we have \( \theta = 68.7^\circ / 2 = 34.35^\circ \). Now we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[ \lambda = 2 \times 0.2031 \text{ nm} \times \sin(34.35^\circ) \]
\[ \lambda \approx 2 \times 0.2031 \text{ nm} \times 0.5655 \]
\[ \lambda \approx 0.2297 \text{ nm} \]

(A) Ionic bonds: These are strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions. Ionic bonds are generally stronger than hydrogen bonds because they involve a complete transfer of electrons, resulting in a strong electrostatic force between the ions.

(B) Metallic bonds: These are the bonds that hold metals together. They are formed by the electrostatic attraction between positively charged metal ions and a ""sea"" of delocalized electrons. Metallic bonds are strong due to the large number of interactions between the cations and the electrons, making them typically stronger than hydrogen bonds.

(C) van der Waals bonds: These are the weakest of the intermolecular forces and include dipole-dipole interactions, London dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are a type of van der Waals force, but they are generally stronger than the other types of van der Waals forces because they involve a partially positively charged hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine.

(D) Covalent bonds: These are bonds formed by the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Covalent bonds are typically stronger than hydrogen bonds because they involve the sharing of electrons, which creates a strong attraction between the nuclei of the bonded atoms.

Given this information, the correct answer is:

- Hydrogen bonds are stronger than van der Waals bonds (excluding hydrogen bonds themselves), as they are a specific and stronger type within the van der Waals category.
- Hydrogen bonds are weaker than ionic bonds, metallic bonds, and covalent bonds.

Atomic structure,77,G-META-19-24,NUM,44,"A FCC crystal with a lattice parameter of 0.3615 nm is used to measure the wavelength of monochromatic X-rays. The Bragg angle (θ) for the reflection from (111) planes is 21.68°. The wavelength of X-rays (in nm, rounded off to three decimal places) is "," To solve for the wavelength of the X-rays using the Bragg equation, we can use the following formula:

\[ n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

where:
- \( n \) is the order of the reflection (for a FCC crystal, the first-order reflection is typically used, so \( n = 1 \)),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the X-rays,
- \( d \) is the spacing between the planes causing the diffraction (in this case, the (111) planes of an FCC crystal),
- \( \theta \) is the Bragg angle.

For an FCC crystal, the spacing \( d \) for the (hkl) planes can be calculated using the lattice parameter \( a \) and the Miller indices (hkl) of the planes:

\[ \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}{a^2} \]

For the (111) planes, \( h = k = l = 1 \), so:

\[ d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Given the lattice parameter \( a = 0.3615 \) nm, we can calculate \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{0.3615 \text{ nm}}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{0.3615}{1.732} \text{ nm} \approx 0.2092 \text{ nm} \]

Now we can use the Bragg equation to find the wavelength \( \lambda \):

\[ \lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

Given \( \theta = 21.68^\circ \) (converted to radians for the sine function):

\[ \theta \text{ in radians} = 21.68^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} \approx 0.3782 \text{ radians} \]

Now we can plug in the values:

\[ \lambda = 2 \times 0.2092 \text{ nm} \times \sin(0.3782) \]
\[ \lambda \approx 2 \times 0.2092 \text{ nm} \times 0.3672 \]
\[ \lambda \approx 0.1539 \text{ nm} \]

(A) (1 1 1)[1 -1 0] (B) (-1 1 1)[0 1 1] (C) (1 -1 1)[1 0 -1] (D) (1 1 -1)[1 0 1]," To determine which of the given options is NOT a valid slip system in a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) copper crystal, we need to understand the characteristics of slip systems in FCC structures.

In FCC crystals, the slip planes are the most densely packed planes, which are the {111} planes. The slip directions are the most densely packed directions within these planes, which are the <110> directions.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) (1 1 1)[1 -1 0] - This is a valid slip system because the slip plane is (1 1 1) and the slip direction is [1 -1 0], which are both consistent with the FCC slip systems.

(B) (-1 1 1)[0 1 1] - This is also a valid slip system. The slip plane is (-1 1 1), which is equivalent to (1 1 1) because the negative sign does not change the plane's identity in Miller index notation. The slip direction [0 1 1] is a <110> type direction.

(C) (1 -1 1)[1 0 -1] - This is a valid slip system as well. The slip plane is (1 -1 1), which is equivalent to (1 1 1), and the slip direction [1 0 -1] is a <110> type direction.

(D) (1 1 -1)[1 0 1] - This option appears to be a valid slip system at first glance because the slip plane (1 1 -1) is a {111} plane and the slip direction [1 0 1] is a <110> direction. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the slip direction [1 0 1] is not a valid <110> direction because it does not lie within the (1 1 -1) plane. In an FCC crystal, the <110> directions that lie within the {111} planes are of the form [1 -1 0], [0 1 -1], and their equivalents due to symmetry. The direction [1 0 1] does not fit this pattern and thus does not represent a valid slip direction in the (1 1 -1) plane.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

In an FCC crystal, dislocations can split into partial dislocations that are separated by a stacking fault. The Burgers vectors of these partial dislocations must be valid lattice vectors in the FCC structure.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) (1/2)[0 -1 1] → (1/6)[1 -2 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]
This reaction suggests that a perfect dislocation with a Burgers vector of (1/2)[0 -1 1] dissociates into two Shockley partial dislocations. This is a feasible reaction in an FCC crystal, as the Burgers vectors of the partials add up to the Burgers vector of the perfect dislocation and are valid lattice vectors for FCC.

(B) (1/2)[1 -1 0] + (1/2)[1 -1 0] → [1 -1 0]
This reaction suggests that two perfect dislocations with Burgers vectors of (1/2)[1 -1 0] combine to form a perfect dislocation with a Burgers vector of [1 -1 0]. This is a feasible reaction in an FCC crystal, as it represents the recombination of two Shockley partials back into a perfect dislocation.

(C) (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] → (1/2)[1 1 0]
This reaction suggests that a Frank partial dislocation with a Burgers vector of (1/3)[1 1 1] combines with another partial dislocation with a Burgers vector of (1/6)[1 1 -2] to form a perfect dislocation with a Burgers vector of (1/2)[1 1 0]. This reaction is feasible in an FCC crystal.

(D) (1/2)[-1 0 1] → (1/6)[-2 1 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]
This reaction suggests that a perfect dislocation with a Burgers vector of (1/2)[-1 0 1] dissociates into two Shockley partial dislocations. This is also a feasible reaction in an FCC crystal, as the Burgers vectors of the partials add up to the Burgers vector of the perfect dislocation and are valid lattice vectors for FCC.

After analyzing each option, we can see that all the reactions (A), (B), (C), and (D) are feasible in an FCC crystal. Therefore, the question seems to be flawed, as all the given dislocation reactions are possible in an FCC crystal structure. There is no option that is NOT feasible.

However, if we must choose an option that is less conventional or more complex, we might consider option (C), as it involves a Frank partial dislocation, which is less common than the Shockley partials involved in the other reactions. But it is important to note that even this reaction is feasible and can occur in an FCC crystal.

Given the context of the question, the correct answer would be that all the reactions are feasible, and there is no option that is not feasible. Therefore, the list of correct answers would be empty, as follows:

Assertion [a]: The rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution of B in A is controlled by the diffusivity of B.

This assertion is true. In a substitutional solid solution, solute atoms (B) replace solvent atoms (A) in the crystal lattice. The rate at which these solute atoms spread throughout the solvent to form a homogeneous mixture is indeed controlled by the diffusion rate of the solute atoms (B). Diffusivity is a measure of how quickly atoms can move through a material, and in the case of a dilute solid solution, the diffusivity of the solute is the limiting factor for homogenization.

Reason [r]: Atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries.

This reason is false. In fact, atomic migration can and does occur along dislocations and grain boundaries. These defects in the crystal structure provide paths of lower activation energy for atomic diffusion compared to the perfect lattice regions. As a result, diffusion is actually enhanced along dislocations and grain boundaries, which is why these areas are often more susceptible to corrosion and other types of degradation.

The grain size (X) of annealed specimens follows a symmetric distribution with a mean (µ) of 5µm and a standard deviation (σ) of 0.5 µm. The percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is expected to be?(round off to nearest integer) ," To solve this problem, we can use the properties of a symmetric distribution, specifically the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule) for a normal distribution, which states that approximately:

- 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (σ) of the mean (µ).
- 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations (2σ) of the mean (µ).
- 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations (3σ) of the mean (µ).

Given that the distribution is symmetric and P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98, we know that the probability of the grain size being within two standard deviations of the mean is 98%.

We are given:
- Mean (µ) = 5µm
- Standard deviation (σ) = 0.5µm

We want to find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm.

First, let's calculate µ + 2σ:
µ + 2σ = 5µm + 2 * 0.5µm = 5µm + 1µm = 6µm

This confirms that the upper limit of our range of interest (6µm) is exactly two standard deviations above the mean.

Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability of X being less than or equal to µ + 2σ is 0.98, which means the probability of X being greater than µ + 2σ is 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 (or 2%).

However, we are interested in the range from µ to µ + 2σ, not from negative infinity to µ + 2σ. Since the distribution is symmetric around the mean, the probability of X being less than µ is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of X being between µ and µ + 2σ is the total probability of X being less than µ + 2σ minus the probability of X being less than µ:

P(µ < X ≤ µ + 2σ) = P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) - P(X < µ)
P(µ < X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98 - 0.5
P(µ < X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.48

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Percentage = 0.48 * 100 = 48%

Rounding to the nearest integer, the expected percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is 48%.

The Shockley partials are \( a_0/2 [-1 -1 1] \) and \( a_0/2 [1 1 1] \), and when they combine, they form a perfect dislocation \( a_0 [ 0 0 1] \). This is a typical reaction in FCC metals and does not lead to a Lomer-Cottrell lock or an energetically unfavorable reaction.

(Q) \( a_0/6 [-1 2 -1 ] + a_0/6 [1 -1 2] = a_0/6 [0 1 1] \)

This reaction involves two Shockley partials that do not combine to form a perfect dislocation. Instead, they form another partial dislocation. This type of reaction is not typical in FCC metals and is often energetically unfavorable because it does not lead to the annihilation of the dislocations.

(R) \( a_0/6 [1 -2 1] + a_0/6 [-1 -1 2] = a_0/2 [0 -1 1] \)

This reaction represents the formation of a Lomer-Cottrell lock in an FCC metal. The two Shockley partials \( a_0/6 [1 -2 1] \) and \( a_0/6 [-1 -1 2] \) react to form a sessile dislocation with the Burgers vector \( a_0/2 [0 -1 1] \). This is a characteristic feature of the Lomer-Cottrell lock, which is a strong obstacle to dislocation motion.

(P) Cottrell atmosphere refers to the segregation of solute atoms to dislocations in a material, which can impede the movement of dislocations and thus affect the material's strength and plasticity. This matches with the description of segregation of solutes to the stacking fault, which is (4).

(Q) Suzuki interaction is not a standard term in materials science. However, the Suzuki effect or Suzuki segregation refers to the segregation of solute atoms to grain boundaries, which can affect the material's properties. This is somewhat related to the stress assisted diffusion of vacancies, but it is not the same as the description given in (2). The closest match from the given options is the segregation of solutes to the stacking fault, which is (4), but this is already matched with the Cottrell atmosphere. Since there is no better match from the given descriptions, we will have to leave this as an imperfect match.

(R) Bauschinger effect is a phenomenon observed in materials where the yield stress decreases when the loading direction is reversed after a period of plastic deformation. This matches with the description of a decrease in yield stress when the loading direction is reversed, which is (1).

(S) Nabarro-Herring creep is a type of diffusion creep that occurs in polycrystalline materials at high temperatures. It involves the diffusion of vacancies through the lattice, which leads to plastic deformation. This matches with the description of stress assisted diffusion of vacancies resulting in plastic deformation in a polycrystalline material, which is (2).

- R - 1 (Bauschinger effect with decrease in yield stress when loading direction is reversed)

Atomic structure,88,G-META-14-31,MCQS,54,Dissociation of a dislocation into two partials in an FCC metal is given by the following equation. (a/2)[1 -1 0] → (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] . On which plane do these two partial dislocaitons lie?  (A) (-1 1 1) (B) (1 1 1) (C) (1 -1 1) (D) (1 1 -1)," To determine the plane on which the two partial dislocations lie after the dissociation of a perfect dislocation in an FCC metal, we need to look at the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations and the slip planes in an FCC crystal.

The dissociation reaction is given by:
(a/2)[1 -1 0] → (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1]

Here, (a/2)[1 -1 0] is the Burgers vector of the perfect dislocation in the FCC lattice, which typically lies on the {111} plane because that is the most closely packed plane in FCC crystals and therefore the primary slip plane.

The two partial dislocations have Burgers vectors (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]. To find the plane they lie on, we need to identify a plane that is both a slip plane in the FCC structure and on which these Burgers vectors make sense.

The slip planes in an FCC crystal are the {111} planes. These include the (111), (-111), (1-11), (11-1), (-1-11), (-11-1), (1-1-1), and (-1-1-1) planes. The Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations should be parallel to their respective slip planes.

Let's check the options given:

(A) (-1 1 1)
(B) (1 1 1)
(C) (1 -1 1)
(D) (1 1 -1)

The Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations are (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]. These vectors are not directly parallel to the (1 1 1) plane, which eliminates option (B).

The vector (a/6)[2 -1 1] can be seen as a vector that lies in the plane defined by the vectors [1 0 0] and [0 1 1], which are perpendicular to the (-1 1 1) plane. Similarly, the vector (a/6)[1 -2 -1] can be seen as lying in the plane defined by the vectors [1 0 0] and [0 -1 1], which are perpendicular to the (1 -1 1) plane.

Since the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations are perpendicular to the (-1 1 1) and (1 -1 1) planes, respectively, and these planes are part of the {111} family of slip planes in an FCC crystal, the correct answer is that the two partial dislocations lie on the (-1 1 1) and (1 -1 1) planes.

However, since we need to choose one answer that applies to both partial dislocations, we should look for a common slip plane that both partial dislocations could lie on. Both (A) (-1 1 1) and (C) (1 -1 1) are part of the {111} family of planes, but they are not the same plane. The question seems to ask for a single plane that both partials would lie on after dissociation.

Given that the Burgers vectors of the partials are symmetric and the sum of the Burgers vectors equals the Burgers vector of the original perfect dislocation, which lies on the {111} plane, it is most likely that both partial dislocations would lie on the same {111} plane. Since the original perfect dislocation lies on the {111} plane, and the dissociation does not change the plane, both partials would remain on the same {111} plane.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Atomic structure,89,G-META-16-12,NUM,22,The lattice parameter of face-centered cubic iron (γ-Fe) is 0.3571 nm. The radius (in nm) of the octahedral void in γ-Fe is?," To find the radius of the octahedral void in a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice like γ-Fe, we can use the following relationship:

The radius of the octahedral void (r_void) is 0.414 times the radius of the atom (r_atom).

Since the lattice parameter (a) for γ-Fe is given as 0.3571 nm, we can calculate the radius of the iron atom using the relationship between the lattice parameter and the atomic radius for an fcc structure:

For fcc, the atomic radius (r_atom) is related to the lattice parameter (a) by the formula:
\[ r_{atom} = \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{4} \]

Let's calculate the atomic radius first:
\[ r_{atom} = \frac{0.3571 \text{ nm} \times \sqrt{2}}{4} \]
\[ r_{atom} = \frac{0.3571 \text{ nm} \times 1.414}{4} \]
\[ r_{atom} = \frac{0.5055 \text{ nm}}{4} \]
\[ r_{atom} = 0.1264 \text{ nm} \]

Now, we can find the radius of the octahedral void:
\[ r_{void} = 0.414 \times r_{atom} \]
\[ r_{void} = 0.414 \times 0.1264 \text{ nm} \]
\[ r_{void} = 0.0523 \text{ nm} \]

Therefore, the radius of the octahedral void in γ-Fe is approximately 0.0523 nm.

Atomic structure,90,G-META-17-19,NUM,40,Given: $λ_(CuKα)$ = 0.154 nm; lattice parameter of the metal = 0.36 nm. The second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC metal occurs at what Bragg angle θ (in degrees)? (answer up to two decimal places)," To find the Bragg angle (θ) for the second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal, we can use the Bragg's law, which is given by:

\[ n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

where:
- \( n \) is the order of the reflection (an integer),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the incident X-ray (0.154 nm for CuKα),
- \( d \) is the spacing between the planes in the crystal lattice,
- \( \theta \) is the Bragg angle.

For an FCC crystal, the spacing for the different planes can be calculated using the lattice parameter \( a \). The second peak typically corresponds to the (20) plane in an FCC lattice, and the spacing \( d \) for the (20) plane is given by:

\[ d_{20} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{a}{2} \]

Given the lattice parameter \( a = 0.36 \) nm, we have:

\[ d_{20} = \frac{0.36 \text{ nm}}{2} = 0.18 \text{ nm} \]

Now, we can use Bragg's law to solve for \( \theta \) for the second peak (where \( n = 1 \) since we are looking for the first-order reflection):

\[ \lambda = 2d_{20}\sin(\theta) \]
\[ 0.154 \text{ nm} = 2 \times 0.18 \text{ nm} \times \sin(\theta) \]
\[ \sin(\theta) = \frac{0.154 \text{ nm}}{2 \times 0.18 \text{ nm}} \]
\[ \sin(\theta) = \frac{0.154}{0.36} \]
\[ \sin(\theta) = 0.4277778 \]

Now we calculate the angle \( \theta \):

\[ \theta = \arcsin(0.4277778) \]

Converting to degrees (since most calculators use radians by default):

\[ \theta \approx \arcsin(0.4277778) \times \frac{180}{\pi} \]

Calculating this gives us:

\[ \theta \approx 25.25^\circ \]

So, the Bragg angle for the second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the FCC metal is approximately:

\[ \boxed{25.25^\circ} \]

The answer is: 25.25^\circ.",,,0,

Assertion [A]: Refractory BCC metals like W (tungsten) and Mo (molybdenum) are less ductile than FCC metals like Ni (nickel) and Pt (platinum) at room temperature.

This assertion is generally true. Refractory metals with a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure, such as tungsten and molybdenum, are known for their high melting points and hardness, but they are also typically less ductile than face-centered cubic (FCC) metals at room temperature. FCC metals, like nickel and platinum, tend to have better ductility due to their crystal structure, which allows for more slip systems to be activated at lower stresses.

Reason [R]: BCC metals have fewer independent slip systems than FCC metals.

This reason is also true. In crystal plasticity, the number of independent slip systems is crucial for the deformation of materials. FCC metals have 12 independent slip systems (4 <111> {111} slip systems and 8 <111> {111} twinning systems), which is more than the sufficient number of 5 to satisfy the von Mises criterion for plastic deformation without any constraint. In contrast, BCC metals typically have only 1 or 2 independent slip systems (<111> {110} or {112}<111>) at room temperature, which is below the required number to allow for ductile deformation in all directions without constraint. This limited number of slip systems in BCC metals contributes to their lower ductility compared to FCC metals.

Therefore, both the Assertion [A] and the Reason [R] are true, and the reason provided is indeed a correct explanation for the assertion.

The number of atoms per unit area($nm^(-2)$) in (100) plane of Pb is?(round off to the nearest integer)."," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure.

In an FCC unit cell, the atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice with atoms at each corner of the cube and at the center of each face. Each unit cell contains 4 atoms (since the corner atoms are shared by 8 unit cells and the face-centered atoms are shared by 2 unit cells).

The (100) plane in an FCC crystal is one of the close-packed planes, and it contains atoms in a square arrangement. The distance between adjacent atoms in this plane is equal to the atomic radius times 2 (since the atoms are touching each other).

Given the atomic radius (r) of Pb is 0.175 nm, the distance between adjacent atoms in the (100) plane is 2r = 2 * 0.175 nm = 0.350 nm.

To find the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane, we need to calculate the area of the unit cell in the (100) plane and then determine how many atoms are in that area.

The area (A) of the unit cell in the (100) plane is given by the square of the distance between adjacent atoms:

A = (2r)^2 = (0.350 nm)^2 = 0.1225 nm^2

Since there is one atom per unit area in the (100) plane of an FCC crystal, the number of atoms per unit area is simply the reciprocal of the area of the unit cell:

Number of atoms per unit area = 1 / A = 1 / 0.1225 nm^2 ≈ 8.16 nm^(-2)

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get:

Number of atoms per unit area ≈ 8 nm^(-2)

(A) 0.185 (B) 0.262 (C) 0.320 (D) 0.370"," To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg's law for X-ray diffraction, which is given by:

\[ n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta) \]

where:
- \( n \) is the order of the reflection (for the first peak, \( n = 1 \)),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the X-ray,
- \( d \) is the spacing between the planes in the crystal lattice,
- \( \theta \) is the Bragg angle.

For a FCC (face-centered cubic) crystal structure, the spacing \( d \) for the (111) planes, which are typically the first to diffract, is related to the lattice parameter \( a \) by the formula:

\[ d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Given that the first peak corresponds to the (111) planes, we can use the Bragg's law to find the lattice parameter \( a \).

First, we rearrange Bragg's law to solve for \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{n\lambda}{2\sin(\theta)} \]

Now we plug in the values:
- \( n = 1 \) (since we are looking at the first peak),
- \( \lambda = 0.1543 \) nm,
- \( \theta = 24.65^\circ \).

\[ d = \frac{1 \times 0.1543 \text{ nm}}{2\sin(24.65^\circ)} \]

Calculating the value of \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{0.1543 \text{ nm}}{2 \times \sin(24.65^\circ)} \]
\[ d \approx \frac{0.1543 \text{ nm}}{2 \times 0.4115} \]
\[ d \approx \frac{0.1543 \text{ nm}}{0.8230} \]
\[ d \approx 0.1874 \text{ nm} \]

Now we can find the lattice parameter \( a \) using the relationship for FCC:

\[ a = d_{111} \times \sqrt{3} \]
\[ a \approx 0.1874 \text{ nm} \times \sqrt{3} \]

Atomic structure,94,G-META-20-40,NUM,40,Assume hard sphere model and radius of Fe atom as 0.124 nm. Radius(in nm) of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice is?(round off to three decimal places)," To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the octahedral void in a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice and how it relates to the size of the iron (Fe) atoms.

In a BCC lattice, the octahedral voids are located in the center of the cube edges. The size of an octahedral void is determined by the positions of the surrounding atoms. For a BCC lattice, the octahedral void is surrounded by six atoms at the corners of an octahedron.

The radius of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void without distorting the lattice can be calculated by considering the geometry of the BCC structure. The void's size is such that an imaginary sphere (representing the interstitial atom) touching the six surrounding iron atoms will have a diameter equal to the edge of the cube minus twice the radius of the iron atom.

For a BCC lattice, the relationship between the atomic radius (r) and the lattice parameter (a, which is the length of the cube edge) is:

\[ a = \frac{4r}{\sqrt{3}} \]

The radius of the largest interstitial atom (R) that can fit into the octahedral void is:

\[ R = \frac{a}{2} - r \]

Substituting the expression for 'a' from the first equation into the second, we get:

\[ R = \frac{4r}{2\sqrt{3}} - r \]
\[ R = \frac{2r}{\sqrt{3}} - r \]
\[ R = r \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} - 1 \right) \]
\[ R = r \left( \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} \right) \]

Given that the radius of an iron atom (r) is 0.124 nm, we can now calculate the radius of the largest interstitial atom (R):

\[ R = 0.124 \left( \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} \right) \]
\[ R = 0.124 \left( \frac{2 - 1.732}{\sqrt{3}} \right) \]
\[ R = 0.124 \left( \frac{0.268}{\sqrt{3}} \right) \]
\[ R = 0.124 \left( \frac{0.268}{1.732} \right) \]
\[ R = 0.124 \times 0.1547 \]

Atomic structure,95,G-META-21-21,NUM,35,"In the X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC crystal, the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle (θ) of 30°. The Bragg angle(in degree) for the second reflection will be?(round off to 1 decimal places)"," To solve this problem, we can use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of incident X-rays to the spacing between crystal planes and the angle at which the X-rays are diffracted. Bragg's Law is given by:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where:
- n is the order of the reflection (an integer),
- λ is the wavelength of the incident X-rays,
- d is the spacing between the planes in the crystal, and
- θ is the Bragg angle.

For the first reflection (n=1), we have:

λ = 2d sin(θ₁)

Given that the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle (θ₁) of 30°, we can write:

λ = 2d sin(30°)
λ = 2d * (1/2)
λ = d

Now, for the second reflection (n=2), we want to find the Bragg angle (θ₂):

2λ = 2d sin(θ₂)

Substituting λ = d from the first reflection, we get:

2d = 2d sin(θ₂)
sin(θ₂) = 1

Since the sine of an angle cannot be greater than 1, this indicates that we have made a mistake in our assumption or calculation. The correct approach is to use the fact that for the second reflection, n=2:

2λ = 2d sin(θ₂)

Substituting λ = d from the first reflection, we get:

2d = 2d sin(θ₂)
sin(θ₂) = 2 * (1/2)
sin(θ₂) = 1

Again, we see that the sine of an angle cannot be 1 unless the angle is 90°, which is not physically possible for X-ray diffraction in a real crystal. This is because the maximum value of the Bragg angle is 90°, and the sine function has a maximum value of 1 at 90°. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem.

In a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal, the first reflection (n=1) corresponds to the (111) plane, and the second reflection (n=2) cannot correspond to the same set of planes because it would require an impossible Bragg angle. Instead, the second reflection typically corresponds to a different set of planes with a smaller interplanar spacing.

To find the Bragg angle for the second reflection, we need to know which set of planes is responsible for this reflection. In an FCC crystal, the likely candidate for the second reflection is the (200) plane, which has a smaller interplanar spacing than the (111) plane. The ratio of d-spacings for these planes in an FCC crystal is:

d(200) / d(111) = √3 / 2

Since the first reflection at 30° gives us λ = d(111), we can find the angle for the second reflection using the d-spacing for the (200) plane:

λ = 2 * d(200) * sin(θ₂)
d(111) = 2 * (d(111) * √3 / 2) * sin(θ₂)
1 = √3 * sin(θ₂)
sin(θ₂) = 1 / √3

Now we can calculate the Bragg angle for the second reflection:

θ₂ = sin⁻¹(1 / √3)

Calculating this gives us:

θ₂ ≈ 54.7°

Therefore, the Bragg angle for the second reflection, rounded to one decimal place, is:

Atomic structure,96,G-META-21-25,NUM,36,Given: R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$. The vacancy concentration in a crystal doubles upon increasing the temperature from 27°C to 127°C. The enthalpy (in KJ $mol^(-1)$) of vacancy formation is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ," To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the concentration of vacancies in a crystal as a function of temperature is given by the equation:

\[ C(T) = C_0 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T}\right) \]

where:
- \( C(T) \) is the concentration of vacancies at temperature \( T \),
- \( C_0 \) is a constant pre-exponential factor,
- \( \Delta H \) is the enthalpy of vacancy formation,
- \( R \) is the gas constant (given as 8.314 J \(mol^{-1}K^{-1}\)),
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

We are given that the vacancy concentration doubles when the temperature increases from 27°C to 127°C. Let's denote the initial concentration as \( C_1 \) and the final concentration as \( C_2 \), and the corresponding temperatures as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) in Kelvin.

\[ T_1 = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \text{ K} \]
\[ T_2 = 127 + 273.15 = 400.15 \text{ K} \]

Since the concentration doubles, we have:

\[ C_2 = 2 \cdot C_1 \]

Using the equation for vacancy concentration, we can write:

\[ C_1 = C_0 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T_1}\right) \]
\[ C_2 = C_0 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T_2}\right) \]

Now, we can set up the ratio of the two concentrations:

\[ \frac{C_2}{C_1} = \frac{C_0 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T_2}\right)}{C_0 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T_1}\right)} = 2 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T_2} + \frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T_1}\right) = 2 \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ -\frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T_2} + \frac{\Delta H}{R \cdot T_1} = \ln(2) \]

Now, we can solve for \( \Delta H \):

\[ \Delta H \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = R \cdot \ln(2) \]

The radius of an interstitial atom which just fits(without distorting the structure) inside an octahedral void of a bcc-iron crystal (in nm) is?(round off to 3 decimal places)," To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of an octahedral void in a body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure and how it relates to the radius of the atoms forming the crystal.

In a bcc crystal structure, an octahedral void is surrounded by six atoms, with the void located at the center of the cube formed by these atoms. The radius of the void is such that an atom of a certain size can fit into it without distorting the crystal structure.

The radius of the octahedral void in a bcc structure can be related to the radius of the atoms (R) forming the crystal by the following relationship:

Radius of octahedral void (r_void) = 0.414 * R

where R is the radius of the iron (Fe) atom in this case.

Given that the radius of an Fe atom (R) is 0.124 nm, we can calculate the radius of the octahedral void (r_void) as follows:

r_void = 0.414 * 0.124 nm

Now, let's do the calculation:

r_void = 0.414 * 0.124 nm ≈ 0.0513 nm

Atomic structure,99,G-META-22-50,NUM,38,Consider a tilt boundary of misorientation of 2° in an aluminium grain. The lattice parameter of aluminium is 0.143 nm. The spacing(in nm) between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ," To solve this problem, we can use the relationship between the misorientation angle (θ), the lattice parameter (a), and the spacing (D) between dislocations in a tilt boundary. The equation that relates these quantities is derived from the Frank formula and is given by:

\[ D = \frac{a}{2 \sin(\theta/2)} \]

where:
- \( D \) is the spacing between dislocations,
- \( a \) is the lattice parameter,
- \( \theta \) is the misorientation angle in radians.

Given:
- Misorientation angle (θ) = 2°, which we need to convert to radians since the sine function in the equation requires the angle to be in radians. The conversion is done using the fact that \( \pi \) radians = 180°.
- Lattice parameter (a) = 0.143 nm.

First, convert the angle from degrees to radians:
\[ \theta_{\text{radians}} = \theta_{\text{degrees}} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]
\[ \theta_{\text{radians}} = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]
\[ \theta_{\text{radians}} = \frac{\pi}{90} \]

Now, plug the values into the equation:
\[ D = \frac{0.143 \text{ nm}}{2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{90}/2)} \]
\[ D = \frac{0.143 \text{ nm}}{2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{180})} \]

Using a calculator to find the sine of \( \frac{\pi}{180} \) and then solving for D:
\[ D = \frac{0.143 \text{ nm}}{2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{180})} \]
\[ D \approx \frac{0.143 \text{ nm}}{2 \times 0.01745} \]
\[ D \approx \frac{0.143 \text{ nm}}{0.0349} \]
\[ D \approx 4.097 \text{ nm} \]

Rounding off to two decimal places:
\[ D \approx 4.10 \text{ nm} \]

First, let's calculate the elastic strain in the steel bar using the given load and the properties of steel.

Stress (σ) in the steel bar is given by:
\[ \sigma_{steel} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{20 \times 10^3 \text{ N}}{8 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2} = 25 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa} \]

Strain (ε) in the steel bar is given by:
\[ \varepsilon = \frac{\sigma}{E} \]

For the steel bar:
\[ \varepsilon_{steel} = \frac{\sigma_{steel}}{E_{steel}} = \frac{25 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}}{200 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}} = 1.25 \times 10^{-4} \]

Now, we are given that the aluminium bar experiences the same elastic strain when the same load is applied. Therefore, ε_aluminium = ε_steel.

Using the definition of strain and the Young's modulus for aluminium, we can find the stress in the aluminium bar:
\[ \varepsilon_{aluminium} = \frac{\sigma_{aluminium}}{E_{aluminium}} \]

\[ \sigma_{aluminium} = \varepsilon_{aluminium} \times E_{aluminium} \]

\[ \sigma_{aluminium} = 1.25 \times 10^{-4} \times 70 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa} \]

\[ \sigma_{aluminium} = 8.75 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa} \]

Now, we can find the required cross-sectional area for the aluminium bar using the stress and the given load:
\[ \sigma_{aluminium} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}_{aluminium}} \]

\[ \text{Area}_{aluminium} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\sigma_{aluminium}} \]

\[ \text{Area}_{aluminium} = \frac{20 \times 10^3 \text{ N}}{8.75 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}} \]

Here's how each property is affected:

(P) Young’s modulus - This is a measure of the stiffness of a material and is not significantly affected by dislocation density. It is related to the elastic behavior of the material, which is governed by the interatomic forces rather than dislocation movement.

(Q) Yield strength - The onset of plastic deformation, known as yielding, is directly influenced by the density of mobile dislocations. A higher density of dislocations can lead to a higher yield strength because more stress is required to move these dislocations through the material.

(R) Ductility - Ductility is the ability of a material to undergo significant plastic deformation before failure. A higher density of mobile dislocations typically enhances ductility because it allows for more slip systems to be active, facilitating plastic deformation.

(S) Fracture toughness - This property is a measure of a material's resistance to crack propagation.

If the Young’s moduli of Ti and SiC are 110 and 360 GPa respectively, the volume fraction of fibers in the composite is"," To solve for the volume fraction of fibers in the composite, we can use the rule of mixtures for composite materials. The rule of mixtures for Young's modulus in a unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite is given by:

\[ E_c = E_f V_f + E_m V_m \]

where:
- \( E_c \) is the Young's modulus of the composite,

- \( V_f \) is the volume fraction of the fibers,
- \( E_m \) is the Young's modulus of the matrix (Ti),
- \( V_m \) is the volume fraction of the matrix.

Since the volume fractions must sum up to 1 (i.e., \( V_f + V_m = 1 \)), we can express \( V_m \) as \( 1 - V_f \). Substituting this into the equation gives us:

\[ E_c = E_f V_f + E_m (1 - V_f) \]

Given:
- \( E_c = 185 \) GPa (Young's modulus of the composite),
- \( E_f = 360 \) GPa (Young's modulus of SiC fibers),
- \( E_m = 110 \) GPa (Young's modulus of Ti matrix).

We can now solve for \( V_f \):

\[ 185 = 360 V_f + 110 (1 - V_f) \]
\[ 185 = 360 V_f + 110 - 110 V_f \]
\[ 185 - 110 = 360 V_f - 110 V_f \]
\[ 75 = 250 V_f \]

When the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm, the expected yield strength(MPa) is ? "," To solve this problem, we can use the Hall-Petch relationship, which describes the relationship between the yield strength of a metal and the size of its grains. The Hall-Petch equation is given by:

\[ \sigma_y = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{\sqrt{d}} \]

where:
- \( \sigma_y \) is the yield strength,
- \( \sigma_0 \) is the friction stress (a material constant),
- \( k \) is the Hall-Petch slope (a material constant related to the resistance to dislocation motion), and
- \( d \) is the average grain diameter.

Given the yield strengths for two different grain sizes, we can set up a system of equations to solve for \( \sigma_0 \) and \( k \):

1. For \( d = 256 \) μm, \( \sigma_y = 120 \) MPa:
\[ 120 = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{\sqrt{256}} \]

2. For \( d = 64 \) μm, \( \sigma_y = 150 \) MPa:
\[ 150 = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{\sqrt{64}} \]

Now, let's solve these equations simultaneously. First, we simplify the square roots:

1. \( 120 = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{16} \)
2. \( 150 = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{8} \)

Next, we multiply each term by 16 to eliminate the fraction in the first equation:

1. \( 120 \times 16 = 16\sigma_0 + k \)
2. \( 150 \times 16 = 16\sigma_0 + 2k \)

Now we subtract the first new equation from the second to eliminate \( \sigma_0 \):

\[ (150 \times 16) - (120 \times 16) = (16\sigma_0 + 2k) - (16\sigma_0 + k) \]
\[ 300 \times 16 - 1920 = 2k - k \]
\[ 4800 - 1920 = k \]
\[ k = 2880 \]

Now that we have \( k \), we can solve for \( \sigma_0 \) using the first simplified equation:

\[ 120 = \sigma_0 + \frac{2880}{16} \]
\[ 120 = \sigma_0 + 180 \]
\[ \sigma_0 = 120 - 180 \]
\[ \sigma_0 = -60 \]

Now we have both constants, \( \sigma_0 \) and \( k \), and we can use them to find the yield strength when the grain size is 16 μm:

\[ \sigma_y = -60 + \frac{2880}{\sqrt{16}} \]
\[ \sigma_y = -60 + \frac{2880}{4} \]
\[ \sigma_y = -60 + 720 \]
\[ \sigma_y = 660 \]

Therefore, the expected yield strength when the grain size is reduced to 16 μm is 660 MPa. Here is the answer in a list as requested:

(A) Presence of dislocations - Dislocations are a type of defect that can affect the strength of materials, but they are more commonly associated with metals rather than ceramics. Ceramics typically have very few dislocations due to their ionic or covalent bonding, which makes dislocation movement difficult.

(C) Presence of voids - Voids are microscopic empty spaces within the material that can significantly weaken it by acting as stress risers. When stress is applied, these voids can lead to the initiation of cracks, which can then propagate and cause failure at much lower stress levels than the material's theoretical strength.

(A) Elastic deformation: This is a type of deformation where a material returns to its original shape once the applied stress is removed. It is instantaneous and reversible.

(B) Anelastic deformation: This type of deformation is also reversible, but the material does not return to its original shape immediately upon removal of the stress. It requires some time to recover.

- Anelastic deformation (B) is time-dependent because it involves a delayed recovery.

2. **Precipitate Growth and Transformation**: As ageing continues, these GP zones grow and can transform into more stable precipitates, such as θ'' (theta double prime), θ' (theta prime), and eventually the equilibrium phase θ (theta), which is CuAl2.

3. **Hardness Peak**: The hardness of the alloy increases as the GP zones and subsequent precipitates form and grow because they impede dislocation motion. However, there is a point where the hardness reaches a peak. This peak corresponds to the optimum balance between the number of precipitates and their size.

4. **Over-ageing**: Beyond this peak, further ageing leads to a decrease in hardness. This is because the precipitates grow larger and become less effective at hindering dislocation motion. Additionally, the precipitates may lose coherency with the matrix, which also reduces their strengthening effect.

Given this sequence, the correct answer to the question is:

(C) first increases and then decreases

The hardness of the alloy increases as GP zones and metastable precipitates form and then decreases as the alloy becomes over-aged and the precipitates coarsen.

Mechanical,13,G-XEC-2013-21,NUM,44,"A stress of 10 MPa is applied to an elastomer to generate a strain of 50%. The strain is held constant at this value. After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What is the relaxation time constant for this material?"," To determine the relaxation time constant for the material, we can use the concept of stress relaxation in polymers and elastomers. Stress relaxation is the time-dependent decrease in stress at constant strain. The relaxation process can often be described by an exponential decay function:

\[ \sigma(t) = \sigma_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau} \]

where:
- \( \sigma(t) \) is the stress at time \( t \),
- \( \sigma_0 \) is the initial stress,
- \( t \) is the time, and
- \( \tau \) is the relaxation time constant.

Given that the initial stress \( \sigma_0 \) is 10 MPa and after 40 days (which is \( t \)) the stress \( \sigma(t) \) decreases to 5 MPa, we can rearrange the equation to solve for \( \tau \):

\[ 5 \text{ MPa} = 10 \text{ MPa} \cdot e^{-40 \text{ days}/\tau} \]

\[ \frac{1}{2} = e^{-40 \text{ days}/\tau} \]

\[ \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{40 \text{ days}}{\tau} \]

\[ -\ln(2) = -\frac{40 \text{ days}}{\tau} \]

\[ \tau = \frac{40 \text{ days}}{\ln(2)} \]

Now, we can calculate the relaxation time constant \( \tau \):

\[ \tau = \frac{40}{\ln(2)} \]

\[ \tau \approx \frac{40}{0.693} \]

\[ \tau \approx 57.7 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the relaxation time constant for this material is approximately 57.7 days.

Mechanical,14,G-XEC-2013-22,NUM,45,"A stress of 10 MPa is applied to an elastomer to generate a strain of 50%. The strain is held constant at this value. After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What will be the stress after 60 days at 20°C?"," The phenomenon described in the question is known as stress relaxation in an elastomer. Stress relaxation is the time-dependent decrease in stress in a material that is subjected to a constant strain. This behavior is particularly pronounced in elastomers and polymers due to their viscoelastic nature.

Given that the stress decreases from 10 MPa to 5 MPa over 40 days while maintaining a constant strain of 50%, we can infer that the material is exhibiting significant stress relaxation. However, predicting the exact stress value after 60 days based solely on the information provided is not straightforward because stress relaxation data typically follows a non-linear decay curve, which can be material-dependent and often requires empirical models to predict.

In the absence of a specific stress relaxation model or additional data for the material in question, we can attempt a simple linear extrapolation as a rough estimate. However, this method does not account for the non-linear nature of stress relaxation and should be taken with caution.

Using a linear approximation, we can calculate the rate of stress decrease per day:

Stress decrease per day = (Initial stress - Final stress) / Number of days
Stress decrease per day = (10 MPa - 5 MPa) / 40 days
Stress decrease per day = 5 MPa / 40 days
Stress decrease per day = 0.125 MPa/day

Now, we can estimate the stress after 60 days by subtracting the stress decrease over the additional 20 days from the stress at 40 days:

Stress after 60 days = Stress at 40 days - (Stress decrease per day * Additional days)
Stress after 60 days = 5 MPa - (0.125 MPa/day * 20 days)
Stress after 60 days = 5 MPa - 2.5 MPa
Stress after 60 days = 2.5 MPa

Therefore, using a simple linear extrapolation, the estimated stress after 60 days at 20°C would be:

Answer:
- 2.5 MPa

Please note that this is a rough estimate and the actual stress value could be different due to the non-linear nature of stress relaxation in elastomers. For a more accurate prediction, a stress relaxation master curve or a time-temperature superposition principle would typically be used, which requires extensive experimental data for the specific material.",,,0,
Mechanical,15,G-XEC-2014-11,NUM,53,A bar of Ti with Young’s modulus of 110 GPa and yield strength of 880 MPa is tested in tension. It is noticed that the alloy does not exhibit any strain hardening and fails at a total strain of 0.108. The mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material in MJ/$m^3$ is," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mechanical energy required to break the material. This energy is represented by the area under the stress-strain curve up to the point of failure. Since the material does not exhibit any strain hardening, we can assume that the stress-strain relationship is linear up to the yield point, and then the stress remains constant (ideal plastic behavior) until failure.

Here are the steps to calculate the mechanical energy:

1. Calculate the stress at yielding in Pa (since 1 MPa = 10^6 Pa):
   Yield stress, σ_y = 880 MPa = 880 * 10^6 Pa

2. Convert the total strain at failure to a decimal:
   Total strain at failure, ε_f = 0.108

3. Calculate the elastic strain, which is the strain up to the yield point. This is done by dividing the yield stress by the Young's modulus (Hooke's Law):
   Elastic strain, ε_y = σ_y / E
   where E is the Young's modulus in Pa (1 GPa = 10^9 Pa):
   E = 110 GPa = 110 * 10^9 Pa

4. Calculate the elastic strain energy density (up to the yield point), which is given by the area of a triangle with base as the elastic strain and height as the yield stress:
   Elastic energy density, U_elastic = 0.5 * σ_y * ε_y

5. Calculate the plastic strain energy density (from yield point to failure), which is given by the area of a rectangle with height as the yield stress and width as the plastic strain (total strain at failure minus elastic strain):
   Plastic strain, ε_p = ε_f - ε_y
   Plastic energy density, U_plastic = σ_y * ε_p

6. The total mechanical energy density required to break the material is the sum of the elastic and plastic energy densities:
   Total energy density, U_total = U_elastic + U_plastic

Now, let's perform the calculations:

1. σ_y = 880 * 10^6 Pa

2. ε_f = 0.108

3. ε_y = σ_y / E = (880 * 10^6 Pa) / (110 * 10^9 Pa) = 0.008

4. U_elastic = 0.5 * σ_y * ε_y = 0.5 * (880 * 10^6 Pa) * (0.008) = 3.52 * 10^6 J/m^3

5. ε_p = ε_f - ε_y = 0.108 - 0.008 = 0.100
   U_plastic = σ_y * ε_p = (880 * 10^6 Pa) * (0.100) = 88 * 10^6 J/m^3

6. U_total = U_elastic + U_plastic = (3.52 * 10^6 J/m^3) + (88 * 10^6 J/m^3) = 91.52 * 10^6 J/m^3

To express the total energy density in MJ/m^3, we divide by 10^6 (since 1 MJ = 10^6 J):

U_total = 91.52 MJ/m^3

The final answer is:

Mechanical,17,G-XEC-2017-18,NUM,35,A ceramic material with a critical flaw size of 30 μm has fracture stress of 300 MPa. For the same material the fracture stress(in Mpa) for a critical flaw size of 90 μm will be?," To solve this problem, we can use the principles of fracture mechanics, specifically the relationship described by the Griffith equation for the fracture stress (σ) of a brittle material with a flaw of size (a):

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma}{\pi a}} \]

where:
- \( E \) is the Young's modulus of the material,
- \( \gamma \) is the surface energy density, and
- \( a \) is the crack length or flaw size.

For a given material, \( E \) and \( \gamma \) are constants. Therefore, the fracture stress is inversely proportional to the square root of the flaw size:

\[ \sigma \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \]

Given that the initial fracture stress (\( \sigma_1 \)) is 300 MPa for a critical flaw size (\( a_1 \)) of 30 μm, we can write:

\[ \sigma_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma}{\pi a_1}} \]

For a new flaw size (\( a_2 \)) of 90 μm, we want to find the new fracture stress (\( \sigma_2 \)):

\[ \sigma_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma}{\pi a_2}} \]

Dividing the two equations, we get:

\[ \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} = \sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \frac{\sigma_2}{300 \text{ MPa}} = \sqrt{\frac{30 \text{ μm}}{90 \text{ μm}}} \]

\[ \frac{\sigma_2}{300 \text{ MPa}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} \]

\[ \sigma_2 = 300 \text{ MPa} \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} \]

\[ \sigma_2 = 300 \text{ MPa} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \]

\[ \sigma_2 = 300 \text{ MPa} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} \]

\[ \sigma_2 = 300 \text{ MPa} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \]

\[ \sigma_2 = \frac{300 \text{ MPa} \times \sqrt{3}}{3} \]

Now, we can calculate the numerical value:

\[ \sigma_2 = \frac{300 \times 1.732}{3} \]

\[ \sigma_2 = \frac{519.6}{3} \]

\[ \sigma_2 = 173.2 \text{ MPa} \]

Therefore, the fracture stress for a critical flaw size of 90 μm is 173.2 MPa.

For the same alloy, when engineering strain is 0.12 then the engineering stress(in MPa) is? (round off to the nearest integer)"," To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between true stress and true strain, as well as the relationship between true stress/strain and engineering stress/strain.

Given the equation for true stress (σ) as a function of true strain (ε) in the plastic region:

\[ \sigma = 600 \epsilon^n \]

We are told that when the true strain (ε) is 0.05, the true stress (σ) is 350 MPa. We can use this information to find the value of n:

\[ 350 = 600 \times (0.05)^n \]
\[ \frac{350}{600} = (0.05)^n \]
\[ \frac{7}{12} = (0.05)^n \]
\[ n = \frac{\log(\frac{7}{12})}{\log(0.05)} \]

Now, let's calculate n:

\[ n = \frac{\log(\frac{7}{12})}{\log(0.05)} \approx \frac{\log(0.5833)}{\log(0.05)} \approx \frac{-0.2340}{-1.3979} \approx 0.1674 \]

Now that we have the value of n, we can use it to find the true stress when the engineering strain is 0.12. However, we need to convert the engineering strain to true strain. The relationship between engineering strain (ε_eng) and true strain (ε) in the plastic region is given by:

\[ \varepsilon = \ln(1 + \varepsilon_{eng}) \]

So for an engineering strain of 0.12:

\[ \varepsilon = \ln(1 + 0.12) \]
\[ \varepsilon = \ln(1.12) \]
\[ \varepsilon \approx 0.1133 \]

Now we can find the true stress (σ) using the value of n we calculated:

\[ \sigma = 600 \times (0.1133)^{0.1674} \]
\[ \sigma \approx 600 \times (1.1197) \] (using a calculator)
\[ \sigma \approx 671.8 \]

This true stress needs to be converted to engineering stress (σ_eng). The relationship between true stress and engineering stress in the plastic region is given by:

\[ \sigma_{eng} = \sigma \times (1 + \varepsilon_{eng}) \]

So the engineering stress when the engineering strain is 0.12 is:

\[ \sigma_{eng} = 671.8 \times (1 + 0.12) \]
\[ \sigma_{eng} = 671.8 \times 1.12 \]
\[ \sigma_{eng} \approx 752.576 \]

Rounding off to the nearest integer:

\[ \sigma_{eng} \approx 753 \text{ MPa} \]

Therefore, the engineering stress when the engineering strain is 0.12 is approximately 753 MPa. Here is the answer in a list as requested:

Mechanical,19,G-XEC-2019-21,NUM,32,A piezoelectric material has a Young’s modulus of 72 GPa. The stress(in MPa) required to change the polarization from 640 to 645 C m $m^(-3)$ is. (round off to the nearest integer)," To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between stress and polarization in piezoelectric materials. The change in polarization with respect to stress is characterized by the piezoelectric coefficients. However, the question does not provide the relevant piezoelectric coefficient directly. Instead, it seems to imply a direct linear relationship between stress and polarization, which is a simplification.

In a linear elastic material, the relationship between stress (σ) and strain (ε) is given by Hooke's Law:

σ = E * ε

where E is Young's modulus.

However, for piezoelectric materials, the relationship between stress and polarization (P) is not as straightforward, as it involves the piezoelectric coefficients (d_ij or e_ij, depending on the notation) and the electric field (E). The relevant equation for the direct piezoelectric effect is:

P_i = d_ij * σ_j + ε_0 * ε_r * E_i

where:
- P_i is the polarization in the i-th direction,
- d_ij is the piezoelectric strain coefficient,
- σ_j is the stress in the j-th direction,
- ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity,
- ε_r is the relative permittivity of the material,
- E_i is the electric field in the i-th direction.

Since we are looking for the stress required to change the polarization, we would need to rearrange the equation to solve for σ_j:

σ_j = (P_i - ε_0 * ε_r * E_i) / d_ij

However, we do not have the values for d_ij, ε_0, ε_r, or E_i. Without these values, we cannot calculate the exact stress required for the given change in polarization.

Given the lack of information, we can only assume that the change in polarization is directly proportional to the stress applied, which is a significant simplification and not generally accurate for piezoelectric materials. If we were to make this assumption, we could say:

ΔP = k * Δσ

where:
- ΔP is the change in polarization,
- k is a proportionality constant (which would be related to the piezoelectric coefficients and material properties),
- Δσ is the change in stress.

Given that ΔP = 645 C m⁻³ - 640 C m⁻³ = 5 C m⁻³, we would need to know the value of k to find Δσ. Since we do not have this information, we cannot provide a numerical answer to the question.

To proceed, we would need additional information about the piezoelectric coefficients of the material or a direct relationship between the change in polarization and the stress required. Without this information, the question cannot be answered accurately.

(A) Young’s modulus of A is greater than B (B) Yield strength of A is greater than B (C) Scratch resistance of A is greater than B (D) Ductility of A is greater than B," The Vickers microhardness test measures the hardness of a material, which is generally defined as the resistance to permanent deformation. When a material has a higher Vickers hardness (HV) value, it indicates that the material is harder. Here's how the higher hardness of material A compared to material B might relate to the other properties listed:

(A) Young’s modulus of A is greater than B:
- Hardness and Young's modulus are related but not directly proportional. Young's modulus measures the stiffness of a material, which is the ability to resist elastic deformation under stress. A harder material is not necessarily stiffer, so this statement is not necessarily true based on hardness alone.

(B) Yield strength of A is greater than B:
- Yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. Generally, a higher hardness correlates with a higher yield strength because a harder material can resist plastic deformation better. Therefore, it is likely that the yield strength of A is greater than that of B.

(C) Scratch resistance of A is greater than B:
- Scratch resistance is directly related to hardness. A harder material will typically resist scratching better than a softer material. Therefore, it is true that the scratch resistance of A is greater than that of B.

(D) Ductility of A is greater than B:
- Ductility is the ability of a material to undergo significant plastic deformation before rupture. In ductile materials, a higher hardness often comes at the expense of ductility. This means that material A, which is harder, may actually be less ductile than material B. Therefore, this statement is likely not true.

Based on the above analysis, the true statements are:

- (B) Yield strength of A is greater than B

Under the iso-stress condition, the stress in the matrix and the fibers is the same when the composite is loaded in the direction perpendicular to the fibers.

The Young's modulus of the composite $E_C$ can be determined by considering the total strain in the composite, which is the sum of the strains in the matrix and the fibers, weighted by their respective volume fractions. Since the stress is the same in both the matrix and the fibers, we can write:

\[ \epsilon_C = \epsilon_m = \epsilon_f \]

where $\epsilon_C$, $\epsilon_m$, and $\epsilon_f$ are the strains in the composite, matrix, and fibers, respectively.

Using Hooke's Law, which states that stress is equal to the product of Young's modulus and strain ($\sigma = E \epsilon$), we can express the strain in terms of stress and Young's modulus:

\[ \frac{\sigma}{E_C} = \frac{\sigma}{E_m} = \frac{\sigma}{E_f} \]

Since the stress $\sigma$ is the same in both the matrix and the fibers, we can write the strain in the composite as a weighted average of the strains in the matrix and the fibers:

\[ \frac{1}{E_C} = \frac{f}{E_f} + \frac{1-f}{E_m} \]

This is the rule of mixtures for the elastic modulus of a composite under iso-stress conditions in the direction perpendicular to the fibers.

- Q. Creep: The permanent deformation of a material over time under constant stress or strain, often at high temperatures.
- R. Strain hardening: The process by which a material becomes stronger and harder as it is plastically deformed.
- S. Yield point phenomenon: The point on a stress-strain curve where the material's behavior changes from elastic to plastic, often associated with a drop in stress.

- 2. Slip band extrusion and intrusion: The formation of extrusions and intrusions on the surface of a material due to the movement of dislocations, often associated with fatigue.
- 3. Cottrell atmosphere: The formation of an atmosphere of solute atoms around dislocations, which can impede their movement and contribute to strain hardening.
- 4. Dislocation interaction: The interaction between dislocations, which can lead to strain hardening as dislocations tangle and impede each other's movement.

Now, let's match the phenomena with the mechanisms:

- P. Fatigue is associated with the formation of slip bands, which can lead to extrusions and intrusions on the material's surface. Therefore, P matches with 2.
- Q. Creep is often a result of grain boundary sliding, especially at high temperatures where the material's grains can slide past each other more easily. Therefore, Q matches with 1.
- R. Strain hardening occurs as dislocations interact and become entangled, making it harder for them to move. This is described by 4. Dislocation interaction. Therefore, R matches with 4.
- S. Yield point phenomenon is associated with the breakaway of dislocations from solute atoms, which have been pinning them. This is described by the Cottrell atmosphere mechanism. Therefore, S matches with 3.

Fracture stress for the same material having a crack length of 4 µm is  (A) 200 MPa (B) 150 MPa (C) 100 MPa (D) 50 MPa," To solve this problem, we can use the principles of fracture mechanics, specifically the relationship between fracture stress (σ) and crack length (a) for a brittle material, which is often described by the Griffith equation for the critical stress intensity factor (K_Ic):

\[ K_{Ic} = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a} \]

where:
- \( K_{Ic} \) is the critical stress intensity factor (a material property for a given thickness and temperature),
- \( \sigma \) is the applied stress,
- \( a \) is the crack length.

For a given material, \( K_{Ic} \) is a constant. Therefore, if we know the fracture stress for one crack length, we can find the fracture stress for another crack length by rearranging the equation and solving for \( \sigma \):

\[ \sigma = \frac{K_{Ic}}{\sqrt{\pi a}} \]

Given that the fracture stress for a crack length of 1 µm (a_1) is 200 MPa, we can write:

\[ K_{Ic} = 200 \text{ MPa} \sqrt{\pi \times 1 \text{ µm}} \]

Now, we want to find the fracture stress (σ_2) for a crack length of 4 µm (a_2):

\[ \sigma_2 = \frac{K_{Ic}}{\sqrt{\pi \times 4 \text{ µm}}} \]

Since \( K_{Ic} \) is constant for the material, we can substitute the expression for \( K_{Ic} \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ \sigma_2 = \frac{200 \text{ MPa} \sqrt{\pi \times 1 \text{ µm}}}{\sqrt{\pi \times 4 \text{ µm}}} \]

Simplifying this expression by canceling out \( \sqrt{\pi} \) and taking the square root of the ratio of the crack lengths:

\[ \sigma_2 = 200 \text{ MPa} \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} \]

Mechanical,25,G-META-12-45,MCQS-NUM,54,"The flow stress (σ) of an alloy varies with strain rate (ε) as σ = 100* $(ε)^(0.1)$ MPa. When the alloy is hot extruded from 10 cm diameter to 5 cm diameter at a speed of 2 cm/s, the flow stress is  (A) 1000 MPa (B) 105 MPa (C) 150 MPa (D) 1050 MPa"," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the flow stress (σ) of the alloy during the hot extrusion process using the given relationship between flow stress and strain rate:

σ = 100 * $(ε)^(0.1)$ MPa

First, we need to determine the strain rate (ε) during the extrusion process. The strain rate is defined as the rate of change of strain with respect to time. However, the question does not provide the strain directly, but rather the change in diameter of the alloy during extrusion. We can relate the strain to the change in diameter by considering the volume constancy during plastic deformation (assuming the extrusion process is isochoric).

The initial cross-sectional area (A_i) of the alloy is:

A_i = π * (5 cm)^2 = π * 25 cm^2

The final cross-sectional area (A_f) after extrusion is:

A_f = π * (2.5 cm)^2 = π * 6.25 cm^2

Since the volume remains constant:

A_i * v_i = A_f * v_f

where v_i and v_f are the initial and final velocities, respectively. We are given the initial velocity (v_i) as 2 cm/s, and we can assume that the final velocity (v_f) is the speed at which the alloy exits the die, which we need to calculate.

v_f = (A_i / A_f) * v_i
v_f = (25 cm^2 / 6.25 cm^2) * 2 cm/s
v_f = 5 * 2 cm/s
v_f = 10 cm/s

Now, we can calculate the strain rate (ε) as the change in velocity per unit length:

ε = (v_f - v_i) / L

where L is the length over which the velocity change occurs. However, we do not have the length L provided in the question. Without this information, we cannot directly calculate the strain rate. Since we cannot determine the strain rate, we cannot directly calculate the flow stress using the given formula.

Given that we cannot calculate the strain rate, we need to look at the question differently. The question provides a relationship between flow stress and strain rate, but it does not give us enough information to calculate the strain rate during the extrusion process. Therefore, we might need to consider if there is any additional information or assumptions we can make to answer the question.

Since the question is multiple-choice and we have a relationship between flow stress and strain rate, we can try to infer the strain rate from the given options. The relationship σ = 100 * $(ε)^(0.1)$ suggests that the flow stress increases with the strain rate but at a decreasing rate due to the exponent being less than 1.

Let's analyze the options given:

(A) 1000 MPa
(B) 105 MPa
(C) 150 MPa
(D) 1050 MPa

If we assume that the strain rate during extrusion is significant (which is a reasonable assumption for a hot extrusion process), we would expect the flow stress to be higher than the base value of 100 MPa (which would be the flow stress at a strain rate of 1, since $1^(0.1) = 1$).

Options (A) and (D) are significantly higher than the base value, which might suggest a very high strain rate. Option (C) is only 50 MPa above the base value, which seems low for an extrusion process. Option (B) is a modest increase above the base value, which could correspond to a moderate strain rate.

Without the ability to calculate the exact strain rate, we cannot definitively choose the correct option based on the given information. However, if we were to make an educated guess based on typical strain rates experienced during hot extrusion processes, we might eliminate the extreme values (A) and (D) as being too high without additional information to support such high flow stresses. Between options (B) and (C), option (B) seems more reasonable for a typical extrusion process.

Therefore, based on an educated guess and the given relationship, the most likely answer is:

Mechanical,26,G-META-12-53,MCQS-NUM,42,A material with grain size of ASTM No. 6 has a lattice frictional stress 100 MN/$m^2$ and locking parameter (Hall-Petch constant) 0.10 MN/$m^(1.5)$. Yield strength of the material is approximately  (A) 100 MPa (B) 115 MPa (C) 165 MPa (D) 215 MPa," To solve this question, we can use the Hall-Petch equation, which relates the yield strength of a material to its grain size:

\[ \sigma_y = \sigma_0 + k \cdot d^{-1/2} \]

where:
- \( \sigma_y \) is the yield strength,
- \( \sigma_0 \) is the lattice frictional stress (also known as the friction stress),
- \( k \) is the Hall-Petch constant (also known as the locking parameter),
- \( d \) is the average grain diameter.

The ASTM grain size number is a logarithmic scale that relates to the number of grains per square inch at a magnification of 100x. The relationship between ASTM grain size number \( G \) and the number of grains per square inch \( N \) is given by:

\[ N = 2^{(G-1)} \]

For ASTM No. 6 grain size, we can calculate the number of grains per square inch:

\[ N = 2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32 \]

To find the average grain diameter \( d \), we can use the inverse relationship:

\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}} \]

Since there are 32 grains per square inch, the area per grain is \( \frac{1}{32} \) square inches. Converting this to square meters (since the Hall-Petch constant is given in units of \( MN/m^{1.5} \)):

\[ 1 \text{ inch} = 0.0254 \text{ meters} \]
\[ 1 \text{ square inch} = (0.0254)^2 \text{ square meters} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{32} \cdot (0.0254)^2} \text{ meters} \]

Now, let's calculate \( d \):

\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{32} \cdot (0.0254)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{(0.0254)^2}{32}} \]
\[ d = \frac{0.0254}{\sqrt{32}} \]
\[ d = \frac{0.0254}{\sqrt{2^5}} \]
\[ d = \frac{0.0254}{2^{5/2}} \]
\[ d = \frac{0.0254}{2^{2.5}} \]
\[ d = \frac{0.0254}{5.65685} \]
\[ d \approx 0.00449 \text{ meters} \]

Now we have all the necessary values to calculate the yield strength \( \sigma_y \):

\[ \sigma_y = \sigma_0 + k \cdot d^{-1/2} \]
\[ \sigma_y = 100 \text{ MN}/m^2 + 0.10 \text{ MN}/m^{1.5} \cdot (0.00449 \text{ m})^{-1/2} \]
\[ \sigma_y = 100 \text{ MPa} + 0.10 \text{ MPa} \cdot m^{1/2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.00449 \text{ m}}} \]
\[ \sigma_y = 100 \text{ MPa} + 0.10 \text{ MPa} \cdot m^{1/2} \cdot \frac{1}{0.0670 \text{ m}^{1/2}} \]
\[ \sigma_y = 100 \text{ MPa} + 0.10 \text{ MPa} \cdot \frac{1}{0.0670} \]
\[ \sigma_y = 100 \text{ MPa} + 1.49253731 \text{ MPa} \]
\[ \sigma_y \approx 101.49253731 \text{ MPa} \]

Mechanical,27,G-META-13-9,MCQS,41,"As compared to the engineering stress-engineering strain curve, the true stress-true strain curve for a given material  (A) lies above and to the left (B) lies below and to the right (C) crosses the engineering stress-engineering strain curve (D) is identical "," The correct answer is:

(C) crosses the engineering stress-engineering strain curve

Explanation:
The true stress-true strain curve for a given material typically crosses the engineering stress-engineering strain curve. This is because the engineering stress and strain are calculated based on the original dimensions of the material, while the true stress and true strain account for the changes in dimensions as the material deforms.

Initially, the true stress is lower than the engineering stress because the actual cross-sectional area over which the force is applied increases as the material necks down. This causes the true stress to be less than the engineering stress, which is based on the original cross-sectional area.

As deformation continues, the true stress increases more rapidly than the engineering stress because the cross-sectional area continues to decrease. Eventually, the true stress curve will cross the engineering stress curve. After this point, the true stress will be higher than the engineering stress, and the true strain will be higher than the engineering strain.

Therefore, the true stress-true strain curve starts below the engineering stress-engineering strain curve, crosses it at some point, and then lies above it as the material undergoes plastic deformation and necking.

Mechanical,28,G-META-13-33,MCQS-NUM,49,The yield strength of a polycrystalline metal increases from 100 MPa to 145 MPa on decreasing the grain size from 64 µm to 25 µm. The yield strength of this metal (in MPa) having a grain size of 36 µm is  (A) 110 (B) 125 (C) 140 (D) 165," To solve this problem, we can use the Hall-Petch relationship, which describes the relationship between the yield strength of a metal and the grain size. The Hall-Petch equation is given by:

\[ \sigma_y = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{\sqrt{d}} \]

where:
- \(\sigma_y\) is the yield strength,
- \(\sigma_0\) is the friction stress (the yield strength of a single crystal),
- \(k\) is the Hall-Petch slope (a material constant),
- \(d\) is the average grain diameter.

We are given two data points for yield strength and grain size:
1. When \(d_1 = 64 \, µm\), \(\sigma_{y1} = 100 \, MPa\).
2. When \(d_2 = 25 \, µm\), \(\sigma_{y2} = 145 \, MPa\).

We can use these two points to solve for \(\sigma_0\) and \(k\):

\[ 100 = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{\sqrt{64}} \]
\[ 145 = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{\sqrt{25}} \]

Let's solve these equations simultaneously. First, we'll rewrite the equations as:

\[ 100 = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{8} \]
\[ 145 = \sigma_0 + \frac{k}{5} \]

Now, let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(\sigma_0\):

\[ 145 - 100 = \left(\frac{k}{5} - \frac{k}{8}\right) \]
\[ 45 = \frac{8k - 5k}{40} \]
\[ 45 = \frac{3k}{40} \]
\[ k = \frac{45 \times 40}{3} \]
\[ k = 600 \]

Now that we have \(k\), we can solve for \(\sigma_0\) using the first equation:

\[ 100 = \sigma_0 + \frac{600}{8} \]
\[ 100 = \sigma_0 + 75 \]
\[ \sigma_0 = 100 - 75 \]
\[ \sigma_0 = 25 \]

Now we have both constants:

\[ \sigma_0 = 25 \, MPa \]
\[ k = 600 \, MPa\sqrt{\mu m} \]

We can now find the yield strength for a grain size of \(36 \, µm\):

\[ \sigma_y = 25 + \frac{600}{\sqrt{36}} \]
\[ \sigma_y = 25 + \frac{600}{6} \]
\[ \sigma_y = 25 + 100 \]
\[ \sigma_y = 125 \, MPa \]

The correct answer is (B) 125.

Mechanical,30,G-META-14-9,NUM,36,A tensile specimen was deformed at a constant crosshead speed of 6 mm/min. The strain rate at the start of the testing was 5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$. The initial gauge length of the specimen (in mm) was?," To solve for the initial gauge length of the specimen, we can use the definition of strain rate and rearrange it to solve for the initial gauge length (L₀).

The strain rate (\(\dot{\epsilon}\)) is defined as the rate of change of strain with respect to time. Mathematically, it is given by:

\[\dot{\epsilon} = \frac{d\epsilon}{dt}\]

Where:
- \(\dot{\epsilon}\) is the strain rate,
- \(d\epsilon\) is the change in strain,
- \(dt\) is the change in time.

For a tensile test, the strain (\(\epsilon\)) is also given by:

\[\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}\]

Where:
- \(\Delta L\) is the change in length,
- \(L_0\) is the initial gauge length.

Since the strain rate is constant, we can say:

\[\dot{\epsilon} = \frac{1}{L_0} \cdot \frac{dL}{dt}\]

We are given that the strain rate (\(\dot{\epsilon}\)) is \(5 \times 10^{-3} s^{-1}\) and the crosshead speed (\(dL/dt\)) is 6 mm/min. We need to convert the crosshead speed from mm/min to mm/s to match the units of the strain rate:

\[6 \frac{mm}{min} \cdot \frac{1 min}{60 s} = 0.1 \frac{mm}{s}\]

Now we can solve for \(L_0\):

\[5 \times 10^{-3} s^{-1} = \frac{1}{L_0} \cdot 0.1 \frac{mm}{s}\]

\[L_0 = \frac{0.1 \frac{mm}{s}}{5 \times 10^{-3} s^{-1}}\]

\[L_0 = \frac{0.1}{5 \times 10^{-3}}\]

\[L_0 = 20 \frac{mm}{s^1}\]

\[L_0 = 20 mm\]

So the initial gauge length of the specimen is 20 mm.

What is the stress amplitude, in MPa?"," To find the stress amplitude of a fluctuating stress cycle, we need to determine the peak-to-peak variation in stress and then divide it by 2. The stress cycle varies from a maximum tension of 400 MPa to a minimum compression of -300 MPa (since compression is typically considered negative stress).

The peak-to-peak stress range is the difference between the maximum and minimum stress values:

Peak-to-peak stress range = Maximum stress - Minimum stress
Peak-to-peak stress range = 400 MPa - (-300 MPa)
Peak-to-peak stress range = 400 MPa + 300 MPa
Peak-to-peak stress range = 700 MPa

Now, to find the stress amplitude, we divide this peak-to-peak range by 2:

Stress amplitude = Peak-to-peak stress range / 2
Stress amplitude = 700 MPa / 2
Stress amplitude = 350 MPa

Therefore, the stress amplitude of the fluctuating stress cycle is 350 MPa.

(A) As the average grain size increases, the grain boundary energy per unit area decreases.
- This statement is correct. Larger grains have less total grain boundary area per unit volume, which means lower grain boundary energy per unit area.

(B) The driving force for grain growth is the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material.
- This statement is correct. Grain growth is driven by the reduction in total grain boundary energy, which is a function of the total boundary area per unit volume. As grains grow and the boundary area decreases, the energy of the system is reduced.

(C) Higher the temperature, the faster is the grain growth.
- This statement is generally correct. Higher temperatures increase atomic mobility, which allows for faster grain boundary movement and thus faster grain growth.

(D) Impurity atoms segregated at grain boundaries can retard grain growth.
- This statement is correct. Impurities can pin grain boundaries and prevent them from moving, thus slowing down or even stopping grain growth.

Based on the analysis above, all the statements (A), (B), (C), and (D) are correct with respect to grain growth. Since the question asks for the incorrect statement and all the given statements are correct, there seems to be a mistake in the question as presented.

However, if we must choose the statement that could be considered incorrect under certain conditions, it would be:

(C) Higher the temperature, the faster is the grain growth.
- While this statement is generally true, there are cases where abnormally high temperatures can lead to exaggerated grain growth or other microstructural instabilities, which might not always be desirable or might not always lead to a faster rate of grain growth in the conventional sense. Additionally, at very high temperatures, the material might start to melt or undergo other phase transformations that could complicate the grain growth process.

Mechanical,33,G-META-14-27,MCQS-NUM,38,"A tensile specimen was deformed to a true strain of 0.405. The change in the gauge length was 5 mm. The final gauge length of the specimen, in mm, is  (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 15 (D) 18"," To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of true strain. True strain (ε), also known as natural strain, is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final gauge length (L_f) to the initial gauge length (L_i). The formula for true strain is:

\[ ε = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_i}\right) \]

Given that the true strain is 0.405, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the final gauge length (L_f):

\[ L_f = L_i \cdot e^ε \]

where e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828).

We are also given that the change in gauge length is 5 mm. Since true strain is based on the ratio of lengths and not the absolute change, we need to find the initial gauge length (L_i) before we can find the final gauge length (L_f). However, the problem does not provide the initial gauge length directly, so we must infer it from the information given.

The change in gauge length (ΔL) is the difference between the final and initial lengths:

\[ ΔL = L_f - L_i \]

Since we don't have L_i, we can't directly calculate L_f using the change in gauge length. However, we can use the true strain equation to find L_f in terms of L_i and then use the change in gauge length to find L_i.

Let's assume the initial gauge length is L_i. Then the final gauge length L_f after the deformation is:

\[ L_f = L_i \cdot e^{0.405} \]

Now, we know that:

\[ ΔL = L_f - L_i = 5 \text{ mm} \]

Substituting L_f from the true strain equation:

\[ 5 \text{ mm} = L_i \cdot e^{0.405} - L_i \]
\[ 5 \text{ mm} = L_i (e^{0.405} - 1) \]

Now we can solve for L_i:

\[ L_i = \frac{5 \text{ mm}}{e^{0.405} - 1} \]

Using the value of e and the true strain:

\[ L_i = \frac{5 \text{ mm}}{e^{0.405} - 1} \approx \frac{5 \text{ mm}}{2.71828^{0.405} - 1} \]
\[ L_i \approx \frac{5 \text{ mm}}{1.496907427 - 1} \]
\[ L_i \approx \frac{5 \text{ mm}}{0.496907427} \]
\[ L_i \approx 10.06 \text{ mm} \]

Now that we have the initial gauge length, we can find the final gauge length:

\[ L_f = L_i \cdot e^{0.405} \]
\[ L_f \approx 10.06 \text{ mm} \cdot 2.71828^{0.405} \]
\[ L_f \approx 10.06 \text{ mm} \cdot 1.496907427 \]

This critical value is associated with the yield strength of the material in simple tension or compression.

According to the Tresca yield criterion, yielding occurs when the following condition is met:

\[ \tau_{max} = \frac{\sigma_1 - \sigma_3}{2} = \frac{\sigma_y}{2} \]

- \(\tau_{max}\) is the maximum shear stress,

- \(\sigma_2 = 50\) MPa,
- \(\sigma_3 = -50\) MPa (minimum principal stress, which is compressive).

We can rearrange this formula to solve for strain (ε):

The densities of glass fibre and epoxy are $2.58 g/cm^3$ and 1.14 $g/cm^3$, respectively."," To calculate the elastic modulus of a unidirectional fibre-reinforced composite along the fibre direction, we can use the rule of mixtures for composite materials. The rule of mixtures for the elastic modulus in the fibre direction (E_parallel) is given by:

E_parallel = E_f * V_f + E_m * V_m

where:
- E_parallel is the elastic modulus of the composite in the fibre direction
- E_f is the elastic modulus of the fibres
- E_m is the elastic modulus of the matrix
- V_f is the volume fraction of the fibres
- V_m is the volume fraction of the matrix

Since the volume fractions must sum up to 1 (100%), we can also write V_m as (1 - V_f).

Given:
- E_f (elastic modulus of glass fibre) = 72.5 GPa
- E_m (elastic modulus of epoxy matrix) = 2.4 GPa
- wt.% of fibres = 60%
- wt.% of matrix = 40% (since the total must be 100%)

First, we need to convert the weight percentages to volume fractions using the densities provided:

V_f = (wt.% of fibres * density of matrix) / (wt.% of fibres * density of matrix + wt.% of matrix * density of fibres)

V_f = (0.60 * 1.14 g/cm^3) / (0.60 * 1.14 g/cm^3 + 0.40 * 2.58 g/cm^3)

V_f = (0.684 g/cm^3) / (0.684 g/cm^3 + 1.032 g/cm^3)

V_f = 0.684 / 1.716

V_f ≈ 0.40

Now we can calculate the elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction:

E_parallel = E_f * V_f + E_m * (1 - V_f)

E_parallel = 72.5 GPa * 0.40 + 2.4 GPa * (1 - 0.40)

E_parallel = 29 GPa + 1.44 GPa

E_parallel ≈ 30.44 GPa

τ_new = G * b / L_new

We can solve for G * b using the initial conditions:

G * b = τ_initial * L_initial

Now we can substitute G * b into the equation for the new stress:

τ_new = (τ_initial * L_initial) / L_new

Given:
- τ_initial = 200 MPa
- L_initial = 500 nm
- L_new = 200 nm

Now we calculate τ_new:

τ_new = (200 MPa * 500 nm) / 200 nm
τ_new = (100,000 MPa*nm) / 200 nm
τ_new = 500 MPa

Therefore, the stress required when the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm is 500 MPa.

The volume of the material remains the same before and after the forging process. Therefore, the volume of the original cylindrical billet is equal to the volume of the forged pancake.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Let's calculate the volume of the original cylindrical billet:

Given the diameter of the billet is 0.5 m, the radius \( r_{\text{billet}} \) is half of that, which is 0.25 m. The height \( h_{\text{billet}} \) is 1.0 m.

\[ V_{\text{billet}} = \pi (0.25)^2 (1.0) \]
\[ V_{\text{billet}} = \pi (0.0625) (1.0) \]
\[ V_{\text{billet}} = \pi (0.0625) \]

Now, let's denote the diameter of the pancake as \( d_{\text{pancake}} \) and the radius as \( r_{\text{pancake}} \). The height of the pancake \( h_{\text{pancake}} \) is 0.25 m.

The volume of the pancake \( V_{\text{pancake}} \) must be equal to \( V_{\text{billet}} \):

\[ V_{\text{pancake}} = \pi r_{\text{pancake}}^2 h_{\text{pancake}} \]
\[ V_{\text{pancake}} = \pi (r_{\text{pancake}})^2 (0.25) \]

Since \( V_{\text{billet}} = V_{\text{pancake}} \):

\[ \pi (0.0625) = \pi (r_{\text{pancake}})^2 (0.25) \]

We can cancel out \( \pi \) from both sides and solve for \( r_{\text{pancake}} \):

\[ 0.0625 = (r_{\text{pancake}})^2 (0.25) \]
\[ (r_{\text{pancake}})^2 = \frac{0.0625}{0.25} \]
\[ (r_{\text{pancake}})^2 = 0.25 \]
\[ r_{\text{pancake}} = \sqrt{0.25} \]
\[ r_{\text{pancake}} = 0.5 \text{ m} \]

The radius of the pancake is 0.5 m, which means the diameter \( d_{\text{pancake}} \) is twice the radius:

\[ d_{\text{pancake}} = 2 \times r_{\text{pancake}} \]
\[ d_{\text{pancake}} = 2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ d_{\text{pancake}} = 1.0 \text{ m} \]

Therefore, the diameter of the pancake after upset forging is 1.0 meter. Here is the correct answer in a list:

If the particle size is reduced to $R_2$ = 0.1 $R_1$, the corresponding driving force $∆G_2$ = α $∆G_1$ , where α is"," The driving force for sintering is related to the surface area of the particles. The surface area of a sphere is given by $4\pi r^2$. When the radius of the particles is reduced by a factor of 10 (from $R_1$ to $R_2 = 0.1R_1$), the surface area increases by a factor of 100 (since the surface area is proportional to the square of the radius).

The driving force for sintering, $\Delta G$, is proportional to the surface area of the particles because sintering reduces the total surface area and thus the surface energy of the system. Therefore, when the particle size is reduced to $R_2 = 0.1R_1$, the driving force $\Delta G_2$ will be greater than $\Delta G_1$ by the same factor that the surface area increases.

So, if the radius is reduced by a factor of 10, the surface area increases by a factor of $1/(0.1)^2 = 1/0.01 = 100$. Thus, the driving force $\Delta G_2$ for the smaller particles will be 100 times greater than $\Delta G_1$ for the larger particles.

Therefore, $\alpha = 100$ and the relationship between $\Delta G_2$ and $\Delta G_1$ is:

This material has a fracture strength of 300 MPa for a given flaw size. The same solid containing the same flaws is then tested in medium Q in which $𝛾_𝑠$= 0.1 J $m^(-2)$. The fracture strength (in MPa) in medium Q based on Griffith's theory is?," Griffith's theory states that the fracture strength (\( \sigma_f \)) of a brittle material containing a crack of length \( a \) is given by:

\[ \sigma_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma_s}{\pi a}} \]

where:
- \( E \) is the Young's modulus of the material,
- \( \gamma_s \) is the surface energy, and
- \( a \) is the crack length (flaw size).

Since the material and the flaw size are the same in both media P and Q, the Young's modulus \( E \) and the crack length \( a \) remain constant. The only variable changing is the surface energy \( \gamma_s \).

Let's denote the fracture strength in medium P as \( \sigma_{fP} \) and in medium Q as \( \sigma_{fQ} \). We can write the ratio of the fracture strengths in the two media as:

\[ \frac{\sigma_{fQ}}{\sigma_{fP}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{sQ}}{\gamma_{sP}}} \]

Given that \( \gamma_{sP} = 0.9 \) J \( m^{-2} \) and \( \gamma_{sQ} = 0.1 \) J \( m^{-2} \), and \( \sigma_{fP} = 300 \) MPa, we can solve for \( \sigma_{fQ} \):

Mechanical,42,G-META-16-19,MCQS,22,Creep resistance decreases due to  (A) Small grain size (B) Fine dispersoid size (C) Low stacking fault energy (D) High melting point ," Creep resistance is a material's ability to withstand the slow deformation that occurs under constant load or stress at high temperatures. The factors that influence creep resistance include grain size, dispersoid size, stacking fault energy, and melting point. Here's how each factor affects creep resistance:

(A) Small grain size: A smaller grain size generally increases creep resistance because it hinders the movement of dislocations. The many grain boundaries act as barriers to dislocation motion, which is beneficial for creep resistance.

(B) Fine dispersoid size: Dispersoids are fine particles of a second phase within a metal matrix. A fine dispersoid size can significantly improve creep resistance by pinning grain boundaries and dislocations, thus preventing grain growth and slip.

(C) Low stacking fault energy: Materials with low stacking fault energy tend to have a higher resistance to cross-slip, which is a mechanism that can lead to creep. Therefore, low stacking fault energy can improve creep resistance.

(D) High melting point: A high melting point typically indicates strong atomic bonding within the material. Stronger bonds mean that the material can withstand higher temperatures before it starts to deform, which improves creep resistance.

Based on the above explanations, the factor that decreases creep resistance is not directly listed. However, if we consider the opposite of the factors that increase creep resistance, we can infer that:

- A large grain size would decrease creep resistance (opposite of A).
- A coarse dispersoid size would decrease creep resistance (opposite of B).
- High stacking fault energy would decrease creep resistance (opposite of C).
- A low melting point would decrease creep resistance (opposite of D).

Given the options provided in the question, the correct answer is the one that is not typically associated with increased creep resistance. Since options B, C, and D are generally associated with increased creep resistance when they are fine, small, or high, respectively, the remaining option A, ""Small grain size,"" is incorrect in the context of the question as it actually increases creep resistance.

Therefore, the factor that is not typically associated with increased creep resistance and could be inferred to decrease it would be:

\[ E_{transverse} = E_{polymer} \cdot V_{polymer} + E_{glass fiber} \cdot V_{glass fiber} \]

- Wire Drawing (P): This process involves pulling a wire through a die to reduce its diameter. The primary stress involved here is tension (the wire is being stretched).

- Forging (Q): Forging is a process where metal is shaped under pressure. The primary stress involved in forging is direct compression, as the metal is compressed into shape.

- Stretch Forming (R): In stretch forming, a sheet of metal is stretched over a die and formed into shape. This process primarily involves tension, as the metal is stretched to conform to the die.

The ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is? (answer up to three decimal places)," To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of resilience and toughness in the context of material properties.

Resilience is a measure of a material's ability to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically, and it is represented by the area under the stress-strain curve up to the yield point. For a perfectly elastic-plastic material, the stress-strain curve is rectangular up to the yield point, so the resilience (U_r) is simply the yield stress (σ_y) times the yield strain (ε_y).

Toughness, on the other hand, is a measure of a material's ability to absorb energy until it fractures, and it is represented by the total area under the stress-strain curve up to the point of fracture. For a perfectly elastic-plastic material, the stress remains constant at the yield stress until the material fractures at a certain strain. Therefore, the toughness (U_t) is the yield stress times the fracture strain (ε_f).

Given:
- Young's modulus (E) = 4.5 GPa = 4500 MPa
- Yield stress (σ_y) = 450 MPa
- Fracture strain (ε_f) = 0.45

Since the material is perfectly elastic-plastic, the yield strain (ε_y) can be calculated using Hooke's Law, which states that stress is equal to the product of Young's modulus and strain:
ε_y = σ_y / E

Now we can calculate ε_y and then determine both resilience and toughness.

ε_y = 450 MPa / 4500 MPa
ε_y = 0.1

Resilience (U_r) is the area of the rectangle formed by the elastic part of the stress-strain curve:
U_r = σ_y * ε_y
U_r = 450 MPa * 0.1
U_r = 45 MPa

Toughness (U_t) is the area of the rectangle formed by the yield stress and the fracture strain:
U_t = σ_y * ε_f
U_t = 450 MPa * 0.45
U_t = 202.5 MPa

The ratio of resilience to toughness is:
Ratio = U_r / U_t
Ratio = 45 MPa / 202.5 MPa
Ratio ≈ 0.222

Therefore, the ratio of resilience to toughness for this material, up to three decimal places, is:

Pick the correct answer based on the information provided above: Note: The glass fibre contains a population of flaws of different lengths.  (A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture (B) The fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture (D) The fibre will undergo buckling"," To determine the behavior of the glass fiber under the given conditions, we need to consider the stress applied, the material properties, and the presence of flaws.

Given:
- Diameter of the fiber, \( d = 5 \) microns \( = 5 \times 10^{-6} \) meters
- Tensile stress, \( \sigma = 20 \) MPa \( = 20 \times 10^6 \) Pa
- Surface energy, \( \gamma = 0.3 \) \( Jm^{-2} \)
- Elastic modulus, \( E = 70 \) GPa \( = 70 \times 10^9 \) Pa

First, let's calculate the Griffith criterion for brittle fracture, which relates the critical stress for fracture to the surface energy and the size of the flaw. The Griffith equation is given by:

\[ \sigma_c = \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma}{\pi a}} \]

where \( \sigma_c \) is the critical stress for fracture, and \( a \) is the flaw size. We don't have the exact flaw size, but we can determine the critical stress for fracture if we assume a flaw size. For brittle materials like glass, the flaw size is often on the order of microstructural features or introduced defects. Let's assume a flaw size \( a \) of \( 1 \) micron \( = 10^{-6} \) meters for the purpose of this calculation.

\[ \sigma_c = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 70 \times 10^9 \times 0.3}{10^{-6} \times \pi}} \]

\[ \sigma_c = \sqrt{\frac{42 \times 10^9}{10^{-6} \times \pi}} \]

\[ \sigma_c = \sqrt{\frac{42 \times 10^{15}}{\pi}} \]

\[ \sigma_c \approx \sqrt{13.4 \times 10^{15}} \]

\[ \sigma_c \approx 3.66 \times 10^7 \text{ Pa} \]

\[ \sigma_c \approx 36.6 \text{ MPa} \]

Since the applied stress (20 MPa) is less than the critical stress for fracture (36.6 MPa), the fiber will not undergo brittle fracture under these conditions.

Next, we need to check if the fiber will undergo plastic deformation. For this, we compare the applied stress to the yield strength of the material. Glass fibers are typically brittle and do not exhibit a yield point at room temperature. Instead, they fail by brittle fracture. However, since the applied stress is below the critical stress for fracture, the fiber will not fracture.

Given that the applied stress is below the critical stress for fracture and that glass fibers do not typically undergo plastic deformation, the fiber will undergo elastic deformation. When the stress is removed, the fiber will return to its original length without any permanent deformation.

Buckling is a failure mode that occurs under compressive stress, not tensile stress, so option (D) can be ruled out.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is:

The rule of mixtures for a composite with continuous fibers in the direction of the load is given by:

\[ E_c = E_f V_f + E_m V_m \]

where:
- \( E_c \) is the Young's modulus of the composite,
- \( E_f \) is the Young's modulus of the fibers,
- \( V_f \) is the volume fraction of the fibers,
- \( E_m \) is the Young's modulus of the matrix,
- \( V_m \) is the volume fraction of the matrix.

Given:
- \( E_f = 250 \) GPa,
- \( E_m = 2.5 \) GPa,
- \( V_f = 0.25 \) (25 vol. %),
- \( V_m = 1 - V_f = 0.75 \) (since the total volume fraction must sum to 1).

We can calculate the Young's modulus of the composite \( E_c \) as follows:

\[ E_c = (250 \text{ GPa})(0.25) + (2.5 \text{ GPa})(0.75) \]
\[ E_c = 62.5 \text{ GPa} + 1.875 \text{ GPa} \]
\[ E_c = 64.375 \text{ GPa} \]

The fraction of load \( F \) borne by the fibers can be calculated by the ratio of the stiffness of the fibers to the stiffness of the composite:

\[ F = \frac{E_f V_f}{E_c} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ F = \frac{(250 \text{ GPa})(0.25)}{64.375 \text{ GPa}} \]
\[ F = \frac{62.5 \text{ GPa}}{64.375 \text{ GPa}} \]

- **Coble creep** involves grain boundary diffusion, where atoms diffuse along the grain boundaries. This mechanism is more prominent in materials with smaller grain sizes because the diffusion distance is shorter, and the grain boundary area is larger.

Temperature also plays a role in both mechanisms. Higher temperatures increase the diffusion rate of atoms, which enhances both Nabarro-Herring and Coble creep.

Given this information, we can deduce that:

- Nabarro-Herring creep is favored by larger grain sizes and higher temperatures because the lattice diffusion path is longer, and the diffusion rate increases with temperature.

- Coble creep is favored by smaller grain sizes and higher temperatures because the grain boundary diffusion path is shorter, and the diffusion rate increases with temperature.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:

(C) larger grain size and higher temperature

The ratio ($𝜎_(1)/𝜎_(2)$) of the fracture strength of the two samples is   (A) 0.5 (B) 1.0 (C) 2.0 (D) 4.0," To solve this problem, we can use the principle that the fracture strength (σ) of a material is inversely proportional to the square root of the length of the internal crack (c), as described by the Griffith theory for brittle materials. This relationship is given by:

\[ \sigma \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{c}} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the fracture strengths of the two samples is:

\[ \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{c_1}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{c_2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{c_2}{c_1}} \]

Given the lengths of the internal cracks for the two samples:

\[ c_1 = 0.5 \text{ mm} \]
\[ c_2 = 2 \text{ mm} \]

\[ \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{0.5}} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]

As the bottom of the rod is pulled away from the wall, the top of the rod slides down the wall. The movement of the bottom end of the rod and the movement of the top end of the rod are related by the geometry of the situation.

Let's denote:
- \( v_b \) as the velocity of the bottom end of the rod moving away from the wall, which is given as 4 cm/s.
- \( v_t \) as the velocity of the top end of the rod sliding down the wall, which we want to find.
- \( h \) as the height of the rod from the bottom end to the top end, which is 50 cm.
- \( d \) as the distance of the bottom end of the rod from the wall, which starts at 30 cm and is increasing at a rate of \( v_b \).

At any instant, the ratio of the velocities \( v_t \) and \( v_b \) is equal to the ratio of the corresponding sides of the similar triangles formed by the wall, the rod, and the ground:

\[ \frac{v_t}{v_b} = \frac{d}{h} \]

We can solve for \( v_t \):

\[ v_t = v_b \cdot \frac{d}{h} \]

Given that \( v_b = 4 \) cm/s and \( h = 50 \) cm, we need to find the instantaneous value of \( d \) as the bottom of the rod is pulled away. However, since the question asks for the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod as the bottom is just starting to move (indicated by the initial distance of 30 cm), we can assume that \( d \) is still approximately 30 cm for this instantaneous calculation.

Plugging in the values:

\[ v_t = 4 \text{ cm/s} \cdot \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{50 \text{ cm}} \]
\[ v_t = 4 \cdot \frac{3}{5} \]
\[ v_t = 2.4 \text{ cm/s} \]

Rounded off to two decimal places, the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod sliding down the wall is:

If the volume % of B is 25%, the elastic modulus (in GPa, rounded off to one decimal place) of the material is"," To find the elastic modulus of the composite material made up of alternating layers of metals A and B, we can use the rule of mixtures for composite materials. Since the volume percentage of material B is given as 25%, the volume percentage of material A must be the remaining 75%.

The rule of mixtures for the elastic modulus (E) of a composite material with layers oriented in the direction of the load is given by:

\[ E = E_A V_A + E_B V_B \]

where:
- \( E \) is the elastic modulus of the composite material,
- \( E_A \) and \( E_B \) are the elastic moduli of materials A and B, respectively,

- \( E_B = 100 \) GPa,
- \( V_B = 25\% \) (which means \( V_A = 75\% \) since \( V_A + V_B = 100\% \)).

Now we can calculate the elastic modulus of the composite material:

\[ E = (200 \text{ GPa})(0.75) + (100 \text{ GPa})(0.25) \]
\[ E = 150 \text{ GPa} + 25 \text{ GPa} \]

However, since the question specifically asks for the number of independent elastic constants, and considering that the bulk modulus (K) and shear modulus (G) can also be used to describe the material's behavior, but can be derived from E and ν, the most concise answer is that there is only one independent elastic constant that cannot be derived from the others.

- Fine-grained microstructure: A fine grain size is essential for superplasticity because it allows for the easy movement of grain boundaries, which is one of the mechanisms by which superplastic materials deform.
- High strain-rate sensitivity: This means that the flow stress of the material is highly dependent on the rate at which it is deformed. High strain-rate sensitivity is crucial for superplasticity because it allows the material to accommodate the strain without localized deformation.

In cold-rolling, for the sheet to be drawn into rolls, the angel of contact(in degress) (or angle of bite) should be less than or equal to?(round off to one decimal places)"," To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the angle of contact, also known as the angle of bite, in the context of cold-rolling. The angle of bite is the angle subtended by the two points of contact between the roll and the sheet at the center of the roll.

For the sheet to be drawn into the rolls without slipping, the frictional force between the sheet and the roll must be sufficient to overcome the tangential component of the force due to the angle of bite. The condition for the sheet to be drawn into the rolls can be expressed by the following inequality:

\[ \mu \geq \tan(\alpha) \]

where:
- \( \mu \) is the coefficient of friction between the sheet and the roll,
- \( \alpha \) is the angle of contact (or angle of bite).

Given that the coefficient of friction \( \mu \) is 0.1, we want to find the maximum angle of contact \( \alpha \) such that the sheet will be drawn into the rolls without slipping. We can rearrange the inequality to solve for \( \alpha \):

\[ \alpha \leq \arctan(\mu) \]

Substituting the given coefficient of friction:

\[ \alpha \leq \arctan(0.1) \]

Now we calculate the angle:

\[ \alpha \leq \arctan(0.1) \approx \arctan(0.1) \]

Using a calculator, we find:

\[ \alpha \leq \arctan(0.1) \approx 5.71^\circ \]

Rounded to one decimal place, the maximum angle of contact for the sheet to be drawn into the rolls is:

(D) Maximum true stress does not correspond to the maximum load."," To answer the question, let's examine each statement:

(A) True stress is always higher than the engineering stress.
- This statement is generally TRUE. Engineering stress is calculated based on the original cross-sectional area, while true stress is calculated based on the actual cross-sectional area at any given moment during deformation. As the material necks down, the actual cross-sectional area decreases, which means that the true stress, which accounts for this decrease, will be higher than the engineering stress.

(B) At the ultimate stress point on the true stress-strain curve, dσ/dε = 0.
- This statement is TRUE. The ultimate stress point on the true stress-strain curve represents the maximum stress that the material can withstand before necking occurs. At this point, the rate of change of stress with respect to strain (dσ/dε) is zero because it is the peak of the stress-strain curve.

(C) Resilience is the area under the elastic region of the engineering stress-strain curve.
- This statement is TRUE. Resilience is defined as the ability of a material to absorb energy elastically without undergoing permanent deformation. It is quantified as the area under the stress-strain curve up to the elastic limit, which corresponds to the elastic region of the engineering stress-strain curve.

(D) Maximum true stress does not correspond to the maximum load.
- This statement is FALSE. The maximum true stress corresponds to the point where the load reaches its maximum value during a tensile test, which is at the onset of necking. After this point, the cross-sectional area begins to decrease faster than the load can increase, leading to a decrease in engineering stress. However, the true stress continues to increase until fracture because it accounts for the reduced cross-sectional area. Therefore, the maximum true stress does indeed correspond to the maximum load.

Based on the analysis, the FALSE statement is:

(D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion," To answer the question, let's review each option:

(A) The minimum creep rate is obtained in the primary stage (stage I) - This statement is FALSE. The minimum creep rate is typically obtained in the secondary stage (stage II), also known as the steady-state creep. In the primary stage (stage I), the creep rate decreases with time.

(B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size - This statement is generally TRUE. Finer grain sizes usually increase creep resistance because they hinder dislocation movement and provide more grain boundaries to impede the propagation of creep.

(C) Coble creep occurs via grain boundary diffusion - This statement is TRUE. Coble creep is a mechanism of creep deformation that occurs primarily by diffusion of atoms along grain boundaries.

(D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion - This statement is TRUE. Nabarro-Herring creep is a type of creep that occurs due to the diffusion of atoms through the lattice, which is different from grain boundary diffusion.

If the applied tensile stress is 100 MPa and the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) is 25 MPa, which one of the following slip systems will be activated?  (A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1) (B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1) (C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1) (D) [0 1 1](1 1 -1)"," To determine which slip system will be activated, we need to calculate the resolved shear stress on the given slip systems under the applied tensile stress along the [1 1 2] direction. The slip system that has the highest resolved shear stress above the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) will be the one to activate.

The resolved shear stress (\( \tau_{RSS} \)) on a slip system can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \tau_{RSS} = \sigma \cdot (cos\phi \cdot cos\lambda) \]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the applied tensile stress (100 MPa in this case),
- \( \phi \) is the angle between the tensile axis and the slip plane normal,
- \( \lambda \) is the angle between the tensile axis and the slip direction.

We will calculate \( \phi \) and \( \lambda \) for each slip system and then determine the \( \tau_{RSS} \).

The slip systems given are:
(A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1)
(B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1)
(C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1)
(D) [0 1 1](1 1 -1)

To find \( \phi \) and \( \lambda \), we need to calculate the dot product between the tensile axis and the slip plane normal, and between the tensile axis and the slip direction, respectively. Then we use the arccosine function to find the angles.

Let's denote the tensile axis as \( T = [1 1 2] \).

For slip system (A):
- Slip plane normal \( N_A = [1 1 1] \)
- Slip direction \( D_A = [-1 0 1] \)

\[ \cos\phi_A = \frac{T \cdot N_A}{|T||N_A|} = \frac{[1 1 2] \cdot [1 1 1]}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{1+1+2}{\sqrt{6}\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{18}} \]

\[ \cos\lambda_A = \frac{T \cdot D_A}{|T||D_A|} = \frac{[1 1 2] \cdot [-1 0 1]}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{-1+0+2}{\sqrt{6}\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \]

\[ \tau_{RSS,A} = \sigma \cdot (\cos\phi_A \cdot \cos\lambda_A) \]

We would repeat this calculation for each slip system (B), (C), and (D), and then compare the \( \tau_{RSS} \) values to the CRSS of 25 MPa.

However, since the question does not require a detailed calculation and is asking for the correct answer based on the given options, we can use a shortcut by recognizing that the slip system with the largest Schmid factor (the product of \( \cos\phi \) and \( \cos\lambda \)) will be the one that activates first, as it will have the highest resolved shear stress for a given applied stress.

By inspection, we can see that slip system (C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1) has the slip direction [1 0 1] which is parallel to the tensile axis [1 1 2], making the angle \( \lambda \) zero degrees. This results in \( \cos\lambda = 1 \), which maximizes the resolved shear stress.

Therefore, without further calculations, we can determine that slip system (C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1) will be activated because it has the highest Schmid factor and thus the highest resolved shear stress under the applied tensile stress.

First, we need to relate the reduction in area to the strain. The engineering strain \( \varepsilon_E \) for a reduction in area can be approximated by:

\[ \varepsilon_E = \ln\left(\frac{A_0}{A}\right) \]

where \( A_0 \) is the initial area and \( A \) is the final area. For a 50% reduction in area:

\[ A = 0.5 \cdot A_0 \]

So the engineering strain is:

\[ \varepsilon_E = \ln\left(\frac{A_0}{0.5 \cdot A_0}\right) = \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \]

However, the strain \( \varepsilon \) used in the stress-strain relationship is true strain, not engineering strain. For processes like rolling, the true strain can be approximated as the engineering strain for small strains, which is the case here.

To find the maximum strain, we need to determine the point where the stress reaches its maximum value. This can be done by taking the derivative of stress with respect to strain and setting it equal to zero to find the critical point.

First, let's differentiate the stress with respect to strain:

\[ \frac{d\sigma}{d\varepsilon} = \frac{d}{d\varepsilon} (1050 \cdot \varepsilon^{0.25}) \]

\[ \frac{d\sigma}{d\varepsilon} = 1050 \cdot \frac{d}{d\varepsilon} (\varepsilon^{0.25}) \]

\[ \frac{d\sigma}{d\varepsilon} = 1050 \cdot 0.25 \cdot \varepsilon^{-0.75} \]

\[ \frac{d\sigma}{d\varepsilon} = 262.5 \cdot \varepsilon^{-0.75} \]

Now, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical strain:

\[ 262.5 \cdot \varepsilon^{-0.75} = 0 \]

However, since the constant multiplier will never be zero, we need to look at the exponent of ε. The derivative will approach zero as ε becomes very large, but in the context of material behavior, we are interested in the point before the material starts to neck, which is when the derivative is zero and before it becomes negative.

In a real-world scenario, the maximum uniform strain occurs just before the onset of necking, which is indicated by a decrease in the engineering stress even though the true stress continues to increase. For a power-law hardening material like the one described, the maximum uniform strain occurs at the instantaneous slope of the true stress-true strain curve that equals the current true stress value. This is known as the Considère criterion, which states that necking begins when:

\[ \sigma = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{d\sigma}{d\varepsilon} \]

Substituting our stress-strain relationship and its derivative into the Considère criterion:

\[ 1050 \cdot \varepsilon^{0.25} = \varepsilon \cdot (262.5 \cdot \varepsilon^{-0.75}) \]

\[ 1050 \cdot \varepsilon^{0.25} = 262.5 \cdot \varepsilon^{0.25} \]

Dividing both sides by \( \varepsilon^{0.25} \) and by 262.5:

\[ \frac{1050}{262.5} = \varepsilon^{0.25 - (-0.75)} \]

\[ 4 = \varepsilon \]

Therefore, the maximum true uniform strain \( \varepsilon \) that can be imparted to the material is:

\[ \varepsilon = 4 \]

(A) a is true but r is false (B) a is false but r is true (C) both a and r are true, and r is the reason for a (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a"," To answer this question, let's analyze both the Assertion (a) and the Reason (r) based on metallurgical principles:

Assertion (a): Peak aging time for an Al-4 wt.% Cu alloy is indicated by a maximum in the hardness.
This assertion is true. In age-hardening aluminum alloys, such as Al-Cu alloys, the peak hardness is typically reached when the optimal size and distribution of precipitates are achieved within the aluminum matrix. During the aging process, the alloy is heated to a specific temperature to allow the diffusion of copper atoms and the formation of precipitates, which initially are in the form of Guinier-Preston (GP) zones. As aging progresses, these zones transform into metastable θ'' precipitates, and eventually into stable θ' and θ (Al2Cu) precipitates. The peak hardness is usually associated with the presence of the metastable θ'' precipitates, which are most effective at hindering dislocation movement, thus increasing the hardness and strength of the alloy.

Reason (r): The maximum volume fraction of the θ precipitates is formed at the peak aging time.
This reason is true to a certain extent. The peak hardness is indeed associated with a certain volume fraction of precipitates, but it is not necessarily the maximum volume fraction of the stable θ phase. Instead, it is often associated with the metastable θ'' phase, which is more effective at strengthening the alloy. The maximum volume fraction of the stable θ phase would typically be reached after the peak hardness has been achieved, and over-aging begins, leading to a decrease in hardness as the precipitates grow larger and become less effective at impeding dislocation motion.

Given the above analysis:

- The Assertion (a) is true: The peak aging time is indeed indicated by a maximum in hardness.
- The Reason (r) is true but requires clarification: The peak hardness correlates with the optimal volume fraction of metastable precipitates (θ''), not necessarily the maximum volume fraction of the stable θ phase.

Considering the relationship between the Assertion and the Reason, the correct answer is:

(D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a

This is because while both the assertion and the reason are true, the reason provided does not fully explain the assertion. The peak hardness is not due to the maximum volume fraction of the θ precipitates but rather the optimal distribution and size of the metastable precipitates at the peak aging time.

We can substitute this into the work equation and integrate with respect to \(\varepsilon\):

\[ W = \int_0^{0.3} 200 \varepsilon^{0.25} \, d\varepsilon \]

To integrate, we use the power rule for integration:

\[ W = \left[ \frac{200}{0.25 + 1} \varepsilon^{0.25 + 1} \right]_0^{0.3} \]
\[ W = \left[ \frac{200}{1.25} \varepsilon^{1.25} \right]_0^{0.3} \]

The Griffith criterion states that a crack will propagate when the release of elastic strain energy is at least equal to the energy required to create new crack surfaces.

The critical stress intensity factor (\(K_{IC}\)) for a material can be related to the fracture toughness and is given by:

\[ K_{IC} = \sqrt{2E\gamma} \]

- \(E\) is the Young's Modulus,
- \(\gamma\) is the surface energy per unit area.

For the internal crack, the stress intensity factor (\(K\)) for a through-thickness crack in an infinite plate under tensile stress (\(\sigma\)) is given by:

\[ K = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a} \]

where \(a\) is the half-length of the crack. For the internal crack of length 5 μm, \(a = 2.5 \times 10^{-6}\) m.

For the surface crack, the stress intensity factor is different because it's not a through-thickness crack. For a semi-elliptical surface crack under tensile stress, the stress intensity factor at the deepest point of the crack (where it is most severe) can be approximated by:

\[ K = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a} \cdot f \left( \frac{a}{c}, \frac{a}{t} \right) \]

where:
- \(a\) is the depth of the crack,
- \(c\) is the half-length of the crack along the surface,
- \(t\) is the thickness of the plate,
- \(f\) is a correction factor that accounts for the geometry of the crack and the finite thickness of the plate.

For simplicity, we will assume that the surface crack is shallow enough that the correction factor \(f\) is approximately 1, which is a common assumption for surface cracks in thin plates. Thus, for the surface crack of length 3 μm, \(a = 1.5 \times 10^{-6}\) m (assuming it's a semi-circle).

Now, let's calculate the fracture stress for both cracks:

1. For the internal crack:
\[ K_{IC} = \sqrt{2E\gamma} \]
\[ K_{IC} = \sqrt{2 \times 70 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa} \times 1 \text{ J/m}^2} \]

\[ K_{IC} = \sqrt{140 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa} \cdot \text{m}} \]
\[ K_{IC} = 11.83 \times 10^4 \text{ Pa} \cdot \sqrt{\text{m}} \]

The critical stress (\(\sigma_c\)) for the internal crack is:
\[ \sigma_c = \frac{K_{IC}}{\sqrt{\pi a}} \]
\[ \sigma_c = \frac{11.83 \times 10^4 \text{ Pa} \cdot \sqrt{\text{m}}}{\sqrt{\pi \times 2.5 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}} \]

The tensile stress (in MPa) required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane is?," To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the applied tensile stress and the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) on the slip plane in a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal.

In an FCC crystal, the slip system consists of a slip plane and a slip direction. The most common slip plane is the {111} plane, and the most common slip direction is the <110> direction. When a tensile stress is applied along the [100] direction, we need to resolve this stress onto the slip plane along the slip direction to determine the shear stress acting on that plane.

The Schmid factor (m) relates the applied tensile stress (σ) to the resolved shear stress (τ) on the slip plane in the slip direction:

τ = m * σ

The Schmid factor can be calculated using the angles between the tensile axis, the normal to the slip plane, and the slip direction. For the FCC crystal, the angle (φ) between the [100] direction and the [110] slip direction in the (111) plane is 45 degrees (or π/4 radians). The Schmid factor for this geometry is given by:

m = cos(φ) * cos(λ)

where λ is the angle between the tensile axis and the normal to the slip plane, which in this case is also 45 degrees because the [100] direction is at 45 degrees to the (111) plane.

Therefore, the Schmid factor is:

m = cos(π/4) * cos(π/4) = (1/√2) * (1/√2) = 1/2

Now we can solve for the tensile stress (σ) required to initiate slip:

τ = m * σ
6 MPa = (1/2) * σ
σ = 6 MPa * 2
σ = 12 MPa

The tensile stress required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane when a tensile stress is applied along the [100] direction in a FCC metal crystal is 12 MPa.

Given:
- Green density is 55% of theoretical density.
- Sintered density is 86.5% of theoretical density.

- Crack length (\( 2a \)) = 2 µm = \( 2 \times 10^{-6} \) m (since 1 µm = \( 10^{-6} \) m).

\[ E = 60 \times 10^9 \, \text{Pa} \]
\[ a = \frac{2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}}{2} = 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \]

The power law equation given is:

\[ \sigma = 50 \cdot \varepsilon^{0.3} \]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the flow stress of the material
- \( \varepsilon \) is the true strain

The true strain per pass in wire drawing can be related to the area reduction per pass by the following equation:

\[ \varepsilon = \ln\left(\frac{A_0}{A_1}\right) \]

where:
- \( A_0 \) is the initial cross-sectional area before the pass
- \( A_1 \) is the final cross-sectional area after the pass

For wire drawing, the area reduction per pass is typically small, so we can approximate the true strain per pass using the natural logarithm of the ratio of the areas. The maximum strain per pass in annealed condition would be when the material is just at the verge of plastic deformation, which means the flow stress \( \sigma \) is equal to the yield stress \( \sigma_y \) of the material in the annealed condition.

Since we do not have the yield stress value given, we will assume that the maximum strain per pass occurs at a certain fraction of the flow stress. However, the question does not provide a specific criterion for the maximum strain per pass, such as a percentage of the flow stress. Therefore, we will assume that the maximum strain per pass occurs at a flow stress equal to the yield stress, which we will denote as \( \sigma_y \).

\[ \varepsilon = \left(\frac{\sigma}{50}\right)^{\frac{1}{0.3}} \]

Assuming \( \sigma = \sigma_y \), we can calculate the maximum strain per pass as:

\[ \varepsilon_{\text{max}} = \left(\frac{\sigma_y}{50}\right)^{\frac{1}{0.3}} \]

However, without the value of \( \sigma_y \), we cannot calculate a numerical value for \( \varepsilon_{\text{max}} \). The question also assumes ideal work and efficiency \( \eta = 1 \), which means there are no losses in the process, and all the work done in drawing the wire is converted into plastic deformation energy.

Since we cannot determine the maximum strain per pass without the yield stress value, we cannot provide a numerical answer to two decimal places as requested. The problem statement is incomplete as it stands, and additional information regarding the yield stress or a criterion for the maximum strain per pass is necessary to solve this problem.

Given the context provided, the answer is indeterminate. If more information were available, we could apply the above equations to find the numerical value for the maximum strain per pass.

Propogation of crack is governmed by da/dN = $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$, where, the crack length a is in meters, N is the number of cycles and ΔK is in $MPa.m^(1/2)$. The length of the crack (in m) after one million cycles will be?(answer up to three decimal places)."," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the stress intensity factor (ΔK) and then use the given Paris law equation to find the rate of crack growth per cycle (da/dN). After that, we can integrate to find the crack length after one million cycles.

Given:
- σ_max = 200 MPa
- σ_min = 0 MPa
- Initial crack length (a_i) = 1 mm = 0.001 m
- da/dN = \(10^{-12} (ΔK)^3\)
- Number of cycles (N) = 1,000,000

First, we calculate the stress intensity factor range (ΔK):
\[ ΔK = K_{max} - K_{min} \]
Since σ_min = 0, K_min = 0, and we only need to calculate K_max:
\[ K_{max} = σ_max \sqrt{\pi a_i} \]
\[ K_{max} = 200 \times 10^6 \sqrt{\pi \times 0.001} \]
\[ K_{max} = 200 \times 10^6 \sqrt{\pi \times 10^{-3}} \]
\[ K_{max} = 200 \times 10^6 \times \sqrt{\pi} \times 10^{-3/2} \]
\[ K_{max} = 200 \times 10^6 \times \sqrt{\pi} \times 10^{-1.5} \]
\[ K_{max} = 200 \times 10^6 \times \sqrt{\pi} \times 0.03162 \]
\[ K_{max} \approx 200 \times 10^6 \times 1.772 \times 0.03162 \]
\[ K_{max} \approx 11,103,000 \, Pa \cdot m^{1/2} \]
\[ K_{max} \approx 11.103 \, MPa \cdot m^{1/2} \]

Now, we have ΔK = K_max (since K_min = 0):
\[ ΔK = 11.103 \, MPa \cdot m^{1/2} \]

Next, we use the Paris law equation to find da/dN:
\[ da/dN = 10^{-12} (ΔK)^3 \]
\[ da/dN = 10^{-12} (11.103)^3 \]
\[ da/dN = 10^{-12} \times 1,367,616,000 \]
\[ da/dN \approx 1.3676 \times 10^{-3} \, m/cycle \]

Now, we integrate da/dN over the number of cycles to find the total crack growth (Δa):
\[ Δa = \int_{0}^{1,000,000} (da/dN) dN \]
Since da/dN is constant, we can simplify this to:
\[ Δa = (da/dN) \times N \]
\[ Δa = 1.3676 \times 10^{-3} \times 1,000,000 \]
\[ Δa = 1,367.6 \, m \]

This result is clearly incorrect, as the crack growth cannot be larger than the dimensions of the component itself. The mistake here is that the crack growth rate (da/dN) should be much smaller since the exponent in the Paris law equation is 3, which will significantly reduce the value of da/dN for the given ΔK. Let's correct the calculation:

\[ da/dN = 10^{-12} (11.103)^3 \]
\[ da/dN = 10^{-12} \times 1,367,616,000 \]
\[ da/dN = 1.3676 \times 10^{-3} \, m/cycle \]
This value is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the calculation with the correct exponent:

\[ da/dN = 10^{-12} (11.103)^3 \]

Mechanical,82,G-META-18-46,NUM,42,A single crystal of aluminium is subjected to 10 MPa tensile stress along the [321] crystallographic direction. What is the value of the resolved shear stress on the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system in MPa rounded off to two decimal places?," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the resolved shear stress (RSS) on the given slip system. The resolved shear stress is the component of the applied stress that acts on the slip plane in the slip direction. The formula to calculate the resolved shear stress (τ) is given by:

τ = σ * (cos(φ) * cos(λ))

where:
- σ is the applied stress (10 MPa in this case)
- φ is the angle between the tensile axis and the slip plane normal
- λ is the angle between the projection of the tensile axis onto the slip plane and the slip direction

For the slip system (1 1 -1) [1 0 1], we need to find the angles φ and λ.

First, we find the direction of the slip plane normal, which is perpendicular to the (1 1 -1) plane. The direction ratios of the slip plane normal are the same as the Miller indices of the plane, i.e., [1 1 -1].

Next, we find the direction ratios of the tensile axis, which is [3 2 1].

The angle φ can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(φ) = (a1 * b1 + a2 * b2 + a3 * b3) / (|a| * |b|)

where a = [3 2 1] and b = [1 1 -1] are the direction ratios of the tensile axis and the slip plane normal, respectively.

|a| = √(3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = √(9 + 4 + 1) = √14
|b| = √(1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2) = √(1 + 1 + 1) = √3

Now, calculate cos(φ):

cos(φ) = (3*1 + 2*1 + 1*(-1)) / (√14 * √3) = (3 + 2 - 1) / √42 = 4 / √42

Next, we need to find the projection of the tensile axis onto the slip plane and then calculate the angle λ between this projection and the slip direction [1 0 1].

The projection of the tensile axis onto the slip plane is found by subtracting the component of the tensile axis in the direction of the slip plane normal from the tensile axis itself:

Projection = a - (a . b / |b|^2) * b

We already have a . b from the previous calculation:

a . b = 4

Now, calculate the projection:

Projection = [3 2 1] - (4 / (√3)^2) * [1 1 -1]
Projection = [3 2 1] - (4 / 3) * [1 1 -1]
Projection = [3 2 1] - [4/3 4/3 -4/3]
Projection = [9/3 - 4/3, 6/3 - 4/3, 3/3 + 4/3]
Projection = [5/3 2/3 7/3]

Now, we normalize this projection vector to find the direction ratios of the projected tensile axis onto the slip plane:

|Projection| = √((5/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 + (7/3)^2) = √(25/9 + 4/9 + 49/9) = √(80/9) = √80 / 3

The direction ratios of the projection are:

[5/3 * (3/√80), 2/3 * (3/√80), 7/3 * (3/√80)] = [5/√80, 2/√80, 7/√80]

Now, we calculate cos(λ) using the dot product of the projection with the slip direction [1 0 1]:

cos(λ) = (5/√80 * 1 + 2/√80 * 0 + 7/√80 * 1) / (√80/3 * √3)
cos(λ) = (5 + 7) / √80 * √3

- Length of the billet (\( l \)) = 100 mm = 0.1 m.

First, we calculate the initial and final cross-sectional areas:

\[ A_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot d_0^2 = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (0.02)^2 \]
\[ A_f = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot d_f^2 = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (0.016)^2 \]

\[ W = 40,000,000 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (0.016)^2 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (0.02)^2}{\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (0.016)^2}\right) \]

Assume no change in the width of the plate"," To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of volume. Since the width of the plate remains constant and the material is incompressible, the volume of the plate before and after rolling must be the same.

Let's denote the following:
- \( V \) = volume of the plate
- \( w \) = width of the plate (which remains constant)
- \( t_{initial} \) = initial thickness of the plate
- \( t_{final} \) = final thickness of the plate
- \( v_{entry} \) = entry velocity of the plate
- \( v_{exit} \) = exit velocity of the plate

\[ V_{initial} = w \times t_{initial} \times v_{entry} \]

The volume of the plate after rolling is:
\[ V_{final} = w \times t_{final} \times v_{exit} \]

Since the volume is conserved, we have:
\[ V_{initial} = V_{final} \]
\[ w \times t_{initial} \times v_{entry} = w \times t_{final} \times v_{exit} \]

The Schmid Law states that the slip system with the highest resolved shear stress will be the first to be activated.

The resolved shear stress on a slip system can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \tau = \sigma \cdot \cos(\phi) \cdot \cos(\lambda) \]

where:
- \( \tau \) is the resolved shear stress on the slip system.
- \( \sigma \) is the applied tensile stress.
- \( \phi \) is the angle between the tensile axis and the slip plane normal.
- \( \lambda \) is the angle between the tensile axis and the slip direction.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]
- \( \phi \) is the angle between [1 -1 0] and [1 -1 -1], which is 0 degrees (since they are parallel).
- \( \lambda \) is the angle between [1 -1 0] and [0 -1 1], which is not 0 degrees.

(B) (-1 -1 1)[011]
- \( \phi \) is the angle between [1 -1 0] and [-1 -1 1], which is not 0 degrees.
- \( \lambda \) is the angle between [1 -1 0] and [011], which is not 0 degrees.

(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]
- \( \phi \) is the angle between [1 -1 0] and [-1 -1 1], which is not 0 degrees.
- \( \lambda \) is the angle between [1 -1 0] and [1 -1 0], which is 0 degrees (since they are the same direction).

The maximum possible reduction (in 𝑚𝑚, rounded off to one decimal place) of a 100 mm thick slab during rolling is"," To solve the problem of finding the maximum possible reduction of a slab during rolling, we need to consider the frictional forces involved and the geometry of the rolling process.

The coefficient of friction (μ) between the roll and the slab is given as 0.2, and the diameter (D) of the roll is 200 mm (or 0.2 m, since we will use meters for calculations).

The maximum reduction possible without slipping is determined by the frictional force between the roll and the slab. This frictional force must be sufficient to prevent slipping, which occurs when the tangential force due to friction is equal to the horizontal component of the force exerted by the roll on the slab.

The vertical force (F_v) exerted by the roll on the slab is the weight of the slab per unit length, which can be calculated if we know the width and density of the slab. However, since this information is not provided, we will consider the force necessary to cause yielding in the slab, which is the force that will cause plastic deformation and thus reduction in thickness.

The maximum frictional force (F_f) that can be exerted without slipping is given by:

F_f = μ * F_v

The horizontal force (F_h) that causes reduction is related to the vertical force by the coefficient of friction:

F_h = F_v * tan(α)

where α is the angle of contact between the roll and the slab. For small reductions, we can approximate tan(α) ≈ α, and since α is small, we can also approximate α ≈ h_r / R, where h_r is the reduction in thickness and R is the radius of the roll.

Setting the frictional force equal to the horizontal force to prevent slipping:

μ * F_v = F_v * (h_r / R)

Simplifying, we get:

μ = h_r / R

Solving for h_r (maximum reduction):

h_r = μ * R

Now we can plug in the values:

μ = 0.2
R = D/2 = 0.2 m / 2 = 0.1 m

h_r = 0.2 * 0.1 m
h_r = 0.02 m

Since we need the answer in millimeters, we convert meters to millimeters:

h_r = 0.02 m * 1000 mm/m = 20 mm

(round off to the neareest integer)."," To determine the maximum allowed tensile stress on the component, we can use the fracture mechanics equation for the stress intensity factor, \( K \), which is given by:

\[ K = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a} \]

where:
- \( K \) is the stress intensity factor,
- \( \sigma \) is the applied stress,
- \( a \) is the crack length.

The fracture toughness \( K_{1c} \) is the critical value of \( K \) at which a crack will propagate and cause failure. It is given as 30 MPa\(m^{1/2}\).

The crack geometry factor, \( Y \), is assumed to be unity (1), which means the crack is in an infinite plate and the geometry factor does not affect the stress intensity.

The smallest crack that can be detected by the NDT technique is 1mm (0.001m).

We want to calculate the maximum allowed tensile stress \( \sigma_{max} \) with a 10% margin of safety. This means that the actual stress intensity factor at failure should be 90% of \( K_{1c} \):

\[ K_{max} = 0.9 \cdot K_{1c} \]

Now, we can solve for \( \sigma_{max} \) using the modified equation:

\[ K_{max} = \sigma_{max} \sqrt{\pi a} \]

\[ \sigma_{max} = \frac{K_{max}}{\sqrt{\pi a}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ K_{max} = 0.9 \cdot 30 \text{ MPa}\sqrt{m} = 27 \text{ MPa}\sqrt{m} \]

\[ a = 0.001m \]

\[ \sigma_{max} = \frac{27 \text{ MPa}\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{\pi \cdot 0.001m}} \]

\[ \sigma_{max} = \frac{27 \text{ MPa}\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{\pi} \cdot \sqrt{0.001m}} \]

The creep rate at a temperature of x K (round off to the nearest integer) will be 5 times the creep rate at 890 K. Find x. ," To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the temperature and the creep rate. We are given that the creep rate increases by a factor of 20 when the temperature increases from 890K to 980K. We are also told that we want to find a temperature, x K, at which the creep rate is 5 times the creep rate at 890 K.

Let's denote the creep rate at 890K as \( C_{890} \). According to the information given, the creep rate at 980K, \( C_{980} \), is 20 times \( C_{890} \):

\[ C_{980} = 20 \cdot C_{890} \]

We want to find the temperature x K where the creep rate \( C_x \) is 5 times \( C_{890} \):

\[ C_x = 5 \cdot C_{890} \]

Now, we assume that the relationship between the creep rate and temperature is exponential, which is a common assumption for many physical processes, including creep:

\[ C = A \cdot e^{B/T} \]

where:
- \( C \) is the creep rate,
- \( A \) is a constant,
- \( B \) is a constant related to the activation energy for creep,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin,
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

Using the information given for the creep rates at 890K and 980K, we can write two equations:

\[ C_{890} = A \cdot e^{B/890} \]
\[ C_{980} = A \cdot e^{B/980} \]

Dividing the second equation by the first gives us:

\[ \frac{C_{980}}{C_{890}} = \frac{A \cdot e^{B/980}}{A \cdot e^{B/890}} \]

Since \( A \) is a constant, it cancels out:

\[ \frac{C_{980}}{C_{890}} = \frac{e^{B/980}}{e^{B/890}} \]

Given that \( C_{980} = 20 \cdot C_{890} \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 20 = \frac{e^{B/980}}{e^{B/890}} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives us:

\[ \ln(20) = \frac{B}{980} - \frac{B}{890} \]

Now, we need to solve for \( B \). To do this, we can rearrange the equation:

\[ \ln(20) = B \left( \frac{1}{980} - \frac{1}{890} \right) \]

\[ B = \frac{\ln(20)}{\left( \frac{1}{980} - \frac{1}{890} \right)} \]

Once we have \( B \), we can use the equation for \( C_x \) to find the temperature x K:

\[ C_x = 5 \cdot C_{890} = A \cdot e^{B/x} \]

\[ 5 = \frac{A \cdot e^{B/x}}{A \cdot e^{B/890}} \]

\[ 5 = e^{B/x - B/890} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln(5) = \frac{B}{x} - \frac{B}{890} \]

Now we can solve for x:

\[ \ln(5) = B \left( \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{890} \right) \]

\[ \frac{\ln(5)}{B} + \frac{1}{890} = \frac{1}{x} \]

\[ x = \frac{1}{\frac{\ln(5)}{B} + \frac{1}{890}} \]

This means that the crack growth rate is proportional to the cube of the stress intensity range. The stress intensity range (ΔK) for a given material and loading condition can be expressed as:

\[ ΔK = Δσ \sqrt{\pi a} \]

where:
- Δσ is the range of the applied stress (since the mean stress is zero, Δσ is simply the amplitude of the cyclic stress).
- a is the crack length.

When the crack length (a) increases by a factor of two, the new crack length is 2a. We want to find out how much the crack growth rate (da/dN) increases as a result.

Let's denote the initial crack growth rate as (da/dN)_initial and the initial stress intensity range as (ΔK)_initial. When the crack length doubles, the new stress intensity range (ΔK)_new will be:

\[ (ΔK)_{\text{new}} = Δσ \sqrt{\pi (2a)} \]
\[ (ΔK)_{\text{new}} = Δσ \sqrt{2\pi a} \]
\[ (ΔK)_{\text{new}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot Δσ \sqrt{\pi a} \]
\[ (ΔK)_{\text{new}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot (ΔK)_{\text{initial}} \]

Since the crack growth rate is proportional to the cube of the stress intensity range, the new crack growth rate (da/dN)_new will be:

\[ \left(\frac{da}{dN}\right)_{\text{new}} \propto \left[(ΔK)_{\text{new}}\right]^3 \]
\[ \left(\frac{da}{dN}\right)_{\text{new}} \propto \left(\sqrt{2} \cdot (ΔK)_{\text{initial}}\right)^3 \]
\[ \left(\frac{da}{dN}\right)_{\text{new}} \propto 2^{3/2} \cdot \left[(ΔK)_{\text{initial}}\right]^3 \]
\[ \left(\frac{da}{dN}\right)_{\text{new}} = 2^{3/2} \cdot \left(\frac{da}{dN}\right)_{\text{initial}} \]

Now, let's calculate the factor by which the crack growth rate increases:

\[ \text{Increase factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{da}{dN}\right)_{\text{new}}}{\left(\frac{da}{dN}\right)_{\text{initial}}} = 2^{3/2} \]

\[ \text{Increase factor} = (2^{1/2})^3 \]
\[ \text{Increase factor} = (\sqrt{2})^3 \]
\[ \text{Increase factor} = \sqrt{2}^3 \]
\[ \text{Increase factor} = 2^{3/2} \]
\[ \text{Increase factor} = 2 \cdot 2^{1/2} \]
\[ \text{Increase factor} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \]

Now, we can calculate the numerical value:

\[ \text{Increase factor} = 2 \times 1.414 \approx 2.8 \]

Rounded to one decimal place, the increase factor is 2.8.

The final answer is:

- The crack growth rate will increase by a factor of 2.8.",,,0,

(D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation"," To answer the question, let's analyze each statement:

(A) An oversized solute atom would preferentially migrate below the slip plane of an edge dislocation.
- This statement is generally true. Oversized solute atoms tend to occupy sites that are less densely packed, which in the case of an edge dislocation would be below the slip plane (in the region of compression).

(B) A spherically symmetric point defect can interact with both the hydrostatic and shear stress fields of a dislocation.
- This statement is true. A spherically symmetric point defect, such as a vacancy or an interstitial atom, can interact with the hydrostatic component of the stress field around a dislocation. However, it does not interact with the shear stress field because it does not have a shear modulus.

(C) A point defect can locally modify the elastic modulus and thereby can change the interaction energy.
- This statement is true. The presence of a point defect can alter the local elastic properties, which in turn can affect the interaction energy between the defect and the dislocation.

(D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation.
- This statement is false. Vacancies are actually attracted towards the tensile region of a dislocation, not the compressive region. The tensile region has a lower atomic density, making it easier for a vacancy to form or migrate to.

Based on the analysis, the false statement is:

An infinite metal plate has a central through-thickness crack of length 80/π mm. The maximum applied stress(in Mpa) that the plate can sustain in mode I is?(round off to nearest integer)"," To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the stress intensity factor, \( K_I \), for a central through-thickness crack in an infinite plate under mode I loading, which is given by:

\[ K_I = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a} \]

where:
- \( K_I \) is the stress intensity factor for mode I (in this case, equal to the fracture toughness \( K_{1c} \)),
- \( \sigma \) is the applied stress,
- \( a \) is the half-length of the crack (since the crack is central and through-thickness, the total length is \( 2a \)).

Given:
- \( K_{1c} = 20 \) MPa \( m^{1/2} \) (fracture toughness),
- Crack length \( 2a = \frac{80}{\pi} \) mm, so \( a = \frac{80}{2\pi} \) mm.

First, we need to convert the crack length from millimeters to meters to match the units of the fracture toughness:

\[ a = \frac{80}{2\pi} \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \]

Now we can solve for the maximum applied stress \( \sigma \) using the fracture toughness \( K_{1c} \):

\[ K_{1c} = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a} \]
\[ \sigma = \frac{K_{1c}}{\sqrt{\pi a}} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \sigma = \frac{20 \text{ MPa}}{\sqrt{\pi \left( \frac{80}{2\pi} \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \right)}} \]
\[ \sigma = \frac{20 \text{ MPa}}{\sqrt{\pi \left( \frac{40}{\pi} \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \right)}} \]
\[ \sigma = \frac{20 \text{ MPa}}{\sqrt{40 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}}} \]

The strain rate sensitivity parameter is? (round off to 3 decimal places)."," The strain rate sensitivity parameter (often denoted as 'm') is a measure of how the flow stress of a material changes with the strain rate. It is defined by the following relationship:

\[ m = \frac{\partial \ln(\sigma)}{\partial \ln(\dot{\varepsilon})} \]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the flow stress,
- \( \dot{\varepsilon} \) is the strain rate.

For small changes in strain rate, this can be approximated as:

\[ m \approx \frac{\ln(\sigma_2 / \sigma_1)}{\ln(\dot{\varepsilon}_2 / \dot{\varepsilon}_1)} \]

Given the data:
- \( \sigma_1 = 50 \) MPa at \( \dot{\varepsilon}_1 = 0.1 \) \( s^{-1} \)
- \( \sigma_2 = 70 \) MPa at \( \dot{\varepsilon}_2 = 10 \) \( s^{-1} \)

If the flow behavior of the alloy is expressed by the equation, 𝜎 = 350 $𝜖^(0.3)$ MPa, the ideal plastic work(in mega joules) of deformation per unit volume is?(answer rounded off to the nearest integer). "," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume for the cold extrusion process of the aluminum alloy. The flow behavior of the alloy is given by the equation:

\[ \sigma = 350 \epsilon^{0.3} \, \text{MPa} \]

where \( \sigma \) is the flow stress in megapascals (MPa) and \( \epsilon \) is the true strain.

The true strain (\( \epsilon \)) for a cylindrical specimen undergoing a diameter reduction from \( d_0 \) to \( d \) is given by:

\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{A_0}{A}\right) \]

where \( A_0 \) is the initial cross-sectional area and \( A \) is the final cross-sectional area.

Given the initial diameter \( d_0 = 30 \) mm and the final diameter \( d = 20 \) mm, we can calculate the initial and final cross-sectional areas:

\[ A_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} d_0^2 = \frac{\pi}{4} (30 \, \text{mm})^2 \]
\[ A = \frac{\pi}{4} d^2 = \frac{\pi}{4} (20 \, \text{mm})^2 \]

Now we calculate the true strain:

\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{A_0}{A}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{\frac{\pi}{4} (30 \, \text{mm})^2}{\frac{\pi}{4} (20 \, \text{mm})^2}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{30^2}{20^2}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{9}{4}\right) \]

Next, we calculate the flow stress at this strain:

\[ \sigma = 350 \epsilon^{0.3} = 350 \left(\ln\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)\right)^{0.3} \]

The ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume \( W \) is the integral of the flow stress with respect to the true strain:

\[ W = \int_0^\epsilon \sigma \, d\epsilon \]

Since the flow stress is a function of strain, we can substitute the flow stress equation into the integral:

\[ W = \int_0^\epsilon 350 \epsilon^{0.3} \, d\epsilon \]

To solve this integral, we use the power rule for integration:

\[ W = \left[350 \frac{\epsilon^{1.3}}{1.3}\right]_0^\epsilon \]

Evaluating the integral from 0 to \( \epsilon \):

\[ W = 350 \frac{\epsilon^{1.3}}{1.3} - 0 \]

Substituting the value of \( \epsilon \):

\[ W = 350 \frac{\left(\ln\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)\right)^{1.3}}{1.3} \]

Now we calculate the numerical value of \( W \):

\[ W = 350 \frac{\left(\ln\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)\right)^{1.3}}{1.3} \approx 350 \frac{\left(\ln(2.25)\right)^{1.3}}{1.3} \approx 350 \frac{\left(0.8109\right)^{1.3}}{1.3} \approx 350 \frac{0.8109^{1.3}}{1.3} \]

\[ W \approx 350 \frac{0.528}{1.3} \approx 146.69 \]

The ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is approximately 146.69 MPa (since 1 MPa = 1 N/mm² and work is in units of N-mm/mm³, the units of MPa are equivalent to J/mm³ or MJ/m³).

To convert this to mega joules per cubic meter, we can simply use the fact that 1 MPa = 1 MJ/m³:

In the vulcanization of 50 g of natural rubber, 10 g of sulfur is added. Assuming the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is"," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected in the vulcanization of natural rubber with sulfur, given that the mer to S ratio is 1:1 by weight.

First, we need to determine the number of moles of sulfur and the number of moles of the mer (monomeric unit) of natural rubber that are present in the given quantities.

The atomic weight of sulfur (S) is given as 32 amu (atomic mass units), and the molecular weight of a mer of natural rubber is given as 68 amu.

Given quantities:
- Mass of sulfur (S) = 10 g
- Mass of natural rubber (mer) = 50 g

To find the number of moles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{molecular weight (g/mol)}} \]

For sulfur:
\[ \text{moles of S} = \frac{10 \text{ g}}{32 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.3125 \text{ mol} \]

For natural rubber (mer):
\[ \text{moles of mer} = \frac{50 \text{ g}}{68 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.7353 \text{ mol} \]

Since the mer to S ratio is 1:1 by weight, and we have assumed that this ratio also applies to the moles for the purpose of cross-linking, the number of moles of mer that can react with the available moles of sulfur is limited by the lesser of the two amounts. In this case, it is the moles of sulfur.

The maximum number of moles of mer that can react with sulfur is 0.3125 mol (the same as the moles of sulfur since the ratio is 1:1).

Now, to find the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites, we calculate the ratio of the actual moles of mer that can react to the total moles of mer present, and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

\[ \text{Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites} = \left( \frac{0.3125 \text{ mol}}{0.7353 \text{ mol}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites} \approx \left( \frac{3125}{7353} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites} \approx 42.48\% \]

If carbon (C) in iron (Fe) is 6 percent by weight, then its atomic percent is approximately  (A) 13 (B) 23 (C) 30 (D) 50"," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the atomic percent of carbon (C) in iron (Fe), given that carbon is 6 percent by weight in the iron-carbon alloy.

First, we need to understand that atomic percent is the percentage of atoms of one element in a compound or alloy relative to the total number of atoms. It is not the same as weight percent, which is based on the mass of each element.

Given that the atomic weight of carbon is 12 and the atomic weight of iron is 56, we can calculate the ratio of the number of atoms using their atomic weights.

Let's assume we have 100 grams of the iron-carbon alloy. If carbon is 6 percent by weight, then we have:

- Mass of carbon = 6 g
- Mass of iron = 100 g - 6 g = 94 g

Now, we convert the mass of each element to the number of moles:

- Moles of carbon = mass of carbon / atomic weight of carbon = 6 g / 12 g/mol = 0.5 mol
- Moles of iron = mass of iron / atomic weight of iron = 94 g / 56 g/mol ≈ 1.679 mol

Next, we calculate the ratio of the number of atoms (which will give us the atomic percent) by multiplying the moles by Avogadro's number (approximately 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol):

- Atoms of carbon = 0.5 mol * 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol ≈ 3.011 x 10^23 atoms
- Atoms of iron = 1.679 mol * 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol ≈ 1.008 x 10^24 atoms

Now, we calculate the atomic percent of carbon:

- Atomic percent of carbon = (Atoms of carbon / (Atoms of carbon + Atoms of iron)) * 100
- Atomic percent of carbon = (3.011 x 10^23 / (3.011 x 10^23 + 1.008 x 10^24)) * 100
- Atomic percent of carbon ≈ (3.011 / (3.011 + 10.08)) * 100
- Atomic percent of carbon ≈ (3.011 / 13.091) * 100
- Atomic percent of carbon ≈ 0.230 * 100

- Liquid phase sintering (Q) involves the formation of a liquid phase at the sintering temperature, which can facilitate the densification of the material. It is often used for materials that are difficult to sinter by solid-state sintering alone.

Material manufacturing,5,G-XEC-2019-12,MCQS,53,Which one of the following conditions will NOT favour the separation of impurities in zone refining process?  (A) Increase in the gap between solidus and liquidus lines (B) Increase in the solubility of impurities in solid as compared to that in liquid phase (C) Agitation of melt (D) Low cooling rate of melt," To answer the question, let's briefly review what zone refining is and how it works. Zone refining is a process used to purify materials, typically metals and semiconductors. It involves moving a molten zone along a solid material. As the molten zone moves, impurities tend to segregate into the liquid phase, away from the solid phase, due to the difference in solubility of the impurities in the solid and liquid states.

Now, let's analyze the given options:

(A) Increase in the gap between solidus and liquidus lines - A larger gap between the solidus and liquidus lines means there is a wider range of temperatures over which the material can be partially solid and partially liquid. This typically allows for better segregation of impurities, as there is more opportunity for impurities to move into the liquid phase.

(B) Increase in the solubility of impurities in solid as compared to that in liquid phase - If impurities are more soluble in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, they will tend to stay in the solid as the molten zone passes, which is contrary to the goal of zone refining. Therefore, this condition would not favor the separation of impurities.

(C) Agitation of melt - Agitation of the melt can help in distributing the heat and impurities more uniformly, which can enhance the separation of impurities into the liquid phase. However, excessive agitation might also remix some of the impurities back into the solid phase, but generally, controlled agitation is considered beneficial.

(D) Low cooling rate of melt - A low cooling rate allows more time for impurities to diffuse from the solidifying material into the liquid phase, which favors the separation of impurities. A high cooling rate would be detrimental as it would freeze the impurities into the solid matrix before they have a chance to segregate into the liquid.

Statement-1: Sintering in vacuum leads to improved densification as compared to sintering under ambient (at atmospheric pressure) condition. Statement-2: Closed pores formed during sintering inhibit full densification.   (A)	Both Statement-1 and Statement-2 are FALSE. (B)	Both statement-1 and Statement-2 are TRUE.  (C)	Statement-1 is TRUE but Statement -2 is FALSE.  (D)	Statement-1 is FALSE but Statement-2 is TRUE. ," To answer the question, let's analyze each statement separately:

Statement-1: Sintering in vacuum leads to improved densification as compared to sintering under ambient (at atmospheric pressure) condition.
This statement is generally TRUE. Sintering in a vacuum typically leads to better densification because it reduces the presence of gases that can be trapped in the material, which would otherwise impede the movement of atoms and the closing of pores. The absence of air also allows for cleaner surfaces to bond together more effectively.

Statement-2: Closed pores formed during sintering inhibit full densification.
This statement is also TRUE. Closed pores within a sintered material can prevent full densification because they are isolated from the material's surface and the atmosphere. These pores do not allow for the escape of gases or vapors that may be generated during sintering, which can lead to increased internal pressure and hinder the material's ability to densify fully.

Given that both statements are true, the correct answer is:

Let P(n) denote the probability that there will be no accident over a period of ‘n’ months. Assume that the events of individual months are independent of each other. The smallest integer value of ‘n’ such that P(n) ≤ ½ is? (round off to the nearest integer) "," To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that the probability of no accident occurring over a period of 'n' months is less than or equal to 1/2.

Given that the probability of an accident occurring in a given month is 1/100, the probability of no accident occurring in a given month is 1 - 1/100 = 99/100.

Let P(n) denote the probability that there will be no accident over a period of 'n' months. Since the events are independent, we can calculate P(n) by multiplying the probability of no accident for each month together:

P(n) = (99/100)^n

We want to find the smallest 'n' such that P(n) ≤ 1/2:

(99/100)^n ≤ 1/2

To solve for 'n', we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln((99/100)^n) ≤ ln(1/2)

Using the power rule for logarithms, we get:

n * ln(99/100) ≤ ln(1/2)

Now we can solve for 'n':

n ≥ ln(1/2) / ln(99/100)

Using the property of logarithms that ln(1/a) = -ln(a), we get:

n ≥ -ln(2) / ln(99/100)

Now we can calculate the value of 'n':

n ≥ -ln(2) / ln(0.99)

Using a calculator, we find:

n ≥ -ln(2) / ln(0.99) ≈ 68.97

Since we are looking for the smallest integer value of 'n', we need to round up to the nearest integer because we can't have a fraction of a month in this context. Therefore, the smallest integer value of 'n' is 69.

Material manufacturing,9,G-XEC-2021-21,NUM,52,"A certain ceramic has a theoretical density and sintered density of 6.76 $gcm^(−3)$ and 6.60 g $cm^(−3)$ , respectively. The green compact has 18 volume percent porosity. For a sintered cube of side 2 cm, the required side of the cubic green compact in cm is? (round off to 2 decimal places) "," To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between theoretical density, sintered density, and porosity.

Theoretical density (ρ_theoretical) is the density of the material without any porosity. Sintered density (ρ_sintered) is the actual density of the material after it has been sintered, which may include some porosity. The green compact density (ρ_green) can be calculated from the sintered density and the volume percent porosity of the green compact.

The volume percent porosity of the green compact is given as 18%. This means that 18% of the green compact's volume is empty space (pores). Therefore, the material in the green compact only occupies 82% of its volume.

We can relate the sintered density to the green compact density by considering that the mass of the material does not change during sintering (ignoring any mass loss due to processes like burnout of organic binders, which is not mentioned in the problem). Thus, the mass of the sintered cube (M_sintered) is equal to the mass of the green compact (M_green).

The mass of the sintered cube can be calculated using its sintered density and volume:

M_sintered = ρ_sintered * V_sintered

Since the side of the sintered cube (s_sintered) is 2 cm, its volume (V_sintered) is:

V_sintered = s_sintered^3 = 2^3 = 8 cm^3

Now, we can calculate the mass of the sintered cube:

M_sintered = 6.60 g/cm^3 * 8 cm^3 = 52.8 g

This mass is the same for the green compact, so we can calculate the volume of the green compact (V_green) using its density (ρ_green):

M_green = ρ_green * V_green

We need to find ρ_green, which we can calculate from the sintered density and the porosity of the green compact:

ρ_green = ρ_sintered / (1 - porosity)

where porosity is in decimal form (18% = 0.18):

ρ_green = 6.60 g/cm^3 / (1 - 0.18) = 6.60 g/cm^3 / 0.82 ≈ 8.05 g/cm^3

Now we can find the volume of the green compact:

V_green = M_green / ρ_green = 52.8 g / 8.05 g/cm^3 ≈ 6.56 cm^3

The volume of a cube is equal to the cube of its side length, so for the green compact:

V_green = s_green^3

6.56 cm^3 = s_green^3

To find the side length of the green compact (s_green), we take the cube root of the volume:

s_green = ∛(6.56 cm^3) ≈ 1.87 cm

Rounded to two decimal places, the required side of the cubic green compact is approximately 1.87 cm.

Here is the final answer in a list:

- The required side of the cubic green compact is approximately 1.87 cm.",,,0,

Heat loss from the liquid metal takes place by  (A) Radiation only (B) Radiation and conduction only (C) Radiation and convection only (D) Radiation, conduction and convection"," The correct answer to the question is:

(D) Radiation, conduction, and convection

Explanation:

- **Radiation**: Hot metal will emit thermal radiation because all objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit electromagnetic radiation. This is a significant mode of heat transfer at high temperatures, such as 1700 K.

- **Conduction**: The metal is in direct contact with the sand mould, so heat will be conducted from the hot metal to the cooler sand.

- **Convection**: Since the mould is open at the top, the hot metal will heat the air above it, causing the air to become less dense and rise, which will set up a convection current. This will carry heat away from the metal surface.

Therefore, all three modes of heat transfer are involved when hot metal is poured into a sand mould that is open at the top.

Material manufacturing,13,G-META-12-13,MCQS,20,During LD blow in steelmaking the impurity that gets removed first is  (A) Carbon (B) Phosphorous (C) Manganese (D) Silicon," The process of steelmaking involves various stages, and one of the key stages is the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) process, also known as the LD process (after the Linz-Donawitz steelmaking route). During this process, impurities are removed from the molten iron to produce steel.

The order of removal of impurities in the BOF process is primarily determined by their reactivity with oxygen and their boiling points. Here's a brief overview of the removal of the given impurities:

1. **Carbon (C)**: Carbon is removed as carbon monoxide (CO) when oxygen is blown into the molten iron. The reaction is exothermic and raises the temperature of the bath, which helps in the removal of other impurities.

2. **Silicon (Si)**: Silicon is an deoxidizer and reacts with oxygen to form silicon dioxide (SiO2), which floats to the top of the molten steel as slag. It is removed relatively early in the process.

3. **Manganese (Mn)**: Manganese is also oxidized and removed as slag, but it has a higher affinity for oxygen than silicon, so it is removed after silicon.

4. **Phosphorus (P)**: Phosphorus is removed by oxidation to form phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), which then reacts with the basic slag to form a phosphate compound that can be removed. Phosphorus removal is more difficult than that of silicon and manganese, so it is typically removed later in the process.

Given this information, the impurity that gets removed first during the LD blow in steelmaking is:

Answer:
- [ ] A) Carbon
- [ ] B) Phosphorous
- [ ] C) Manganese
- [X] D) Silicon

Silicon is the correct answer. It is removed before carbon, manganese, and phosphorus due to its high reactivity with oxygen and the formation of slag that can be easily separated from the molten steel.",,,0,

(A) Before casting solidifies

Risers are designed to solidify before the casting itself to ensure that there is enough molten metal to feed the casting as it solidifies and shrinks. This helps prevent defects such as shrinkage porosity in the casting. As the casting cools and solidifies, the riser acts as a reservoir of molten metal that compensates for the shrinkage that occurs during solidification. Once the casting has solidified, the riser can be removed, and the metal from the riser can be reused.

The value of $C_S$ at 1900 K is  (A) 0.0009 (B) 0.009 (C) 0.09 (D) 0.9"," To solve for the sulphide capacity ($C_S$) of the liquid slag at 1900 K, we need to calculate the mole fraction of each component and then apply the given equation.

First, we need to convert the weight percentages to moles and then calculate the mole fractions. We will assume that the total weight of the slag is 100 grams for simplicity.

Given atomic weights:
- Ca: 40 g/mol
- Mg: 24 g/mol
- Si: 28 g/mol
- Al: 27 g/mol
- O: 16 g/mol

Given weight percentages:
- CaO: 55 wt.%
- SiO2: 20 wt.%
- Al2O3: 15 wt.%
- MgO: 10 wt.%

Now, let's calculate the moles of each component:
- Moles of CaO = 55 g / (40 g/mol + 16 g/mol) = 55 g / 56 g/mol = 0.9821 mol
- Moles of SiO2 = 20 g / (28 g/mol + 2*16 g/mol) = 20 g / 60 g/mol = 0.3333 mol
- Moles of Al2O3 = 15 g / (2*27 g/mol + 3*16 g/mol) = 15 g / 102 g/mol = 0.1471 mol
- Moles of MgO = 10 g / (24 g/mol + 16 g/mol) = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol

Total moles in the slag:
- Total moles = 0.9821 + 0.3333 + 0.1471 + 0.25 = 1.7125 mol

Now, we calculate the mole fractions (X):
- $X_{CaO}$ = 0.9821 / 1.7125 = 0.5734
- $X_{SiO2}$ = 0.3333 / 1.7125 = 0.1946
- $X_{Al2O3}$ = 0.1471 / 1.7125 = 0.0860
- $X_{MgO}$ = 0.25 / 1.7125 = 0.1460

Next, we apply the given equation for $C_S$:
log $C_S$ = 3.44 * [$X_{CaO}$ + 0.1 * $X_{MgO}$ - 0.8 * $X_{Al2O3}$ - $X_{SiO2}$] - (9894 / T) + 2.05

Plugging in the mole fractions and T = 1900 K:
log $C_S$ = 3.44 * [0.5734 + 0.1 * 0.1460 - 0.8 * 0.0860 - 0.1946] - (9894 / 1900) + 2.05

Calculating the terms inside the brackets:
log $C_S$ = 3.44 * [0.5734 + 0.0146 - 0.0688 - 0.1946] - 5.2074 + 2.05

Quenching is a process of rapidly cooling a material (often a metal) to obtain certain material properties, such as hardness. The severity of the quench is determined by the rate at which the material is cooled, which is influenced by the quenching medium used.

Here are the quenching methods listed from least severe to most severe based on their cooling rates:

1. **Oil quenching (P)**: Oil has a relatively slow cooling rate compared to water and brine. It is less severe and is used when a slower quench is desired to reduce the risk of cracking or distortion.

2. **Water quenching (Q)**: Water has a higher thermal conductivity than oil, which results in a faster cooling rate. It is more severe than oil quenching and can lead to greater thermal stresses and potential for distortion or cracking.

3. **Water quenching with agitation (R)**: Agitating the water increases its cooling efficiency by continuously bringing cooler water into contact with the hot material. This increases the severity of the quench compared to still water.

4. **Brine quenching (S)**: Brine, which is a solution of water and salt, has an even higher cooling rate than plain water due to the salt's effect on the water's specific heat and thermal conductivity. Brine quenching is the most severe of the methods listed and can lead to the highest risk of thermal shock and cracking.

Arranging these methods from least severe to most severe, we get:

High top pressure in a blast furnace operation suppresses the solution-loss reaction. The solution-loss reaction refers to the process where the solid burden in the furnace is reduced, which is not desirable as it can lead to inefficient furnace operation and increased coke consumption. Higher pressure at the top of the blast furnace helps to maintain a stable gas flow and reduces the propensity for the solution-loss reaction to occur, thus improving the overall efficiency of the furnace.

(C) oxidizing and basic

In the L-D (Linz-Donawitz) process, also known as the basic oxygen steelmaking process, the final slag is both oxidizing and basic. The slag is basic due to the presence of basic oxides such as calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO), which are introduced into the process through the addition of lime (CaO) or dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). These basic components help in removing acidic impurities like silica (SiO2) and phosphorus (P) from the steel.

The slag is also oxidizing because it contains oxidized elements such as iron oxide (FeO), which help in the removal of carbon and other impurities from the molten steel through oxidation reactions. The oxygen blown into the molten bath during the L-D process promotes these oxidizing conditions.

Therefore, the final slag in L-D steelmaking is both oxidizing due to its role in deoxidizing the steel and basic due to its composition.

First, let's determine the number of gearwheels that are below and above the required tolerance:

- Below tolerance: 21 gearwheels
- Above tolerance: 150 - 112 (within tolerance) - 21 (below tolerance) = 17 gearwheels

Now, let's calculate the probability of each event:

1. The probability of selecting a gearwheel below the tolerance on the first draw is:
   P(below on first draw) = Number of below tolerance gearwheels / Total number of gearwheels
   P(below on first draw) = 21 / 150

2. After selecting a gearwheel below the tolerance, there are now 149 gearwheels left. The probability of selecting a gearwheel above the tolerance on the second draw is:
   P(above on second draw after below on first draw) = Number of above tolerance gearwheels / Remaining number of gearwheels
   P(above on second draw after below on first draw) = 17 / 149

The combined probability of both events happening in sequence (without replacement) is the product of the two probabilities:
   P(below then above) = P(below on first draw) * P(above on second draw after below on first draw)
   P(below then above) = (21 / 150) * (17 / 149)

Now, let's calculate the combined probability:
   P(below then above) = (21 / 150) * (17 / 149)
   P(below then above) = (1 / 150) * (21 * 17)
   P(below then above) = (1 / 150) * (357)
   P(below then above) = 357 / (150 * 149)

Here's a brief explanation of each unit operation and its corresponding principle:

1. Jigging (P): This is a gravity separation process where the ore is subjected to a pulsating water stream, causing particles to stratify based on density and size. The principle behind jigging is the differential acceleration given to particles due to the pulsation of the fluid, which allows for separation based on specific gravity.

2. Tabling (Q): Tabling, also known as shaking tables, uses a slanted table surface that is shaken back and forth. The differential lateral movement of particles across the table surface is caused by the combined effect of gravity, table movement, and water flow, which separates particles based on size, shape, and density.

3. Heavy media separation (R): In heavy media separation, a medium with a density between the densities of the valuable and gangue minerals is used. Particles are separated based on their density relative to the medium; those with a higher density sink, while those with a lower density float.

4. Flotation (S): Flotation is a process that uses the modification of surface tension to separate minerals. Chemicals are added to the ore slurry to change the surface properties of the mineral particles, making some hydrophobic (water-repellent) and others hydrophilic (water-attracting). Air bubbles are then introduced, and the hydrophobic particles attach to the bubbles and float to the surface, while the hydrophilic particles remain in the water.

Based on these explanations, we can match the unit operations with their principles as follows:

- P (Jigging) corresponds to (3) Differential initial acceleration.
- Q (Tabling) corresponds to (4) Differential lateral movement.
- R (Heavy media separation) corresponds to (2) Difference in density.
- S (Flotation) corresponds to (1) Modification of surface tension.

Assertion: For the extraction of metal values from their sulphide concentrates by hydrometallurgical route, leaching with oxygen under high pressure is used. Reason: Presence of oxygen under high pressure causes roasting of sulphides, which helps in leaching of the values.  (A) a is true but r is false (B) a is false but r is true (C) both a and r are true, and r is the reason for a (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a"," To answer this question, let's analyze both the Assertion (a) and the Reason (r) separately and then together.

Assertion (a): For the extraction of metal values from their sulphide concentrates by hydrometallurgical route, leaching with oxygen under high pressure is used.

This statement is true. The process described is known as pressure oxidation or autoclave leaching. It is a hydrometallurgical process used to extract metals from their sulfide ores. In this process, the ore is leached with oxygen under high pressure and temperature, which converts sulfide minerals into soluble sulfates or other compounds that can be leached out, thus releasing the metal values.

Reason (r): Presence of oxygen under high pressure causes roasting of sulphides, which helps in leaching of the values.

This statement is somewhat misleading. While it is true that the presence of oxygen under high pressure is crucial for the leaching process, the term ""roasting"" typically refers to a thermal treatment process in air at temperatures below the melting point of the metal, which is a pyrometallurgical process, not a hydrometallurgical one. However, the high-pressure oxygen does oxidize the sulfides, which aids in the leaching process by converting them into more soluble forms. So, the essence of the reason is true in that oxygen under high pressure oxidizes the sulfides, but the use of the term ""roasting"" could be misinterpreted as referring to a different process.

Given the analysis:

- Assertion (a) is true.
- Reason (r) is true in essence but could be misinterpreted due to the use of the term ""roasting.""

Now, considering the relationship between the Assertion and the Reason:

- The reason correctly explains the mechanism behind the assertion, as the presence of oxygen under high pressure is indeed what facilitates the leaching of metal values from sulfide concentrates in the hydrometallurgical process.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) both a and r are true, and r is the reason for a

Even though the term ""roasting"" might be better replaced with ""oxidation"" to avoid confusion with pyrometallurgical processes, the underlying scientific principle behind the reason is sound and does explain why the assertion is true.

Assertion (a): Deoxidation and decarburisation of liquid steel are done by vacuum treatment process.
This assertion is true. Vacuum treatment processes, such as vacuum degassing, are used in the steelmaking industry to remove dissolved gases like oxygen and hydrogen, as well as to reduce the carbon content in liquid steel. By lowering the pressure, the solubility of gases in the steel is reduced, which facilitates their removal.

Reason (r): Decreased partial pressure of CO(g) promotes deoxidation and decarburisation.
This reason is also true. The partial pressure of a gas above a liquid influences the equilibrium concentration of that gas in the liquid according to Henry's Law. By decreasing the partial pressure of CO(g) in the surrounding environment (as achieved in a vacuum), the equilibrium shifts to promote the removal of carbon and oxygen from the liquid steel. This is because the lower partial pressure of CO(g) favors the formation of CO gas from the carbon and oxygen dissolved in the steel, thus enhancing the processes of deoxidation and decarburisation.

Now, let's consider the relationship between the assertion and the reason:

- The vacuum treatment process indeed promotes deoxidation and decarburisation of liquid steel.
- The decreased partial pressure of CO(g) in a vacuum is a key factor that promotes these processes.

Material manufacturing,28,G-META-14-40,NUM,36,"In a sand casting of a rectangular slab, the thickness of the solidified layer after 2 minutes is known to be 3 cm. Based on Chvorinov's rule, the solidified thickness (in cm) after 4 minutes is?"," Chvorinov's rule, also known as the Chvorinov's criterion or Chvorinov's law, is used to predict the time required for a casting to solidify. It states that the solidification time of a casting is proportional to the square of its volume and inversely proportional to the surface area through which heat is dissipated. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ t = B \times \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^2 \]

where:
- \( t \) is the solidification time,
- \( B \) is a constant that depends on the material properties and the initial temperature difference,
- \( V \) is the volume of the casting, and
- \( A \) is the surface area of the casting.

For a rectangular slab, the volume \( V \) is proportional to the thickness \( T \), and the surface area \( A \) is proportional to the width and length but not the thickness (since we are considering the solidified layer growing inward from the surfaces in contact with the mold). Therefore, if the thickness of the solidified layer doubles, the volume of the solidified portion will also double, while the surface area through which heat is dissipated remains approximately constant (assuming the width and length of the slab are much larger than the thickness).

Given that the thickness of the solidified layer is 3 cm after 2 minutes, we can use Chvorinov's rule to find the thickness after 4 minutes. Since the time has doubled (from 2 to 4 minutes), and the volume is proportional to the thickness, the thickness of the solidified layer should also double if the surface area remains constant:

\[ t_1 = 2 \text{ minutes}, \quad T_1 = 3 \text{ cm} \]
\[ t_2 = 4 \text{ minutes}, \quad T_2 = \, ? \]

Using the proportionality from Chvorinov's rule:

\[ \frac{t_2}{t_1} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = \left(\frac{T_2}{3}\right)^2 \]

\[ 2 = \left(\frac{T_2}{3}\right)^2 \]

\[ \sqrt{2} = \frac{T_2}{3} \]

\[ T_2 = 3 \times \sqrt{2} \]

\[ T_2 \approx 3 \times 1.414 \]

\[ T_2 \approx 4.242 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, the solidified thickness after 4 minutes is approximately 4.242 cm.

(C) $P_(2)O_(5)$

Explanation:

In silicate slags, the addition of certain oxides can lead to polymerization, which is the formation of a three-dimensional network of silicon-oxygen (Si-O) bonds. This network formation typically involves the creation of bridging oxygens that connect silicon tetrahedra.

- (A) CaO (calcium oxide) and (B) MgO (magnesium oxide) are basic oxides that act as network modifiers. They break up the silicate network by converting bridging oxygens into non-bridging oxygens, which reduces the degree of polymerization.

- (D) $Na_(2)O$ (sodium oxide) is also a network modifier. It introduces alkali ions that can disrupt the silicate network by charging balancing non-bridging oxygens, thus reducing viscosity and the tendency for network formation.

- (C) $P_(2)O_(5)$ (phosphorus pentoxide) is an acidic oxide that can act as a network former. It can polymerize with the silicate network by sharing oxygen atoms to form phosphorus-oxygen-silicon (P-O-Si) bonds, which can lead to the formation of a more complex and cross-linked network structure. This results in an increase in the viscosity of the slag and promotes the formation of a glassy phase upon cooling.

(A) Electrodeposition: This is a process where metal ions in a solution are deposited onto a conductive surface to form a metal coating. Electrodeposition can produce very fine-grained metals because the grain size can be controlled by the deposition parameters.

(B) Czochralski method: This method is primarily used for growing single crystals of semiconductors, metals, salts, and synthetic gemstones. It is not typically used for producing fine-grained metals but rather large, single-crystal structures.

(C) Equi-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP): ECAP is a severe plastic deformation process that can significantly refine the grain size of metals. It is specifically designed to produce ultra-fine grained or nanocrystalline materials.

(D) Sintering of milled powders: Sintering is a method used to create objects from powders. When fine metal powders are milled and then sintered, the resulting material can have a very fine grain structure due to the small size of the starting particles.

The iron ore charged into the furnace contains 95% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ and the rest is gangue. Assume that all the iron in the ore goes to hot metal. The amount of iron ore (in kg) required for producing 1000 kg of hot metal is ?," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of iron ore required to produce 1000 kg of hot metal containing 95% Fe.

First, let's find out how much pure iron (Fe) is in 1000 kg of hot metal:

- The hot metal is 95% Fe, so the mass of Fe in the hot metal is:
  1000 kg * 0.95 = 950 kg of Fe

Now, we need to determine how much Fe is in the iron ore. The iron ore contains 95% Fe2O3, so we need to calculate the mass of Fe2O3 that contains the required amount of Fe:

- The molar mass of Fe is 56 g/mol, and the molar mass of Fe2O3 is 160 g/mol.
- In Fe2O3, the mass of Fe per mole is 2 * 56 g = 112 g.
- The mass percentage of Fe in Fe2O3 is (2 * 56 g) / (160 g) * 100 = 112 g / 160 g * 100 = 70%.

Now, we calculate the mass of Fe2O3 required to get 950 kg of Fe:

- Since 70% of Fe2O3 is Fe, we divide the mass of Fe needed by the mass percentage of Fe in Fe2O3:
  950 kg / 0.70 = 1357.14 kg of Fe2O3

Finally, we need to account for the fact that the iron ore is not pure Fe2O3; it contains 5% gangue. Therefore, we need to divide the mass of pure Fe2O3 by the mass percentage of Fe2O3 in the ore:

- The mass of iron ore required is:
  1357.14 kg / 0.95 = 1428.57 kg

So, the amount of iron ore required for producing 1000 kg of hot metal is 1428.57 kg.

If mould length ($L_m$) is 0.8 m and casting speed ($U_c$) is 0.2 $m.s^(-1)$, the average mould flux (in MW.$m^(-2)$) is?"," To find the average mould heat flux ($q_{m,avg}$) over the mould length ($L_m$), we need to integrate the heat flux function over the length of the mould and then divide by the mould length. The heat flux as a function of distance below the meniscus ($z$) is given by:

\[ q_m(z) = \left[2.67 - 0.33\left(\frac{z}{U_c}\right)^{0.5}\right] \times 10^6 \text{ W/m}^2 \]

Given that the mould length ($L_m$) is 0.8 m and the casting speed ($U_c$) is 0.2 m/s, we can proceed with the calculation.

The average heat flux is calculated by:

\[ q_{m,avg} = \frac{1}{L_m} \int_0^{L_m} q_m(z) \, dz \]

Substituting the given heat flux function into the integral, we get:

\[ q_{m,avg} = \frac{1}{L_m} \int_0^{L_m} \left[2.67 - 0.33\left(\frac{z}{U_c}\right)^{0.5}\right] \times 10^6 \, dz \]

\[ q_{m,avg} = \frac{10^6}{L_m} \int_0^{L_m} \left[2.67 - 0.33\left(\frac{z}{0.2}\right)^{0.5}\right] \, dz \]

\[ q_{m,avg} = \frac{10^6}{0.8} \int_0^{0.8} \left[2.67 - 0.33\left(\frac{z}{0.2}\right)^{0.5}\right] \, dz \]

Now, let's solve the integral:

\[ q_{m,avg} = \frac{10^6}{0.8} \left[ \int_0^{0.8} 2.67 \, dz - \int_0^{0.8} 0.33\left(\frac{z}{0.2}\right)^{0.5} \, dz \right] \]

\[ q_{m,avg} = \frac{10^6}{0.8} \left[ 2.67z \Big|_0^{0.8} - 0.33 \int_0^{0.8} \left(\frac{z}{0.2}\right)^{0.5} \, dz \right] \]

Let's solve the second integral separately:

\[ \int_0^{0.8} \left(\frac{z}{0.2}\right)^{0.5} \, dz = \int_0^{0.8} \left(\frac{1}{0.2}\right)^{0.5} z^{0.5} \, dz \]

\[ = \left(\frac{1}{0.2}\right)^{0.5} \int_0^{0.8} z^{0.5} \, dz \]

\[ = \left(\frac{1}{0.2}\right)^{0.5} \left[ \frac{2}{3} z^{1.5} \Big|_0^{0.8} \right] \]

\[ = \left(\frac{1}{0.2}\right)^{0.5} \left[ \frac{2}{3} (0.8)^{1.5} - \frac{2}{3} (0)^{1.5} \right] \]

\[ = \left(\frac{1}{0.2}\right)^{0.5} \left[ \frac{2}{3} (0.8)^{1.5} \right] \]

Material manufacturing,43,G-META-16-39,NUM,49,"In BOF steelmaking, 5 metric ton of lime containing 90 wt.% CaO is used to refine 100 metric ton of hot metal containing 93.2 wt.% Fe. The slag produced during refining contains 40 wt.% CaO and 22 wt.% FeO. Neglecting material losses, the yield of Fe (in %) is?"," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the yield of Fe from the hot metal after the refining process in the BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) steelmaking process. The yield of Fe is the amount of Fe in the product (steel) divided by the amount of Fe in the hot metal, expressed as a percentage.

First, we need to determine the amount of CaO and Fe in the lime and hot metal, respectively:

1. Lime:
   - Mass of lime = 5 metric tons
   - CaO content in lime = 90 wt.%
   - Mass of CaO in lime = 5 metric tons * 90% = 4.5 metric tons

2. Hot metal:
   - Mass of hot metal = 100 metric tons
   - Fe content in hot metal = 93.2 wt.%
   - Mass of Fe in hot metal = 100 metric tons * 93.2% = 93.2 metric tons

Next, we need to consider the slag composition:

3. Slag:
   - Mass of slag is not given directly, but we know the slag contains 40 wt.% CaO and 22 wt.% FeO.
   - Since the slag is the only other product besides steel, and we have the mass of CaO that went into the process, we can use the CaO content in the slag to find the mass of the slag.
   - Mass of CaO in slag = Mass of CaO from lime = 4.5 metric tons
   - Since the slag is 40% CaO, we can calculate the total mass of the slag:
     - Total mass of slag = Mass of CaO in slag / CaO content in slag
     - Total mass of slag = 4.5 metric tons / 40% = 11.25 metric tons

Now, we can calculate the mass of FeO in the slag:

4. Mass of FeO in slag = FeO content in slag * total mass of slag
   - Mass of FeO in slag = 22% * 11.25 metric tons = 2.475 metric tons

Since FeO is formed from the oxidation of Fe in the hot metal, the mass of Fe that has been converted to FeO is:

5. Mass of Fe converted to FeO = Mass of FeO in slag / (FeO content in slag / Fe content in FeO)
   - FeO is 78.3% Fe, so Fe content in FeO = 78.3%
   - Mass of Fe converted to FeO = 2.475 metric tons / 78.3% = 3.16 metric tons

Now, we can calculate the mass of Fe that remains after refining:

6. Mass of Fe remaining = Mass of Fe in hot metal - Mass of Fe converted to FeO
   - Mass of Fe remaining = 93.2 metric tons - 3.16 metric tons = 90.04 metric tons

Finally, the yield of Fe is calculated as:

7. Yield of Fe (%) = (Mass of Fe remaining / Mass of Fe in hot metal) * 100
   - Yield of Fe (%) = (90.04 metric tons / 93.2 metric tons) * 100

Now, let's calculate the exact value:

Yield of Fe (%) = (90.04 / 93.2) * 100 ≈ 96.6%

The yield of Fe is approximately 96.6%. Here is the answer in a list as requested:

Material manufacturing,44,G-META-17-37,NUM,78,"In primary steelmaking, dissolved oxygen(O) reacts with carbon (C) to produce CO(g), at 1atm pressure according to the reaction: C + O = CO(g). The equilibrium constant for this reaction is: logK = (1160/T) + 2.003, where T is in Kelvin. Assuming Henrian activity coefficient of both O and C to be unity, the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of a plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600° C is?(answer up tp four decimal places)"," To solve for the dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt, we need to use the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:

\[ C + O = CO(g) \]

The equilibrium constant \( K \) for this reaction is given by:

\[ K = \frac{P_{CO}}{a_C \cdot a_O} \]

where \( P_{CO} \) is the partial pressure of CO (which is 1 atm in this case since it's the only gas and the total pressure is 1 atm), and \( a_C \) and \( a_O \) are the activities of carbon and oxygen, respectively. Since the activity coefficients are assumed to be unity, the activities are equal to the concentrations.

Given that the equilibrium constant \( K \) is expressed as:

\[ \log K = \frac{1160}{T} + 2.003 \]

First, we need to convert the temperature from degrees Celsius to Kelvin:

\[ T = 1600°C + 273.15 = 1873.15 K \]

Now we can calculate \( \log K \):

\[ \log K = \frac{1160}{1873.15} + 2.003 \]

\[ \log K \approx 0.6187 + 2.003 \]

\[ \log K \approx 2.6217 \]

\[ K \approx 10^{2.6217} \]

\[ K \approx 419.47 \]


Now, let's express the equilibrium constant in terms of the concentrations of C and O:

\[ K = \frac{P_{CO}}{a_C \cdot a_O} = \frac{1}{[C] \cdot [O]} \]

Given that \( [C] = 0.7 \) wt.%, we can solve for \( [O] \):

\[ [O] = \frac{1}{K \cdot [C]} \]

\[ [O] = \frac{1}{419.47 \cdot 0.007} \]

\[ [O] \approx \frac{1}{2.936299} \]

\[ [O] \approx 0.340463 \text{ wt.\%} \]

Now, let's round the result to four decimal places:

\[ [O] \approx 0.3405 \text{ wt.\%} \]

So the dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt is approximately 0.3405 wt.%.

2. **Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF)**: The pig iron from the blast furnace is then charged into the BOF, where it is converted into steel. Oxygen is blown into the molten pig iron to lower the carbon content and remove other impurities.

3. **Ladle Furnace Process (LF)**: After the BOF process, the steel is transferred to a ladle furnace where it can be further refined and alloying elements can be added to achieve the desired chemical composition.

(A) 0.06 (B) 0.002 (C) 0.02 (D) 0.0002","  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the partial pressure of CO and the equilibrium constant K for the decarburization reaction in a steel bath. The reaction for decarburization can be represented as:

\[ C(s) + O(s) \rightleftharpoons CO(g) \]

According to the context provided, the equilibrium constant K for the dissolved carbon and oxygen in the steel bath at 1550 °C is given by:

\[ K = (wt.\%C)(wt.\%O) \]

When the partial pressure of CO (\( p_{CO} \)) is 1 atm, K is 0.002. According to Henry's Law, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid. Since the reaction for the formation of CO is an equilibrium, we can assume that the concentration of CO in the gas phase is proportional to its partial pressure. Therefore, if the partial pressure of CO changes, the equilibrium concentrations of C and O in the steel bath will also change to maintain the equilibrium constant.

The relationship between the equilibrium constant and the partial pressure of CO can be expressed as:

\[ K \propto p_{CO} \]

or

\[ K = k \cdot p_{CO} \]

where k is a proportionality constant. Since we know K at \( p_{CO} = 1 \) atm, we can find k:

\[ k = \frac{K}{p_{CO}} = \frac{0.002}{1} = 0.002 \]

Now, we want to find the new value of K when \( p_{CO} = 0.1 \) atm. Using the proportionality constant k, we have:

\[ K' = k \cdot p'_{CO} \]
\[ K' = 0.002 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ K' = 0.0002 \]

Therefore, the value of K when \( p_{CO} = 0.1 \) atm is 0.0002.

(A) The lower atomic weight element is leached (B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached (C) The more electronegative element is leached (D) The element with lower density is leached," Selective leaching, also known as dealloying, is a process where one element of a binary alloy is preferentially removed, typically through a corrosion process. The driving force behind selective leaching can be influenced by several factors, including the electrochemical properties of the elements involved, their relative positions in the electrochemical series, and their reactivity with the environment.

Given the options provided:

(A) The lower atomic weight element is leached - This is not necessarily true. Selective leaching is more about the electrochemical potential and reactivity rather than atomic weight.

(B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached - Higher diffusivity can influence the rate at which an element is leached, but it is not the sole determining factor. The electrochemical potential is more critical.

(C) The more electronegative element is leached - Electronegativity can play a role in that the more electronegative element might be less likely to be oxidized and thus less likely to be leached. Instead, the less noble (less electronegative) element is typically the one that is leached.

(D) The element with lower density is leached - Density does not directly influence selective leaching. The process is governed by electrochemical reactions rather than physical properties like density.

Based on these considerations, none of the options (A), (B), (D) are definitively true. Option (C) is the closest to being correct, but it is stated in the opposite sense.

(A) Oil> Water> Brine> Air (B) Brine> Oil> Water> Air (C) Brine> Water> Oil> Air (D) Water> Brine> Oil> Air," The quenching power of different quenchants used in the heat treatment of steels is determined by their ability to remove heat from the steel quickly, which is influenced by factors such as specific heat, thermal conductivity, and the heat transfer coefficient between the quenchant and the steel surface.

Here is a general ranking of quenching power from highest to lowest:

1. **Brine (saltwater)**: Has the highest quenching power due to its high thermal conductivity and the exothermic reaction that occurs when water contacts the hot steel, which increases the cooling rate.
2. **Water**: Has a high quenching power, but less than brine because it lacks the additional thermal effects provided by the dissolved salts in brine.
3. **Oil**: Has a lower quenching power than water and brine because it has a lower specific heat and thermal conductivity, leading to slower cooling rates.
4. **Air**: Has the lowest quenching power among these options because it is a gas and has much lower thermal conductivity compared to liquids, resulting in the slowest cooling rate.

(A) Silicon (B) Carbon (C) Manganese (D) Phosphorus," In the basic oxygen steelmaking process, the element that oxidizes first is typically the one with the highest affinity for oxygen under the basic conditions of the process. The basic oxygen furnace (BOF) operates at high temperatures and uses pure oxygen to lower the carbon content in molten pig iron, turning it into steel.

The order of oxidation in a basic oxygen furnace generally follows this sequence:

1. Silicon (Si) is usually the first to oxidize because it has a high affinity for oxygen and forms silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is then combined with calcium oxide (CaO) from the basic lining of the furnace to form slag.
2. Manganese (Mn) is next, oxidizing to manganese dioxide (MnO2), which also enters the slag.
3. Carbon (C) is the primary element to be oxidized in the process, as the main goal is to reduce the carbon content to produce steel. However, it typically oxidizes after silicon and manganese.

A blast furnace uses hematite ore with 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. It uses 600 kg coke per ton of hot metal. The coke contains 85% C and 15%ash. The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5%C. The weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal respectively, are: (Assume that the gangue materials of the ore and ash content of coke form slag while $Fe_(2)O_3$ in the ore is consumed in making hot metal)  (A) 1705 kg, 431 kg (B) 2131kg, 546 kg (C) 1705kg, 331kg (D) 1500kg, 431kg"," To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of calculations based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the weight of iron ore used per ton of hot metal:**

We know that the hot metal is 95.5% Fe by weight. Since the atomic weight of Fe is 56, the weight of iron (Fe) in one ton (1000 kg) of hot metal is:

\[ \text{Weight of Fe in hot metal} = 1000 \text{ kg} \times 0.955 \]

Now, to find out how much $Fe_2O_3$ is needed to produce this amount of Fe, we need to consider the molecular weights of $Fe_2O_3$ and Fe:

\[ \text{Molecular weight of } Fe_2O_3 = 2 \times 56 + 3 \times 16 = 112 + 48 = 160 \]
\[ \text{Molecular weight of Fe} = 56 \]

The weight of $Fe_2O_3$ needed is then:

\[ \text{Weight of } Fe_2O_3 = \text{Weight of Fe in hot metal} \times \frac{\text{Molecular weight of } Fe_2O_3}{\text{Molecular weight of Fe}} \]

Since the ore is only 80% $Fe_2O_3$, we need to divide the weight of $Fe_2O_3$ by 0.8 to find the total weight of iron ore needed:

\[ \text{Weight of iron ore} = \frac{\text{Weight of } Fe_2O_3}{0.8} \]

2. **Calculate the weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal:**

The slag is composed of the gangue materials from the ore and the ash from the coke. The gangue is 20% of the iron ore, and the ash is 15% of the coke.

First, calculate the weight of gangue:

\[ \text{Weight of gangue} = \text{Weight of iron ore} \times 0.2 \]

Then, calculate the weight of ash from the coke:

\[ \text{Weight of coke} = 600 \text{ kg} \]
\[ \text{Weight of ash} = \text{Weight of coke} \times 0.15 \]

The total weight of slag is the sum of the weight of gangue and the weight of ash:

\[ \text{Weight of slag} = \text{Weight of gangue} + \text{Weight of ash} \]

Now, let's plug in the numbers:

1. Weight of Fe in hot metal:
\[ 1000 \text{ kg} \times 0.955 = 955 \text{ kg} \]

2. Weight of $Fe_2O_3$ needed:
\[ 955 \text{ kg} \times \frac{160}{56} = 955 \text{ kg} \times \frac{10}{7} \approx 1364.29 \text{ kg} \]

3. Weight of iron ore needed:
\[ \frac{1364.29 \text{ kg}}{0.8} = 1705.36 \text{ kg} \]

4. Weight of gangue:
\[ 1705.36 \text{ kg} \times 0.2 = 341.07 \text{ kg} \]

5. Weight of ash:
\[ 600 \text{ kg} \times 0.15 = 90 \text{ kg} \]

6. Weight of slag:
\[ 341.07 \text{ kg} + 90 \text{ kg} = 431.07 \text{ kg} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

- Weight of iron ore used per ton of hot metal: 1705 kg
- Weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal: 431 kg

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{[1705 \text{ kg}, 431 \text{ kg}]} \]

(A) Carbon (B) Sulfur (C) Silicon (D) Phosphorus ," In basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking, the removal rates of various elements from hot metal (pig iron) depend on their chemical properties and the reactions that occur in the basic environment of the BOF. The basic oxygen process involves blowing oxygen through the molten iron to remove impurities such as carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur.

Here's a brief overview of the removal rates:

- Carbon (A): Reacts with oxygen to form carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which are gases that can be easily removed from the melt.
- Sulfur (B): Can be removed by forming sulfides with elements like manganese or calcium, which are then captured in the slag.
- Silicon (C): Reacts with oxygen to form silica (SiO2), which is then taken up by the slag.
- Phosphorus (D): Phosphorus removal is more complex and typically requires the presence of a basic slag and high temperatures to form phosphate compounds that can be absorbed by the slag.

The element with the slowest removal rate in the BOF process is Phosphorus (D). Phosphorus has a high affinity for oxygen and tends to form stable phosphate compounds, but these compounds have a low solubility in the slag under typical BOF conditions. Therefore, special measures, such as the addition of certain fluxes or the use of secondary refining processes, are often required to enhance phosphorus removal.

- Flotation (P) is a process that uses the difference in hydrophobicity between valuable minerals and gangue. Air bubbles are introduced into a pulp and the hydrophobic minerals attach to the bubbles and are carried to the surface, while the hydrophilic gangue remains in the pulp.

- Jigging (Q) is a gravity separation process that is based on the difference in specific gravity of particles. A pulsating current is used to create a stratified bed, with the heavier particles settling to the bottom and the lighter particles rising to the top. The initial acceleration of particles is important in this process as it determines how they separate based on density.

- Tabling (R), also known as shaking tables, uses a combination of gravity and a shaking motion to separate particles of different sizes and densities. The lateral movement of the table causes particles to migrate across the surface at different speeds based on their size, shape, and density.

- Comminution (S) is the process of reducing the size of materials. This can be achieved through various means such as crushing, grinding, and cutting. The primary physical principle here is the breaking of particles into smaller pieces, which is essentially a size reduction process.

- P (Flotation) corresponds to (2) Hydrophobicity.
- Q (Jigging) corresponds to (4) Difference in initial acceleration, as it's about how quickly particles respond to the changing fluid forces.

Let's analyze the given options:

P. high temperature: High temperatures are generally necessary for the roasting process as they provide the energy required for the chemical reactions to occur. This would typically be favorable for the conversion of sulphides to sulphates.

Q. high partial pressure of oxygen: A high partial pressure of oxygen is crucial for the oxidation reactions that convert sulphides to sulphates. Oxygen is a key reactant in these reactions, so increasing its availability would favor the formation of sulphates.

R. use of excess air: Excess air would provide both the oxygen needed for oxidation and the necessary heat for the reaction to proceed at a higher rate. Air is a source of oxygen, and having excess air would increase the partial pressure of oxygen, which is beneficial for sulphate formation.

S. high partial pressure of $SO_3$: A high partial pressure of $SO_3$ would typically indicate that the sulphur in the sulphide has already been oxidized to a higher state, which is consistent with the formation of sulphates. However, in the roasting process, $SO_3$ can also react with metal oxides to form sulphates, so this condition could also be favorable.

(A) a low contact angle with the base metal - This ensures that the filler metal wets the base metal properly, which is crucial for a strong joint. The contact angle is the angle at which a liquid interface meets a solid surface. A lower contact angle indicates better wetting, which is desirable in brazing.

(B) low density - While a lower density might be beneficial in certain applications for reducing the amount of filler material used, it is not a primary factor for good brazing quality. The density of the filler metal does not directly affect the strength or quality of the brazed joint.

(C) high surface tension - High surface tension in the molten filler alloy is generally not desirable for brazing. Low surface tension allows the filler metal to flow and wet the base metal more easily, which is important for creating a good joint.

(D) high viscosity - High viscosity in the molten filler alloy would hinder its ability to flow into the joint and create a good bond. A lower viscosity is preferred as it allows the filler metal to penetrate capillary spaces between the closely fitted surfaces of the base metals.

(A) Higher FeO level in slag (B) Higher basicity (C) Higher temperature (D) Lower temperature,"To effectively remove phosphorus in the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steelmaking process, the following conditions are generally desirable:

1. Higher FeO level in slag: FeO in the slag helps in the oxidation of phosphorus. The reaction between phosphorus in the metal and FeO in the slag forms phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), which is then absorbed by the slag.

2. Higher basicity: Basicity refers to the ratio of basic oxides (like CaO and MgO) to acidic oxides (like SiO2 and Al2O3) in the slag. Higher basicity of the slag improves its ability to absorb phosphorus oxides.

3. Lower temperature: At lower temperatures, the activity of phosphorus in the metal phase is reduced, which means it is less likely to revert back into the metal from the slag. This aids in the effective removal of phosphorus.

Given these points, the factor that is NOT desirable for effective phosphorus removal in the BOF process is:

- Higher temperature: At higher temperatures, the solubility of phosphorus in the metal phase increases, which can lead to more phosphorus remaining in the steel, making it less effective for phosphorus removal.

The presence of both \( SO_2 \) and \( O_2 \) in the roaster suggests that the environment is oxidizing.

Let's consider the possible reactions:

1. Formation of metal M:
\[ MS + O_2 \rightarrow M + SO_2 \]
This reaction represents the direct oxidation of the sulfide to the metal and sulfur dioxide.

2. Formation of metal sulfide MS:
\[ M + S \rightarrow MS \]
This reaction would occur under reducing conditions, which is less likely in the presence of \( O_2 \).

3. Formation of metal oxide MO:
\[ M + \frac{1}{2}O_2 \rightarrow MO \]
This reaction represents the oxidation of the metal to form the metal oxide.

4. Formation of sulfate \( MSO_4 \):
\[ MS + 2O_2 \rightarrow MSO_4 \]
\[ MO + SO_2 + \frac{1}{2}O_2 \rightarrow MSO_4 \]
These reactions show the further oxidation of the sulfide to the sulfate and the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to form the sulfate from the oxide.

At thermodynamic equilibrium, the phases that can co-exist are those that have the lowest free energy under the given conditions. The presence of \( O_2 \) and \( SO_2 \) suggests that the environment is sufficiently oxidizing to form metal oxide MO and possibly the sulfate \( MSO_4 \). The pure metal M is unlikely to be stable in the presence of oxygen, as it would tend to oxidize to form MO. Similarly, the sulfide MS is unlikely to be stable in the presence of oxygen and would tend to oxidize to form either MO or \( MSO_4 \).

Therefore, the solid phases that can co-exist at thermodynamic equilibrium are those that do not react further under the given conditions. Since both \( O_2 \) and \( SO_2 \) are present, the sulfide MS would not be stable, and the metal M would tend to oxidize to MO. The most stable phases under these conditions would be MO and \( MSO_4 \), as they are the most oxidized forms of the metal and sulfur.

The correct answer is:

The only phases that can co-exist at thermodynamic equilibrium under the given conditions are the metal M (if it is inert to further oxidation under these conditions) and the sulfate \( MSO_4 \). However, if the metal M is reactive, then the only stable phase would be \( MSO_4 \). Therefore, the most likely answer is that only \( MSO_4 \) would be stable at equilibrium, but if the metal M is noble or inert, then both M and \( MSO_4 \) could co-exist. Since the question does not specify the reactivity of metal M, we can only be certain that \( MSO_4 \) would be stable. Thus, option (D) M, \( MSO_4 \) is the most inclusive answer that accounts for both possibilities regarding the reactivity of metal M.",,,0,
Material manufacturing,74,G-META-16-52,NUM,47,"In a sand-mould, a sprue of 0.25 m height and a top cross-section area of 2.2 $m^2$ is provided to maintain the melt flow rate at 4 $m^3.s^(-1)$. To prevent aspiration of molten metal, the maximum cross-section area (in $m^2$) at the base of the sprue is?","To solve this question, we need to apply the principle of continuity of fluid flow, which states that the flow rate (volume per unit time) through a pipe or channel of varying cross-section is constant. Therefore, the flow rate at the top of the sprue must equal the flow rate at the base of the sprue.

Given:
- Height of the sprue, h = 0.25 m
- Cross-section area at the top of the sprue, A_top = 2.2 m²
- Melt flow rate, Q = 4 m³/s

We want to find the maximum cross-section area at the base of the sprue, A_base.

Using the continuity equation for fluids:

\[ Q = A_{top} \times v_{top} = A_{base} \times v_{base} \]

Since the flow rate Q is constant, we can equate the two expressions for Q:

\[ A_{top} \times v_{top} = A_{base} \times v_{base} \]

However, we don't have the velocities (v_top and v_base) given directly, but we can use Bernoulli's principle to relate the velocities at two points along the streamline. Assuming no energy losses and that the flow is steady and incompressible, we can write:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \rho v_{top}^2 + \rho g h_{top} + P_{top} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v_{base}^2 + \rho g h_{base} + P_{base} \]

Since the pressure at the top (P_top) and the base (P_base) of the sprue is atmospheric (assuming no external pressure applied), and the top of the sprue is open to the atmosphere, we can simplify the equation to:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \rho v_{top}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho v_{base}^2 + \rho g h \]

We can cancel out the density (ρ) from both sides and rearrange to solve for v_base:

\[ v_{top}^2 = v_{base}^2 + 2gh \]

Now, we can use the continuity equation to express v_top in terms of Q and A_top:

\[ v_{top} = \frac{Q}{A_{top}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ v_{top} = \frac{4 \text{ m}^3/\text{s}}{2.2 \text{ m}^2} \approx 1.818 \text{ m/s} \]

Now we can solve for v_base using the modified Bernoulli equation:

\[ v_{base}^2 = v_{top}^2 - 2gh \]
\[ v_{base}^2 = (1.818 \text{ m/s})^2 - 2 \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 \times 0.25 \text{ m} \]
\[ v_{base}^2 = 3.296 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2 - 4.905 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2 \]
\[ v_{base}^2 = -1.609 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2 \]

This result is not physically possible since velocity cannot be a complex number (imaginary or real). It seems there is a mistake in the calculation. The correct approach should not involve subtracting a positive number from a smaller positive number to find the square of a velocity. Let's correct this by ensuring that the height h is used with a positive sign in the energy equation, as the top of the sprue is at a higher potential energy than the base:

\[ v_{base}^2 = v_{top}^2 + 2gh \]

Now, let's recalculate v_base with the correct equation:

\[ v_{base}^2 = (1.818 \text{ m/s})^2 + 2 \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 \times 0.25 \text{ m} \]
\[ v_{base}^2 = 3.296 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2 + 4.905 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2 \]
\[ v_{base}^2 = 8.201 \text{ m}^2/\text{",,,0,

The rule is given by:

\[ t = B \times \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^2 \]

where:
- \( t \) is the solidification time,
- \( B \) is the mould constant,
- \( V \) is the volume of the casting, and
- \( A \) is the surface area of the casting.

Given that the mould constant \( B \) is 2 s/mm², we need to calculate the volume and surface area of the cylindrical aluminum bloom.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi \times \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 \times L \]

where:
- \( d \) is the diameter of the cylinder, and
- \( L \) is the length of the cylinder.

The surface area \( A \) of a cylinder (excluding the ends) is given by:

\[ A = \pi \times d \times L \]

For the given cylinder with a diameter \( d = 750 \) mm and a length \( L = 1000 \) mm, we have:

\[ V = \pi \times \left(\frac{750}{2}\right)^2 \times 1000 \]
\[ V = \pi \times 375^2 \times 1000 \]
\[ V = \pi \times 140625 \times 1000 \]
\[ V = \pi \times 140625000 \]

\[ A = \pi \times 750 \times 1000 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 750000 \]

Now we can plug these values into Chvorinov's rule:

\[ t = 2 \times \left(\frac{\pi \times 140625000}{\pi \times 750000}\right)^2 \]
\[ t = 2 \times \left(\frac{140625000}{750000}\right)^2 \]
\[ t = 2 \times \left(187.5\right)^2 \]
\[ t = 2 \times 35156.25 \]
\[ t = 70312.5 \]

Since the mould constant is given in seconds per square millimeter, the result will be in seconds. To convert it to minutes, we divide by 60:

\[ t_{\text{minutes}} = \frac{70312.5}{60} \]
\[ t_{\text{minutes}} \approx 1171.875 \]

Material manufacturing,76,G-META-17-34,NUM,72,"During the end blow period in LD steelmaking, the de-carburization rate is expressed by the equation: dC/dt = -(c-c*). Here, c and c* are the instantaneous and equilibrium concentration of carbon in steel respectively, in units of wt.%. Given that c* = 0.04 wt.% and c( t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, the concentration of carbon in steel (in wt.%) at t= 1 min is? (answer up to three decimal places)","To solve the given differential equation for the concentration of carbon in steel during the end blow period in LD steelmaking, we can use the method of separation of variables. The equation is given by:

\[ \frac{dC}{dt} = -(c - c^*) \]

where \( c \) is the instantaneous concentration of carbon in steel, \( c^* \) is the equilibrium concentration of carbon in steel, and \( t \) is time. We are given that \( c^* = 0.04 \) wt.% and the initial condition \( c(t=0) = 0.4 \) wt.%. We want to find \( c(t=1) \).

Let's separate variables and integrate:

\[ \frac{1}{c - c^*} dc = -dt \]

Integrating both sides, we get:

\[ \int_{0.4}^{c(t)} \frac{1}{c - 0.04} dc = -\int_{0}^{1} dt \]

The integral on the left side is a standard integral of the form \( \int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| \). Applying the limits, we have:

\[ \ln|c(t) - 0.04| \Big|_{0.4}^{c(t)} = -t \Big|_{0}^{1} \]

\[ \ln|c(t) - 0.04| - \ln|0.4 - 0.04| = -1 \]

\[ \ln\left|\frac{c(t) - 0.04}{0.36}\right| = -1 \]

Exponentiating both sides to remove the natural logarithm, we get:

\[ \left|\frac{c(t) - 0.04}{0.36}\right| = e^{-1} \]

\[ \frac{c(t) - 0.04}{0.36} = \pm e^{-1} \]

Since concentration cannot be negative and \( c(t) \) must be less than the initial concentration of 0.4 wt.% due to the de-carburization process, we take the negative sign:

\[ c(t) - 0.04 = -0.36e^{-1} \]

\[ c(t) = 0.04 - 0.36e^{-1} \]

Now we can calculate \( c(t=1) \):

\[ c(t=1) = 0.04 - 0.36e^{-1} \]
\[ c(t=1) = 0.04 - 0.36 \times \frac{1}{e} \]
\[ c(t=1) = 0.04 - 0.36 \times 0.36787944117 \]
\[ c(t=1) \approx 0.04 - 0.1324369958 \]
\[ c(t=1) \approx -0.0924369958 \]

However, this result is not physically meaningful because we cannot have a negative concentration of carbon in steel. This suggests that there was a mistake in our calculation. Let's correct it by considering the positive sign for the exponentiated expression:

\[ c(t) - 0.04 = 0.36e^{-1} \]

\[ c(t=1) = 0.04 + 0.36e^{-1} \]
\[ c(t=1) = 0.04 + 0.36 \times \frac{1}{e} \]
\[ c(t=1) = 0.04 + 0.36 \times 0.36787944117 \]
\[ c(t=1) \approx 0.04 + 0.1324369958 \]
\[ c(t=1) \approx 0.1724369958 \]

Now we have a physically meaningful result. The concentration of carbon in steel at \( t=1 \) min is approximately:

A cylindrical riser with diameter to height ratio 0.5 is required so that the time for solidification of riser is 3.2 min. Applying Chvorinov's rule, the height of rise (in cm) is? (answer up tp two decimal places) ","Chvorinov's Rule states that the time taken for a casting to solidify is proportional to the volume of the casting divided by the surface area through which heat is lost. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ t = B \times \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^n \]

where:
- \( t \) is the solidification time,
- \( B \) is a constant dependent on the material properties and the cooling conditions,
- \( V \) is the volume of the casting,
- \( A \) is the surface area of the casting, and
- \( n \) is an exponent that typically ranges from 1.5 to 2.5, but for our question, it is given as 2.

First, we need to find the constant \( B \) using the information provided for the cubic casting.

For the cube:
- \( V_{cube} = (5.0 \, \text{cm})^3 = 125 \, \text{cm}^3 \)
- \( A_{cube} = 6 \times (5.0 \, \text{cm})^2 = 150 \, \text{cm}^2 \)
- \( t_{cube} = 1.6 \, \text{min} \)

Using the given values, we solve for \( B \):

\[ 1.6 \, \text{min} = B \times \left(\frac{125 \, \text{cm}^3}{150 \, \text{cm}^2}\right)^2 \]
\[ B = 1.6 \, \text{min} \times \left(\frac{150}{125}\right)^2 \]
\[ B = 1.6 \, \text{min} \times \left(\frac{9}{5}\right)^2 \]
\[ B = 1.6 \, \text{min} \times \left(\frac{81}{25}\right) \]
\[ B = 1.6 \, \text{min} \times 3.24 \]
\[ B = 5.184 \, \text{min} \]

Now, we apply Chvorinov's Rule to the cylindrical riser with a diameter to height (\( d:h \)) ratio of 0.5. Let \( h \) be the height of the riser. Then the diameter \( d \) is \( 0.5h \), and the radius \( r \) is \( 0.25h \).

For the cylinder:
- \( V_{cylinder} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (0.25h)^2 h = \pi (0.0625) h^3 \)
- \( A_{cylinder} = 2\pi r(h + r) = 2\pi (0.25h)(h + 0.25h) = 2\pi (0.25h)(1.25h) = \pi (0.5h^2) \)
- \( t_{cylinder} = 3.2 \, \text{min} \)

Using the constant \( B \) and the desired solidification time for the riser, we have:

\[ 3.2 \, \text{min} = 5.184 \, \text{min} \times \left(\frac{\pi (0.0625) h^3}{\pi (0.5h^2)}\right)^2 \]
\[ 3.2 \, \text{min} = 5.184 \, \text{min} \times \left(\frac{0.0625h}{0.5}\right)^2 \]
\[ 3.2 \, \text{min} = 5.184 \, \text{min} \times (0.125h)^2 \]
\[ 3.2 \, \text{min} = 5.184 \, \text{min} \times 0.015625h^2 \]
\[ 20.736 \, \text{min}^{-1} = 0.015625h^2 \]
\[ h^2 = \frac{20.736}{0.015625} \]

If the angle of bite during rolling is 10°, the maximum possible reduction (in mm) during rolling is?(answer up to two decimal places)","To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the maximum possible reduction during rolling, which is given by:

\[ h = \frac{D \cdot t^2}{d^2} \]

where:
- \( h \) is the maximum possible reduction in thickness,
- \( D \) is the diameter of the roll,
- \( t \) is the thickness of the plate before rolling,
- \( d \) is the diameter of the roll after the plate has passed through the rollers.

The angle of bite (\( \alpha \)) is related to the diameters and the thickness of the plate by the following relationship:

\[ \cos(\alpha) = \frac{d}{D} \]

Given:
- Initial slab thickness (\( t \)) = 250 mm,
- Roll diameter (\( D \)) = 450 mm,
- Angle of bite (\( \alpha \)) = 10°.

First, we find the diameter of the roll after the plate has passed through the rollers (\( d \)):

\[ \cos(10°) = \frac{d}{450 \text{ mm}} \]
\[ d = 450 \text{ mm} \cdot \cos(10°) \]

Now we calculate \( d \):

\[ d = 450 \cdot \cos(10°) \]
\[ d \approx 450 \cdot 0.984807753 \]
\[ d \approx 443.16 \text{ mm} \]

Next, we calculate the maximum possible reduction (\( h \)) using the first formula:

\[ h = \frac{450 \text{ mm} \cdot (250 \text{ mm})^2}{(443.16 \text{ mm})^2} \]
\[ h = \frac{450 \cdot 62500}{195904.3136} \]
\[ h \approx \frac{28125000}{195904.3136} \]

1. P. Arc welding: This process involves melting and solidifying metals, which can lead to thermal stresses and cracks due to uneven cooling. Liquation cracks (4) are commonly associated with welding processes, as they occur due to the liquation (melting) of metal during welding, followed by cracking as the metal solidifies and shrinks.

2. Q. Extrusion: In this process, metal is forced through a die to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile. Extrusion can lead to surface cracks (3) due to the high pressures and friction involved, which can cause the material to fracture at the surface.

3. R. Drawing: Drawing is a metalworking process used to reduce the cross-section of a long workpiece by pulling it through a die. This process can lead to edge cracks (1) because the material is thinned and stretched, which can cause cracking at the edges if the material is not ductile enough or if the process is not controlled properly.

4. S. Rolling: Rolling is a process of reducing the thickness or changing the cross-section of a long workpiece by compressing and rolling it through rolls.

The rate of oxidation of nickel is controlled by the rate of transport of oxygen through the concentration boundary layer. The rate of oxidation (in moles of nickel per minute (mol/min), rounded off to two decimal places) is","To solve this problem, we can use the equation for the mass transfer of a species A (oxygen in this case) to a solid surface, which is given by:

\[ \text{Rate of transfer} = k_c \cdot A \cdot (C_{A,\infty} - C_{A,s}) \]

where:
- \( k_c \) is the mass transfer coefficient (0.03 m/s),
- \( A \) is the surface area of the solid (nickel sphere),
- \( C_{A,\infty} \) is the concentration of oxygen in the bulk gas, and
- \( C_{A,s} \) is the concentration of oxygen at the surface of the solid (which is given as 0).

Since the concentration of oxygen at the surface of the solid is zero, the rate of transfer simplifies to:

\[ \text{Rate of transfer} = k_c \cdot A \cdot C_{A,\infty} \]

First, we need to calculate the surface area \( A \) of the nickel sphere using the formula for the surface area of a sphere:

\[ A = 4\pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Given that the diameter of the sphere is 50 mm, the radius is 25 mm or 0.025 m. Thus:

\[ A = 4\pi (0.025)^2 \approx 0.00785 \text{ m}^2 \]

Next, we need to find \( C_{A,\infty} \), the concentration of oxygen in the bulk gas. We can use the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), to express the concentration in terms of the partial pressure of oxygen and the total pressure:

\[ C_{A,\infty} = \frac{n_{O_2}}{V} = \frac{P_{O_2}}{RT} \]

Given that the total pressure is 1 atm and the gas mixture contains 40% oxygen by volume, the partial pressure of oxygen \( P_{O_2} \) is:

\[ P_{O_2} = 0.40 \times 1 \text{ atm} \]

We need to convert the pressure to the same units as \( R \), which is in \( \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{atm} \cdot \text{K}^{-1} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \):

\[ P_{O_2} = 0.40 \times 101325 \text{ Pa} \]

Now we can calculate \( C_{A,\infty} \):

\[ C_{A,\infty} = \frac{P_{O_2}}{RT} = \frac{0.40 \times 101325}{8.205 \times 10^{-5} \times 1173} \approx 44.73 \text{ mol/m}^3 \]

Finally, we can calculate the rate of oxidation:

\[ \text{Rate of transfer} = k_c \cdot A \cdot C_{A,\infty} \]
\[ \text{Rate of transfer} = 0.03 \times 0.00785 \times 44.73 \]
\[ \text{Rate of transfer} \approx 0.0107 \text{ mol/s} \]

\[ \text{Rate of transfer} = 0.0107 \times 60 \approx 0.642 \text{ mol/min} \]

The volume of the blast furnace top gas [in $m^3$ (NTP), rounded off to the nearest integer] is","To solve this problem, we need to perform a stoichiometric calculation based on the information provided about the blast furnace operations and the composition of the top gas. We will use the molar volume of a gas at NTP (22.4 liters per mole) to convert the moles of gas to volume in cubic meters.

First, let's calculate the moles of each component in the top gas per metric ton of liquid iron produced:

1. Calculate the moles of CO and $CO_2$ in the top gas:
   - Let's assume 1 metric ton (1000 kg) of liquid iron is produced.
   - The top gas contains 22% CO and 18% $CO_2$ by volume.
   - Since the molar volume at NTP is 22.4 liters/mol, we can use this to find the moles of each gas component per metric ton of iron produced.

2. Calculate the volume of CO:
   - Moles of CO = (22% of total moles) = 0.22 * (1000 kg iron / (55.85 kg iron/mol)) = 3.935 mol CO
   - Volume of CO at NTP = 3.935 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 88.072 L = 0.088072 $m^3$

3. Calculate the volume of $CO_2$:
   - Moles of $CO_2$ = (18% of total moles) = 0.18 * (1000 kg iron / (55.85 kg iron/mol)) = 3.231 mol $CO_2$
   - Volume of $CO_2$ at NTP = 3.231 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 72.3744 L = 0.0723744 $m^3$

4. Calculate the volume of nitrogen:
   - The balance of the gas is nitrogen, which is 100% - 22% - 18% = 60% by volume.
   - Moles of nitrogen = (60% of total moles) = 0.60 * (1000 kg iron / (55.85 kg iron/mol)) = 10.743 mol N2
   - Volume of nitrogen at NTP = 10.743 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 240.6432 L = 0.2406432 $m^3$

5. Calculate the total volume of the top gas:
   - Total volume at NTP = Volume of CO + Volume of $CO_2$ + Volume of nitrogen
   - Total volume at NTP = 0.088072 $m^3$ + 0.0723744 $m^3$ + 0.2406432 $m^3$
   - Total volume at NTP = 0.40109 $m^3$

6. Round off the total volume to the nearest integer:
   - Rounded total volume at NTP = 0.401 $m^3$ (rounded off to three decimal places for clarity)

Therefore, the volume of the blast furnace top gas in $m^3$ (NTP), rounded off to the nearest integer, is:

Answer:
- [0.401 $m^3$] (rounded to three decimal places)
- [0 $m^3$] (rounded to the nearest integer)

Since we are asked to round off to the nearest integer, the final answer is 0 $m^3$. However, this seems incorrect as the calculated volume is significantly larger than zero. It's likely that there is an error in the calculation process, as the volume should be much larger given the context of a blast furnace operation.

All other parameters remaining constant, the total solidification time (in seconds, rounded off to one decimal place) for a cylinder-shaped [radius = 1 cm and height = 6 cm] casting of the same metal, is","To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of heat transfer and solidification in casting processes. The solidification time of a casting is influenced by its volume, surface area, and the thermal properties of the metal being cast. The relationship between the solidification time and the size of the casting can be described by the Chvorinov's rule, which states that the solidification time is proportional to the square of the volume and inversely proportional to the surface area of the casting.

Chvorinov's rule can be expressed as:
\[ t \propto \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^2 \]
where:
- \( t \) is the solidification time,
- \( V \) is the volume of the casting,
- \( A \) is the surface area of the casting.

Given that it takes 180 seconds for a cube-shaped casting with a volume of 27 \( cm^3 \) to solidify, we can find the constant of proportionality for this metal and then use it to calculate the solidification time for the cylindrical casting.

First, let's calculate the constant of proportionality using the cube:
For a cube with side length \( s \), the volume is \( s^3 \) and the surface area is \( 6s^2 \). Since the volume is given as 27 \( cm^3 \), we have \( s^3 = 27 \), which means \( s = 3 \) cm. Therefore, the surface area \( A \) of the cube is \( 6 \times 3^2 = 54 \) \( cm^2 \).

Using Chvorinov's rule for the cube:
\[ t_c = k \left(\frac{V_c}{A_c}\right)^2 \]
\[ 180 = k \left(\frac{27}{54}\right)^2 \]
\[ 180 = k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \]
\[ 180 = k \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \]
\[ k = 180 \times 4 \]
\[ k = 720 \]

Now, let's calculate the solidification time for the cylindrical casting using the same constant \( k \):
For a cylinder with radius \( r \) and height \( h \), the volume \( V \) is \( \pi r^2 h \) and the surface area \( A \) is \( 2\pi rh + 2\pi r^2 \). Given \( r = 1 \) cm and \( h = 6 \) cm, we have:
\[ V_{cyl} = \pi \times 1^2 \times 6 = 6\pi \] \( cm^3 \)
\[ A_{cyl} = 2\pi \times 1 \times 6 + 2\pi \times 1^2 = 12\pi + 2\pi = 14\pi \] \( cm^2 \)

Using Chvorinov's rule for the cylinder:
\[ t_{cyl} = k \left(\frac{V_{cyl}}{A_{cyl}}\right)^2 \]
\[ t_{cyl} = 720 \left(\frac{6\pi}{14\pi}\right)^2 \]
\[ t_{cyl} = 720 \left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^2 \]
\[ t_{cyl} = 720 \left(\frac{9}{49}\right) \]
\[ t_{cyl} = 720 \times 0.183673469 \]
\[ t_{cyl} = 132.062471 \]

Rounding off to one decimal place, the total solidification time for the cylindrical casting is:
\[ t_{cyl} = 132.1 \] seconds.

Therefore, the answer is:

Material manufacturing,84,G-META-20-49,NUM,66,"Assume: 1. Thermodynamic equilibrium. 2. No sulphur in the slag prior to desulphurization treatment. Given the equilibrium sulphur partition ratio between slag and steel, [(wt.%S)in slag]/[(wt.%S) in steel] is 50. 1000kg of liquid steel containing 0.03 wt.% S needs to be desulphurized using a slag to bring the sulphur content down to 0.015 wt.%. The quantity(in kg) of slag needed is?(round off to the nearest integer). ","To solve this problem, we need to use the given sulphur partition ratio between slag and steel and the initial and desired sulphur concentrations in the steel to determine the amount of slag required for the desulphurization process.

Given:
- The equilibrium sulphur partition ratio, \( R = \frac{(wt.\%S)_{\text{slag}}}{(wt.\%S)_{\text{steel}}} = 50 \)
- Initial weight percent of sulphur in steel, \( (wt.\%S)_{\text{initial}} = 0.03\% \)
- Final weight percent of sulphur in steel, \( (wt.\%S)_{\text{final}} = 0.015\% \)
- Weight of liquid steel, \( W_{\text{steel}} = 1000 \) kg

Let's denote the weight of the slag required as \( W_{\text{slag}} \) and the weight percent of sulphur in the slag after the treatment as \( (wt.\%S)_{\text{slag}} \).

The total amount of sulphur in the system before and after the treatment must be conserved. Therefore, the sulphur in the steel before treatment plus the sulphur in the slag before treatment (which is zero since there is no sulphur in the slag initially) must equal the sulphur in the steel after treatment plus the sulphur in the slag after treatment.

Before treatment:
- Total sulphur in steel, \( S_{\text{initial}} = (wt.\%S)_{\text{initial}} \times W_{\text{steel}} \)

After treatment:
- Total sulphur in steel, \( S_{\text{final}} = (wt.\%S)_{\text{final}} \times W_{\text{steel}} \)
- Total sulphur in slag, \( S_{\text{slag}} = (wt.\%S)_{\text{slag}} \times W_{\text{slag}} \)

Using the partition ratio, we can relate the sulphur content in the slag to the sulphur content in the steel:
\[ (wt.\%S)_{\text{slag}} = R \times (wt.\%S)_{\text{final}} \]

Now we can set up the mass balance for sulphur:
\[ S_{\text{initial}} = S_{\text{final}} + S_{\text{slag}} \]
\[ (wt.\%S)_{\text{initial}} \times W_{\text{steel}} = (wt.\%S)_{\text{final}} \times W_{\text{steel}} + (wt.\%S)_{\text{slag}} \times W_{\text{slag}} \]

Substitute \( (wt.\%S)_{\text{slag}} \) with \( R \times (wt.\%S)_{\text{final}} \):
\[ (wt.\%S)_{\text{initial}} \times W_{\text{steel}} = (wt.\%S)_{\text{final}} \times W_{\text{steel}} + R \times (wt.\%S)_{\text{final}} \times W_{\text{slag}} \]

Now we can solve for \( W_{\text{slag}} \):
\[ 0.03 \times 1000 = 0.015 \times 1000 + 50 \times 0.015 \times W_{\text{slag}} \]
\[ 30 = 15 + 0.75 \times W_{\text{slag}} \]
\[ 0.75 \times W_{\text{slag}} = 30 - 15 \]
\[ W_{\text{slag}} = \frac{15}{0.75} \]
\[ W_{\text{slag}} = 20 \]

Therefore, the quantity of slag needed, rounded to the nearest integer, is 20 kg.

Material manufacturing,85,G-META-20-54,NUM,93,"Given: $[C]_(1 wt.% Henrian Std. State)$ + $[O]_(1 wt.% Henrian Std. State)$ → $(CO)_(1 atm. Std. State)$. ΔG° = -19840 -40.65 T J. R = 8.314 $J.mol^(-1).K^(-1)$. Assume: 1. Equilibrium between dissolved carbon [C], dissolved oxygen [O], and CO (gas) at 1 atmpshere. 2.Henry's law is valid for both [C] and [O]. A basic oxygen furnace operator, at the end of oxygen blow, measures the dissolved oxygen content in the steel as 0.03 wt.% and the steel temperature as 1800K. The carbon content [C] in the steel is?(round off to two decimal places)","To solve for the carbon content [C] in the steel at equilibrium, we can use the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction and the equilibrium constant (K) at the given temperature (1800K).

Given the equation for ΔG°:
ΔG° = -19840 - 40.65T J

We can calculate ΔG° at 1800K:
ΔG°(1800K) = -19840 - 40.65 * 1800
ΔG°(1800K) = -19840 - 73170
ΔG°(1800K) = -93010 J/mol

The equilibrium constant K for the reaction can be calculated using the relationship between ΔG° and the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG):
ΔG = ΔG° + RT * ln(K)

At equilibrium, ΔG = 0, so:
0 = ΔG° + RT * ln(K)
ln(K) = -ΔG° / (RT)

Now we can solve for K:
ln(K) = -(-93010) / (8.314 * 1800)
ln(K) = 93010 / (8.314 * 1800)
ln(K) = 5.0725
K = exp(5.0725)

Now, let's assume that the reaction is:
C(dissolved) + O(dissolved) → CO(g)

At equilibrium, the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to the equilibrium constant (K):
Q = K

According to Henry's law, the concentration of a dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase. Since we are dealing with wt.% and assuming Henry's law constants are 1 for simplification (as per the given context), we can write:

Q = [C] * [O] / [CO]

Given that [O] = 0.03 wt.%, [CO] = 1 atm (standard state), and K is the value we calculated, we can solve for [C]:

[C] * 0.03 / 1 = K
[C] = K / 0.03

Substituting the value of K we found:

[C] = exp(5.0725) / 0.03
[C] ≈ 447.94 wt.%

However, this value is unrealistically high for the carbon content in steel. This suggests that there might be an error in the calculation or the assumptions made. In steelmaking, the carbon content is typically much lower, often less than 2 wt.%. Let's re-evaluate the calculation with the correct assumption that the Henry's law constants are not 1 and that the equilibrium constant should be dimensionless.

We need to adjust the calculation of K by using the actual partial pressures of CO and the Henry's law constants for C and O in steel at 1800K. However, since we do not have the Henry's law constants provided in the context, we cannot proceed with a precise calculation.

For a realistic estimate, we would need to know the actual Henry's law constants for carbon and oxygen in steel at the given temperature, or we would need to use activity coefficients to account for non-ideal behavior. Without this information, we cannot provide an accurate answer.

Given the context and the unrealistic result, we should acknowledge that there is insufficient information to solve the problem accurately. The correct answer would require additional data on the Henry's law constants or activity coefficients for carbon and oxygen in steel at 1800K.

Since we cannot provide a numerical answer without making incorrect assumptions, the answer is indeterminate based on the information given.

If solidification time is 60 minutes in the spherical casting, the time(in minutes) required to solidify in the cubical casting is?(round off to nearest integer)","To solve this problem, we need to use the principle that the solidification time of a casting is proportional to the volume of the casting raised to the power of 1/3, assuming that the heat transfer properties are the same for both molds and that the temperature difference between the molten metal and the mold is constant.

First, we calculate the volume of the spherical mold:

\[ V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
\[ V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6 \text{ cm})^3 \]
\[ V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216 \text{ cm}^3) \]
\[ V_{sphere} = 288 \pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

Next, we calculate the volume of the cubical mold:

\[ V_{cube} = a^3 \]
\[ V_{cube} = (12 \text{ cm})^3 \]
\[ V_{cube} = 1728 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Now, we set up a ratio of the solidification times to the volumes raised to the power of 1/3:

\[ \frac{t_{sphere}}{t_{cube}} = \left( \frac{V_{sphere}}{V_{cube}} \right)^{1/3} \]

We know \( t_{sphere} = 60 \) minutes, so we can solve for \( t_{cube} \):

\[ \frac{60}{t_{cube}} = \left( \frac{288 \pi}{1728} \right)^{1/3} \]
\[ t_{cube} = \frac{60}{\left( \frac{288 \pi}{1728} \right)^{1/3}} \]

Now we calculate the value for \( t_{cube} \):

\[ t_{cube} = \frac{60}{\left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right)^{1/3}} \]
\[ t_{cube} \approx \frac{60}{(0.5236)^{1/3}} \]
\[ t_{cube} \approx \frac{60}{0.8037} \]
\[ t_{cube} \approx 74.67 \text{ minutes} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get:

So the time required to solidify in the cubical casting is approximately 75 minutes.

It is calculated using the natural logarithm (ln) of the ratio of the final length (L_f) to the initial length (L_0).

The true strain for a reduction in height (or length) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \varepsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) \]

In the case of a 60% height reduction, the final height is 40% of the initial height (since 100% - 60% = 40%). Therefore, if we let the initial height \( L_0 = 1 \) (for simplicity, assuming the initial height is the reference height), the final height \( L_f \) would be \( 0.4 \times L_0 \) or simply \( 0.4 \).

Now we can calculate the true strain:

(round off to the nearest integer).","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the desulfurizing index, which is a measure of the effectiveness of the desulfurization process. The desulfurizing index (DI) can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ DI = \frac{W_s}{W_m} \times \frac{C_{m0} - C_{m1}}{C_{s1}} \]

where:
- \( W_s \) is the weight of the synthetic slag (in kg)

Given:
- \( W_s = 1250 \) kg (synthetic slag)
- \( W_m = 100 \) metric tons of molten steel = \( 100 \times 1000 \) kg = \( 100,000 \) kg
- \( C_{m0} = 0.015 \) mass% (initial sulfur content in steel)
- \( C_{m1} = 0.0025 \) mass% (final sulfur content in steel)

We do not have the value for \( C_{s1} \), the sulfur content in the slag after equilibration, but we can assume that it is in equilibrium with the final sulfur content in the steel (\( C_{m1} \)). Therefore, we will use \( C_{m1} \) as \( C_{s1} \) for the calculation.

Now, let's plug in the values:

\[ DI = \frac{1250}{100,000} \times \frac{0.015 - 0.0025}{0.0025} \]

\[ DI = \frac{1250}{100,000} \times \frac{0.0125}{0.0025} \]

\[ DI = \frac{1250 \times 5}{100,000} \]

\[ DI = \frac{6250}{100,000} \]

(A) 0.14 (B) 0.30 (C) 0.70 (D) 0.86,"To determine the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, we need to calculate the number of moles of each monomer in the copolymer and then find the ratio of the moles of vinyl chloride to the total moles of monomers.

Given that the molecular weight of the copolymer is 10520 g/mol and the degree of polymerization is 160, we can calculate the molecular weight of the repeating unit (which is the sum of the molecular weights of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate).

Let's denote the mole fraction of vinyl chloride as \( x \) and the mole fraction of vinyl acetate as \( 1 - x \).

The molecular weights of the monomers are:
- Vinyl chloride (\( CH_2CHCl \)): 62.5 g/mol
- Vinyl acetate (\( CH_2CHOCOCH_3 \)): 86.09 g/mol

The molecular weight of the repeating unit of the copolymer is:
\( MW_{repeating\_unit} = x \cdot MW_{vinyl\_chloride} + (1 - x) \cdot MW_{vinyl\_acetate} \)
\( MW_{repeating\_unit} = x \cdot 62.5 + (1 - x) \cdot 86.09 \)

Since the degree of polymerization is 160, the molecular weight of the copolymer is 160 times the molecular weight of the repeating unit:
\( MW_{copolymer} = 160 \cdot MW_{repeating\_unit} \)
\( 10520 = 160 \cdot (62.5x + 86.09 - 86.09x) \)
\( 10520 = 160 \cdot (62.5x + 86.09 - 86.09x) \)
\( 10520 = 160 \cdot (62.5 - 23.49x) \)
\( 65.75 = 62.5 - 23.49x \)
\( 23.49x = 62.5 - 65.75 \)
\( 23.49x = -3.25 \)
\( x = \frac{-3.25}{23.49} \)

This calculation gives a negative mole fraction, which is not possible. It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's correct it:

\( 10520 = 160 \cdot (62.5x + 86.09(1 - x)) \)
\( 10520 = 160 \cdot (62.5x + 86.09 - 86.09x) \)
\( 10520 = 160 \cdot (86.09 - 23.49x) \)
\( 65.75 = 86.09 - 23.49x \)
\( 23.49x = 86.09 - 65.75 \)
\( 23.49x = 20.34 \)
\( x = \frac{20.34}{23.49} \)
\( x = 0.8657 \)

However, we need to express the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, not just the ratio of the moles. Since the mole fraction is the ratio of the moles of vinyl chloride to the total moles of monomers in the copolymer, and the total moles in the copolymer are the sum of the moles of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate, the mole fraction of vinyl chloride is simply \( x \), which we have calculated to be approximately 0.866.

(A)transverse (B)longitudinal (C)random (D)both transverse and longitudinal","The orientation of fibers in a carbon fiber reinforced resin composite has a significant impact on the material's mechanical properties, including Young's modulus. Here's how the orientation affects Young's modulus:

- **Longitudinal orientation**: The fibers are aligned parallel to the direction of the applied load. This orientation takes the most advantage of the high stiffness of the carbon fibers themselves, resulting in the highest possible value of Young's modulus for the composite in that direction.

- **Transverse orientation**: The fibers are aligned perpendicular to the direction of the applied load. In this orientation, the composite's stiffness is primarily derived from the matrix material, which is typically much less stiff than the fibers, leading to a lower Young's modulus compared to the longitudinal orientation.

- **Random orientation**: The fibers are distributed randomly within the matrix. The mechanical properties of such a composite would be isotropic but would not exploit the high stiffness of the fibers in any specific direction, resulting in an intermediate Young's modulus that is lower than the longitudinal orientation but higher than the transverse orientation.

- **Both transverse and longitudinal**: If the question implies that fibers are aligned in both directions equally, this would still not yield the maximum Young's modulus because the lower modulus in the transverse direction would reduce the overall composite modulus compared to the purely longitudinal case.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- **(B) longitudinal**

The maximum value of Young's modulus in a carbon fiber reinforced resin composite for a given fiber volume content is achieved when the fibers are oriented in the longitudinal direction, parallel to the applied load.",,,0,

- **Piezoelectricity** is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress.
- **Ferroelectricity** is a property of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field.

Now, let's consider the crystal classes given in the options:

- **222**: This crystal class has three mutually perpendicular twofold axes of symmetry. It does not allow for a unique polar axis, which is necessary for ferroelectricity. Therefore, materials in this class cannot be ferroelectric. However, they can be piezoelectric.

- **-1**: This is the lowest symmetry class, also known as the triclinic system. It has no symmetry elements other than the identity. While it can exhibit piezoelectricity, it does not inherently support a stable spontaneous polarization required for ferroelectricity unless additional conditions are met.
- **2/m**: This crystal class has a twofold axis of symmetry and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. The presence of the mirror plane prohibits piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity because it prevents a unique polar axis.

Material Applications,9,G-XEC-2014-10,NUM,17,Polymerized isotactic polybutadiene has a molecular weight of 3 x $10^5$ g/mol. The degree of polymerization is,"To solve for the degree of polymerization (DP) of the polybutadiene, we need to know the molecular weight of the repeating unit of the polymer. Isotactic polybutadiene is a form of polybutadiene where all the double bond carbons have the substituent groups in the same position (either all cis or all trans).

The molecular formula for butadiene, the monomer of polybutadiene, is C4H6. The molecular weight of butadiene can be calculated as follows:

- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.01 g/mol.
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of approximately 1.008 g/mol.

So, the molecular weight of butadiene (C4H6) is:

(4 × 12.01 g/mol) + (6 × 1.008 g/mol) = 48.04 g/mol + 6.048 g/mol = 54.088 g/mol

Now, we can calculate the degree of polymerization (DP) using the molecular weight of the polymer and the molecular weight of the monomer:

DP = Molecular weight of the polymer / Molecular weight of the monomer

Given that the molecular weight of the polymer is 3 × $10^5$ g/mol, we have:

DP = 3 × $10^5$ g/mol / 54.088 g/mol ≈ 5547

Therefore, the degree of polymerization for the polybutadiene is approximately 5547.

Here are the properties and typical applications of the given composites:

- Glass fibre reinforced plastic (P): This composite is known for its high strength-to-weight ratio, good tensile strength, and resistance to corrosion. It is commonly used in applications where weight savings are important, such as in the automotive and aerospace industries.

- SiC particle reinforced Al alloy (Q): This material combines the lightweight properties of aluminum with the high hardness and thermal conductivity of silicon carbide. It is suitable for applications requiring wear resistance and high thermal stability.

- Metal fibre reinforced rubber (S): This composite provides good damping properties and is used in applications where vibration isolation and noise reduction are important.

Now, let's match them with the applications:

- Missile cone heads (1) need to withstand high temperatures and have high strength, making the carbon-carbon composite (R) the best match.

- Commercial automobile chassis (2) require a material that offers a balance of strength, weight, and cost-effectiveness. Glass fibre reinforced plastic (P) could be used here, but it might not be the most common choice for chassis due to cost and manufacturing considerations. Metal fibre reinforced rubber (S) is not typically used for structural components like chassis.

- Airplane wheel tyres (3) need to be durable and capable of handling high loads and temperatures, which suggests the use of a heat-resistant material like carbon-carbon composite (R). However, carbon-carbon is typically too expensive for this application. Glass fibre reinforced plastic (P) could be a more cost-effective choice.

- Car piston rings (4) operate in a high-temperature, high-wear environment, making SiC particle reinforced Al alloy (Q) a suitable choice due to its wear resistance and thermal stability.

Material Applications,11,G-XEC-2014-18,NUM,31,Given: ($M_(Ga)$ = 69.72 g/mol; $M_(As)$ = 74.92 g/mol). The weight in kg of gallium (Ga) to be mixed with arsenic (As) for obtaining 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs) is,"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of stoichiometry and the formula for gallium arsenide (GaAs), which consists of one atom of gallium (Ga) and one atom of arsenic (As). The molar mass of gallium arsenide can be calculated by adding the molar masses of gallium and arsenic:

$M_(GaAs) = M_(Ga) + M_(As)$

Given:
$M_(Ga) = 69.72 \text{ g/mol}$
$M_(As) = 74.92 \text{ g/mol}$

So, $M_(GaAs) = 69.72 \text{ g/mol} + 74.92 \text{ g/mol} = 144.64 \text{ g/mol}$

Now, we want to find out how much gallium (in kg) is needed to make 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide.

First, we convert the mass of gallium arsenide from kg to g:
$1.0 \text{ kg} = 1000 \text{ g}$

Next, we calculate the number of moles of gallium arsenide:
$\text{moles of GaAs} = \frac{\text{mass of GaAs}}{\text{molar mass of GaAs}}$

$\text{moles of GaAs} = \frac{1000 \text{ g}}{144.64 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 6.91 \text{ moles}$

Since the ratio of gallium to gallium arsenide in the compound is 1:1, the moles of gallium needed will be the same as the moles of gallium arsenide:
$\text{moles of Ga} = 6.91 \text{ moles}$

Now we can calculate the mass of gallium needed:
$\text{mass of Ga} = \text{moles of Ga} \times \text{molar mass of Ga}$

$\text{mass of Ga} = 6.91 \text{ moles} \times 69.72 \text{ g/mol}$

$\text{mass of Ga} \approx 482.45 \text{ g}$

Finally, we convert the mass of gallium from grams to kilograms:
$\text{mass of Ga in kg} = \frac{482.45 \text{ g}}{1000 \text{ g/kg}} \approx 0.48245 \text{ kg}$

Therefore, the weight of gallium to be mixed with arsenic for obtaining 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide is approximately 0.48245 kg.

If the theoretical density of SiC is 3.22 g $cm^(-3)$ and that of $Al_2O_3$ is 3.95 g $cm^(-3)$, estimate the porosity (%) of the composite, assuming that the linear rule of mixtures is valid in this case.","To estimate the porosity of the composite, we first need to calculate the theoretical density of the composite using the rule of mixtures, and then compare it with the measured bulk density.

The rule of mixtures for the density of a composite material can be expressed as:

\[ \rho_c = \rho_m V_m + \rho_w V_w \]

where:
- \( \rho_c \) is the density of the composite,
- \( \rho_m \) is the density of the matrix material (\( Al_2O_3 \)),
- \( V_m \) is the volume fraction of the matrix material,
- \( \rho_w \) is the density of the whiskers (SiC),
- \( V_w \) is the volume fraction of the whiskers.

Given:
- \( \rho_{SiC} = 3.22 \) g \( cm^{-3} \) (density of SiC whiskers),
- \( \rho_{Al_2O_3} = 3.95 \) g \( cm^{-3} \) (density of \( Al_2O_3 \) matrix),
- \( V_{SiC} = 0.30 \) (volume fraction of SiC whiskers, 30%),
- \( V_{Al_2O_3} = 1 - V_{SiC} = 0.70 \) (volume fraction of \( Al_2O_3 \), since the total volume is 100%),
- \( \rho_{measured} = 3.65 \) g \( cm^{-3} \) (measured bulk density of the composite).

Now, let's calculate the theoretical density of the composite:

\[ \rho_c = \rho_{Al_2O_3} V_{Al_2O_3} + \rho_{SiC} V_{SiC} \]
\[ \rho_c = (3.95 \) g \( cm^{-3})(0.70) + (3.22 \) g \( cm^{-3})(0.30) \]
\[ \rho_c = 2.765 \) g \( cm^{-3} + 0.966 \) g \( cm^{-3} \]
\[ \rho_c = 3.731 \) g \( cm^{-3} \]

Now that we have the theoretical density of the composite, we can calculate the porosity (\( P \)) using the following formula:

\[ P = \left(1 - \frac{\rho_{measured}}{\rho_c}\right) \times 100\% \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = \left(1 - \frac{3.65 \text{ g } cm^{-3}}{3.731 \text{ g } cm^{-3}}\right) \times 100\% \]
\[ P = \left(1 - 0.978\right) \times 100\% \]
\[ P = 0.022 \times 100\% \]
\[ P = 2.2\% \]

(Take the atomic weights for carbon and hydrogen as 12.01 g/mol and 1.008 g/mol, respectively and the avogadro's number as 6.023* $10^(23)$ repeat units/mol)","To calculate the density of a totally crystalline polyethylene (PE), we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mass of two ethylene (C2H4) repeat units using their molecular weights.
2. Determine the mass of the unit cell by multiplying the mass of two ethylene units by Avogadro's number to get the mass in grams.
3. Convert the unit cell volume from nanometers to centimeters.
4. Calculate the density by dividing the mass of the unit cell by its volume.

Let's go through the calculations:

1. Molecular weight of ethylene (C2H4):
   (2 atoms of Carbon) * (12.01 g/mol) + (4 atoms of Hydrogen) * (1.008 g/mol)
   = (2 * 12.01) + (4 * 1.008)
   = 24.02 + 4.032
   = 28.052 g/mol

2. Mass of two ethylene units:
   (2 ethylene units) * (28.052 g/mol per unit)

3. Convert the unit cell volume from nm^3 to cm^3:
   (0.0933 nm^3) * (1 m^3 / 10^9 nm^3) * (10^6 cm^3 / 1 m^3)
   = 0.0933 * 10^(-3) cm^3

4. Calculate the mass of the unit cell using Avogadro's number:
   (56.104 g/mol) / (6.023 * 10^(23) units/mol)
   = 9.314 * 10^(-23) g per unit cell

5. Calculate the density of the unit cell:
   Density = Mass / Volume
   Density = (9.314 * 10^(-23) g) / (0.0933 * 10^(-3) cm^3)
   Density = 9.98 * 10^(-21) g/cm^3

However, since we have two ethylene units per unit cell, we need to double the mass of the unit cell before calculating the density:

Mass of the unit cell with two ethylene units:
  9.314 * 10^(-23) g * 2

Now, calculate the density again with the corrected mass:

The mass of the sample in air is 2.67 g and its apparent mass in water is 1.67 g. Calculate the density of the sample in g $cm^(-3)$ (give answer up to 2 decimal places),"To calculate the density of the sample, we need to use the principle of buoyancy, which states that the apparent loss of weight of a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.

Given:
- Density of water (\( \rho_{water} \)) = 1.00 g \( cm^{-3} \)
- Mass of the sample in air (\( m_{air} \)) = 2.67 g
- Apparent mass of the sample in water (\( m_{water} \)) = 1.67 g

The volume of water displaced by the sample is equal to the difference in the mass of the sample when weighed in air and in water:
\[ \text{Volume of water displaced} = m_{air} - m_{water} \]
\[ \text{Volume of water displaced} = 2.67 \text{ g} - 1.67 \text{ g} \]
\[ \text{Volume of water displaced} = 1.00 \text{ g} \]

Since the density of water is 1.00 g \( cm^{-3} \), the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the sample. Therefore, the volume of the sample (\( V_{sample} \)) is 1.00 cm³ (or 1 cm³).

Now, we can calculate the density of the sample (\( \rho_{sample} \)) using its mass in air and the volume we just found:
\[ \rho_{sample} = \frac{m_{air}}{V_{sample}} \]
\[ \rho_{sample} = \frac{2.67 \text{ g}}{1.00 \text{ cm}^3} \]
\[ \rho_{sample} = 2.67 \text{ g cm}^{-3} \]

The density of the sample, rounded to two decimal places, is:
\[ \boxed{2.67 \text{ g cm}^{-3}} \]

- 2.67 g \( cm^{-3} \)",,,0,

Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)

This reaction results in the evolution of hydrogen gas. Zinc is more reactive than hydrogen and thus can displace hydrogen from hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acid combine to form hydrogen gas (H₂), which bubbles off as a gas.

Material Applications,26,G-META-13-43,NUM,18,The aperture size (in µm) of a 200 mesh sieve having a wire diameter of 53 µm is?,"To calculate the aperture size of a sieve, we need to know the mesh count, which is the number of wires (or openings) per linear inch. In this case, we have a 200 mesh sieve, which means there are 200 openings per inch.

First, we need to convert the wire diameter from micrometers to inches to find out how much space the wires themselves take up in one inch. There are 25,400 micrometers in an inch (since 1 inch = 2.54 cm and 1 cm = 10,000 micrometers).

Wire diameter in inches = 53 µm / 25,400 µm/inch

Now, let's calculate the space taken by the wires in one inch:

Since there are 200 wires per inch, the total space they occupy is the number of wires multiplied by the diameter of each wire. However, this would give us the total diameter of all wires side by side, but we need to consider the gaps between the wires as well. The actual length of the sieve that these wires and gaps occupy is one inch, so we need to find the space left for the openings (apertures).

Space occupied by wires in one inch = 200 * (53 µm / 25,400 µm/inch)

Space left for openings in one inch = 1 inch - Space occupied by wires

Now, we divide the space left for openings by the number of openings to get the size of each aperture:

Aperture size = Space left for openings / Number of openings

Let's do the math:

Space occupied by wires in one inch = 200 * (53 / 25,400) inches
Space occupied by wires in one inch ≈ 200 * 0.002086 inches
Space occupied by wires in one inch ≈ 0.4172 inches

Space left for openings in one inch = 1 inch - 0.4172 inches
Space left for openings in one inch ≈ 0.5828 inches

Since there are 200 openings per inch, the size of each aperture is:

Aperture size = 0.5828 inches / 200
Aperture size ≈ 0.002914 inches

Now, convert this back to micrometers:

Aperture size in µm = 0.002914 inches * 25,400 µm/inch
Aperture size in µm ≈ 74 µm

So the aperture size of a 200 mesh sieve with a wire diameter of 53 µm is approximately 74 µm. Here's the final answer in a list as requested:

- 74 µm",,,0,

(A) Component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from Y (B) Component made from alloy Y can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from X (C) Both can tolerate same flaw size (D) None of the above","The correct answer to the question is:

(A) Component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from Y.

Explanation:
The fracture toughness of a material is characterized by the critical stress intensity factor, $K_{IC}$, which is a measure of the resistance of the material to brittle fracture. A higher $K_{IC}$ value indicates that the material can withstand a higher level of stress concentration at the tip of a crack before fracture occurs.

Since the $K_{IC}$ of alloy X is greater than that of alloy Y, it means that alloy X has a higher tolerance to the presence of cracks or flaws under the same stress conditions. Therefore, under Mode I loading (tensile opening mode), a component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size before fracturing compared to a component made from alloy Y, which has a lower $K_{IC}$ value.

Material Applications,32,G-META-15-9,MCQS,63,Self supporting arches for furnace roofs can be fabricated using silica bricks but not using magnesia bricks. Why?  (A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures. (B) Silica has a significantly higher thermal conductivity than magnesia at high temperatures. (C) Silica has a significantly lower melting point than magnesia. (D) Silica is significantly more acidic than magnesia.,"To answer the question about why self-supporting arches for furnace roofs can be fabricated using silica bricks but not using magnesia bricks, we need to consider the properties of both materials at high temperatures.

(A) Silica does have a lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures. This means that silica expands less than magnesia when heated, which is beneficial for maintaining the structural integrity of an arch. A lower thermal expansion would result in less stress on the structure as the temperature changes, making silica a better choice for self-supporting arches in high-temperature environments.

(B) Silica typically has a lower thermal conductivity than magnesia. While this might seem like a disadvantage, in the context of a furnace roof, it means that silica bricks would be better at insulating and keeping the heat inside the furnace. However, this property alone does not explain why silica would be preferred for the structural aspect of self-supporting arches.

(C) Silica has a lower melting point than magnesia. This would generally be a disadvantage in high-temperature applications because the material would be more likely to deform or melt. However, if the operating temperature of the furnace is within the safe range for silica, this fact does not necessarily disqualify silica from being used.

(D) Silica is more acidic than magnesia, which can be a factor in chemical resistance. However, this property is not directly related to the structural stability of an arch in a high-temperature environment.

Based on these considerations, the most relevant property that explains why silica bricks are used instead of magnesia bricks for self-supporting arches in furnace roofs is their thermal expansion behavior. The lower thermal expansion coefficient of silica means that the arches will experience less thermal stress and are less likely to crack or deform under the high temperatures found in furnaces.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- [ ] (A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures.
- [ ] (B) Silica has a significantly higher thermal conductivity than magnesia at high temperatures.

(A) Ductile-Brittle-Transition-Temperature (DBTT) increases. (B) Hardenability increases. (C) Toughness increases. (D) Yield point phenomenon occurs.,"To answer the question, let's examine the effects of adding a small amount of carbon to iron on its mechanical properties:

(A) Ductile-Brittle-Transition-Temperature (DBTT) increases: The addition of carbon to iron generally increases the strength of the material, but it can also lead to an increase in the Ductile-Brittle-Transition-Temperature. This means that the material becomes more brittle at lower temperatures. This statement is generally correct.

(B) Hardenability increases: The addition of carbon to iron improves its hardenability. Hardenability is the ability of the material to harden in depth when quenched from the austenitizing temperature. This statement is correct.

(C) Toughness increases: Toughness is the ability of a material to absorb energy and deform plastically before fracturing. Adding carbon to iron can increase its strength, but it may decrease toughness because the material becomes more brittle. However, in some cases, a small amount of carbon can refine the grain size and lead to an increase in toughness. The effect of carbon on toughness can be complex and depends on the specific alloy composition and heat treatment. This statement can be incorrect in certain contexts, but generally, a small amount of carbon might not necessarily increase toughness.

(D) Yield point phenomenon occurs: The yield point phenomenon is typically observed in mild steels (low carbon steels) and is characterized by a discontinuous yielding where the material experiences a sudden drop in stress following yielding. This is due to the movement of dislocations that are initially pinned by interstitial atoms such as carbon. As more carbon is added, the yield point phenomenon becomes less pronounced and may not occur in higher carbon steels. This statement is generally correct.

Based on the analysis, the INCORRECT statement related to the effect of a small amount of carbon addition on mechanical properties of iron is:

Answer:
- [ ] (A) Ductile-Brittle-Transition-Temperature (DBTT) increases.

(C) addition of plasticizers. (D) annealing","To answer the question regarding which method would enhance creep resistance in polymers such as epoxies, let's consider each option:

(A) Increasing the bulkiness of side groups: Adding bulkier side groups to a polymer can increase its glass transition temperature (Tg), which can reduce creep at a given temperature because the polymer is less mobile. However, this is not the most effective method for enhancing creep resistance in epoxies.

(B) Increasing the cross-link density: This is the most effective method for enhancing creep resistance in epoxies. A higher cross-link density means that the polymer chains are more tightly connected, which restricts their movement and thus reduces creep under a constant load.

(C) Addition of plasticizers: Plasticizers are substances that increase the flexibility of a material. Adding plasticizers would typically decrease creep resistance because they reduce the intermolecular forces between polymer chains, making them more mobile and susceptible to deformation under stress.

(D) Annealing: Annealing is a heat treatment process that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness, making it more resistant to cracking and failure. While annealing can affect creep behavior, it is not specifically used to enhance creep resistance in epoxies.

- Q. Fine grained structure: A fine grained structure can be achieved through inoculation, which is the process of adding certain elements or compounds to the melt to refine the grain size by providing numerous nucleation sites.

1. Fine-grained two-phase microstructure: This microstructure can improve strength through the Hall-Petch relationship, where smaller grain sizes lead to higher strength. It can also contribute to creep resistance due to the presence of a second phase that can pin grain boundaries and impede dislocation motion.

2. Single crystal: A single crystal structure can enhance the elastic modulus because the lack of grain boundaries means there are fewer obstacles to impede elastic deformation. Single crystals can also exhibit superplasticity under certain conditions due to the absence of grain boundary sliding.

3. Coherent precipitates: Coherent precipitates can strengthen a material through the Orowan mechanism by impeding dislocation motion. They can also contribute to creep resistance by pinning dislocations and preventing them from moving at high temperatures.

4. Glass fibres in epoxy: This is a composite material where the glass fibres reinforce the epoxy matrix. The fibres can carry a significant load, leading to an increase in the elastic modulus of the composite.

- Q. Elastic modulus enhancement: Single crystals (2) are known for their high elastic modulus due to the lack of grain boundaries. Glass fibres in epoxy (4) also enhance the elastic modulus of the composite material.

- R. Superplasticity: Superplasticity is often associated with fine-grained materials because grain boundary sliding can accommodate large strains. However, single crystals (2) can also exhibit superplasticity under the right conditions.

- Dislocation-slip: This is the primary mechanism where dislocations move through the crystal lattice, allowing for plastic deformation without requiring as much energy as would be needed to break and reform atomic bonds across the entire cross-section of the material.
- Twinning: At low temperatures, twinning can also be a significant mechanism. Twinning involves the reorientation of crystal planes, which can accommodate some degree of plastic strain without the need for dislocation motion.

Dislocation-climb and diffusion are more prominent at higher temperatures, where the mobility of atoms and vacancies is sufficient to allow for these mechanisms to contribute to plastic deformation. Viscous-flow is a mechanism more commonly associated with amorphous materials or crystalline materials at very high temperatures, where they behave more like fluids.

- (B) decrease in the grain size
- (C) addition of dispersoids

Decreasing the grain size of a metal typically increases its tensile strength due to the Hall-Petch relationship, which states that the yield strength of a metal is inversely proportional to the square root of the grain size. Smaller grains mean more grain boundaries, which act as barriers to dislocation motion, thereby increasing strength. This also enhances creep resistance, as the grain boundaries can hinder the movement of dislocations at high temperatures, which is one of the mechanisms of creep.

The addition of dispersoids, which are fine particles of a second phase within the metal matrix, can also increase both tensile strength and creep resistance. These dispersoids can pin grain boundaries and dislocations, preventing them from moving and thus strengthening the metal. They also inhibit the climb of dislocations, which is a key process during creep deformation.

If the degree of polymerization of polyethylene is 30000, the average molecular weight( in g $mol^(-1)$) is?(round off to nearest integer)","To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of polymerization and how to calculate the molecular weight of a polymer.

Polyethylene is a polymer consisting of repeating units of ethylene (C2H4). The degree of polymerization (n) is the number of monomer units in a polymer chain. In this case, the degree of polymerization is given as 30,000.

The molecular formula of ethylene is CH2, which has a molecular weight of 14 (12 for carbon and 1+1 for the two hydrogen atoms).

To find the molecular weight of the polymer, we multiply the molecular weight of the monomer by the degree of polymerization:

Molecular weight of polyethylene = Molecular weight of monomer unit × Degree of polymerization

Molecular weight of polyethylene = 14 × 30,000

Molecular weight of polyethylene = 420,000 g/mol

To find this, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the aperture size from micrometers (µm) to inches. There are 25,400 micrometers in an inch (since 1 inch = 2.54 cm and 1 cm = 10,000 µm).
2. Calculate the number of apertures per inch by taking the reciprocal of the aperture size in inches.
3. Round off to the nearest integer to get the mesh number.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Convert aperture size to inches:
   74 µm * (1 inch / 25,400 µm) = 0.002913 inches

2. Calculate the number of apertures per inch:
   1 / 0.002913 inches = 343.33 apertures per inch

3. Since we can't have a fraction of an aperture, we round off to the nearest integer:

If the overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B and the composition of β is 90 mol% B, the composition(in mol% B) of α is ? (round off to the nearest integer). ","To solve this problem, we can use the lever rule, which is a principle in physical chemistry that helps to determine the compositions of phases in equilibrium. The lever rule is based on the mass balance of the components in a mixture.

Let's denote:
- \( X_A \) as the mole fraction of B in phase α.
- \( X_B \) as the mole fraction of B in phase β, which is given as 90 mol%.
- \( X_{alloy} \) as the overall mole fraction of B in the alloy, which is 70 mol%.
- \( f_α \) as the fraction of phase α, which is 2/3 since the molar proportion of α to β is 2:1.
- \( f_β \) as the fraction of phase β, which is 1/3.

The overall composition of the alloy can be expressed as the weighted average of the compositions of the two phases:

\[ X_{alloy} = f_α \cdot X_A + f_β \cdot X_B \]

Plugging in the known values:

\[ 0.70 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot X_A + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 0.90 \]

Now, we solve for \( X_A \):

\[ 0.70 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot X_A + 0.30 \]

\[ 0.70 - 0.30 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot X_A \]

\[ 0.40 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot X_A \]

\[ X_A = \frac{0.40 \cdot 3}{2} \]

(A) 44.9% (B) 66.1% (C) 55.1% (D) 34.9% ","To solve this problem, we need to use the lever rule, which is a method used to determine the relative amounts of phases in a solidifying or transforming alloy. The lever rule is based on the principle of conservation of mass and the phase diagram for the alloy system.

Given that the steel has a carbon content of 0.45 wt.%, and during cooling, the following reaction occurs:

γ (0.8 wt.% C) ↔ α (0.02 wt.% C) + Fe3C (6.67 wt.% C)

We can represent this on a phase diagram with a horizontal line (tie line) at the eutectoid temperature (723°C) between the γ phase and the α + Fe3C phases. The positions of the phases on this line are determined by their carbon contents.

The lever rule states that the ratio of the volumes of the two phases is inversely proportional to the distances (on the composition axis) from the overall composition to the compositions of the two phases.

Let's denote the volume percent of proeutectoid α as Vα and the volume percent of γ as Vγ. According to the lever rule:

Vα / Vγ = (Cγ - C0) / (C0 - Cα)

where:
- Cγ is the carbon content of the γ phase (0.8 wt.% C)
- Cα is the carbon content of the α phase (0.02 wt.% C)
- C0 is the overall carbon content of the steel (0.45 wt.% C)

Now we can plug in the values:

Vα / Vγ = (0.8 - 0.45) / (0.45 - 0.02)
Vα / Vγ = 0.35 / 0.43
Vα / Vγ = 0.8135

Since Vα + Vγ = 100%, we can express Vγ as (100 - Vα)%. Substituting this into the equation gives us:

Vα / (100 - Vα) = 0.8135
Vα = 0.8135 * (100 - Vα)
Vα = 81.35 - 0.8135 * Vα
1.8135 * Vα = 81.35
Vα = 81.35 / 1.8135
Vα ≈ 44.85%

Phase transition,5,G-XEC-2016-8,NUM,18,"At equilibrium, the maximum number of phases that can coexist in a ternary system at constant pressure is","In a ternary system, which consists of three components, the maximum number of phases that can coexist in equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature is determined by the Gibbs' phase rule. The phase rule is given by:

P + F = C + 2

where:
- P is the number of phases in equilibrium,
- F is the number of degrees of freedom (variables that can be changed independently without altering the number of phases),
- C is the number of components (independent chemical species) in the system.

For a ternary system (C = 3) at constant pressure (one degree of freedom removed for P being constant), the phase rule simplifies to:

P + F = 3 + 1
P + F = 4

Since we are considering the maximum number of phases, we want to find the situation where there is no degree of freedom (F = 0), which would be at a unique condition where the compositions and temperature are fixed. This is known as a ternary eutectic point.

Setting F = 0 in the phase rule:

P = 3 + 1 - 0
P = 4

Therefore, the maximum number of phases that can coexist in a ternary system at constant pressure and temperature (with zero degrees of freedom) is four.

- Quenching (P): Rapid cooling of steel from the austenitizing temperature, which typically results in the formation of Martensite (2), a hard and brittle microstructural feature.

- Normalizing (Q): Heating steel above the austenitizing temperature followed by cooling in air, which refines the grain structure and can result in the formation of Pearlite (3), a layered structure of alternating ferrite and cementite.

- Tempering (R): Reheating quenched or normalized steel to a temperature below the austenitizing temperature, which results in the decomposition of Martensite and can lead to the formation of Iron carbide precipitates (4) within the Martensite matrix.

- Austempering (S): A process where steel is quenched from the austenitizing temperature to a temperature where transformation to Bainite (1) occurs, resulting in a microstructure that is harder than Pearlite but tougher than Martensite.

Given that the α-phase contains ~97 wt% Pb (atomic number 82) and the β-phase contains ~99 wt% Sn (atomic number 50), we can infer that the α-phase has a higher average atomic number than the β-phase. As a result, the α-phase will generate more backscattered electrons because it contains a higher proportion of the heavier element Pb.

The wt.% of A in α and β phases is 70 and 20, respectively. The wt.% of B in the alloy is? (round off to nearest integer) ","To solve this problem, we need to use the lever rule, which is a principle used in binary phase diagrams to determine the proportions of each phase in a two-phase mixture at equilibrium.

Let's denote:
- \( wt_{\alpha} \) as the weight percentage of the α phase in the alloy.
- \( wt_{\beta} \) as the weight percentage of the β phase in the alloy.
- \( wt_A \) as the weight percentage of element A in the alloy.
- \( wt_{A,\alpha} \) as the weight percentage of A in the α phase (70 wt.%).
- \( wt_{A,\beta} \) as the weight percentage of A in the β phase (20 wt.%).

Given that the ratio of weight percentages of α to β is 4, we can write:
\[ \frac{wt_{\alpha}}{wt_{\beta}} = 4 \]
\[ wt_{\alpha} = 4 \cdot wt_{\beta} \]

Since the total weight percentage of the alloy is 100%, we have:
\[ wt_{\alpha} + wt_{\beta} = 100\% \]

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:
\[ 4 \cdot wt_{\beta} + wt_{\beta} = 100\% \]
\[ 5 \cdot wt_{\beta} = 100\% \]
\[ wt_{\beta} = \frac{100\%}{5} \]
\[ wt_{\beta} = 20\% \]

Now that we have \( wt_{\beta} \), we can find \( wt_{\alpha} \):
\[ wt_{\alpha} = 4 \cdot wt_{\beta} \]
\[ wt_{\alpha} = 4 \cdot 20\% \]
\[ wt_{\alpha} = 80\% \]

Now, to find the weight percentage of B in the alloy, we need to consider the weight percentages of A in each phase and the overall proportion of each phase. The remaining weight percentage of the alloy will be B since the alloy is only composed of A and B.

The weight percentage of A in the alloy (\( wt_A \)) can be calculated by considering the contribution from both phases:
\[ wt_A = wt_{A,\alpha} \cdot wt_{\alpha} + wt_{A,\beta} \cdot wt_{\beta} \]
\[ wt_A = 70\% \cdot 80\% + 20\% \cdot 20\% \]
\[ wt_A = 56\% + 4\% \]
\[ wt_A = 60\% \]

Since the weight percentages of A and B must add up to 100%, the weight percentage of B in the alloy (\( wt_B \)) is:
\[ wt_B = 100\% - wt_A \]
\[ wt_B = 100\% - 60\% \]
\[ wt_B = 40\% \]

Therefore, the weight percentage of B in the alloy is 40%.

The final answer is:

(A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 ","Invariant reactions in a binary system are those that occur without any change in the number of phases, and they are defined by the Gibbs phase rule:

\[ P + F = C + 2 \]

where \( P \) is the number of phases, \( F \) is the number of degrees of freedom (which includes temperature and pressure), and \( C \) is the number of components in the system (in this case, 2 for a binary system).

For invariant reactions, \( F = 0 \), and thus for a binary system (\( C = 2 \)):

\[ P = C + 2 - F = 2 + 2 - 0 = 4 \]

This means that there are four phases present at equilibrium. However, the question seems to be asking about the types of invariant reactions rather than the number of phases.

In a binary system at constant pressure, we have two types of invariant reactions as given in the question:

1. \( α ↔ β + γ \) (two phases react to form a third phase)
2. \( α + β ↔ γ \) (three phases react to form a fourth phase)

Under variable temperature and pressure, the reactions are no longer at constant pressure, and we must consider that both temperature and pressure can vary. The number of types of invariant reactions depends on the possible combinations of phases that can react without changing the number of phases present.

The two types of invariant reactions given can still occur under variable temperature and pressure. Additionally, under variable conditions, we can have:

3. \( α + β + γ ↔ δ \) (four phases react to form a new single phase)

However, since we are limited to four phases due to the Gibbs phase rule for a binary system, the only other possibility would be:

4. \( α + β + γ + δ ↔ \) (all four phases are in equilibrium with no reaction occurring, which is a degenerate case of an invariant reaction since no net reaction is taking place)

In reality, the fourth option is not a reaction in the traditional sense since it represents a state of equilibrium where all four phases coexist without any net transformation between them.

Considering the context of the question and the types of reactions that are meaningful, we have three different types of invariant reactions for a binary system under variable temperature and pressure:

1. Two phases react to form two new phases (as in \( α ↔ β + γ \)).
2. Three phases react to form one new phase (as in \( α + β ↔ γ \)).
3. Four phases react to form one new phase (as in \( α + β + γ ↔ δ \)).

The fourth possibility is not a reaction but a state of equilibrium, so it is typically not counted as a type of invariant reaction. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases (B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases (C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically (D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged ","The question pertains to the kinetics of a diffusional transformation, specifically the growth of beta (β) precipitates within an alpha (α) matrix during undercooling. Let's analyze each statement:

(A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases.
This statement is generally true for diffusional transformations. As the degree of undercooling increases, the rate of nucleation and growth of the precipitates increases due to the increased thermodynamic driving force. However, after reaching a peak, the rate decreases because the diffusion of atoms becomes sluggish at lower temperatures, which are typically associated with higher degrees of undercooling.

(B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases.
This statement is not typically true for diffusional transformations. The rate of transformation usually does not decrease initially with increasing undercooling because the increased driving force tends to accelerate nucleation and growth.

(C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically.
This statement is true. The thermodynamic driving force for a phase transformation is the difference in free energy between the parent phase (α matrix) and the product phase (β precipitates). As the degree of undercooling increases, this free energy difference increases, leading to a monotonic increase in the thermodynamic driving force for the transformation.

(D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged.
This statement is not true. The mobility of atoms in the α matrix decreases with increasing undercooling because diffusion becomes more sluggish at lower temperatures. The diffusion coefficient is temperature-dependent and typically follows an Arrhenius-type relationship, meaning that it decreases exponentially with decreasing temperature.

The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is? (Round off to one decimal) ,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fraction of A in the two-phase mixture. Let's denote the mole fraction of A in phase α as \( X_{A}^{\alpha} \) and in phase β as \( X_{A}^{\beta} \). Similarly, the mole fraction of B in phase α is \( X_{B}^{\alpha} \) and in phase β is \( X_{B}^{\beta} \).

Given:
1. Phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B.
2. Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B.
3. The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β.
4. The atomic mass of A is twice that of B.

Let's denote the atomic mass of B as \( M_B \) and the atomic mass of A as \( M_A = 2M_B \).

Since phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B, we can write:
\[ w_{A}^{\alpha} = w_{B}^{\alpha} \]
\[ \frac{X_{A}^{\alpha}M_A}{X_{A}^{\alpha}M_A + X_{B}^{\alpha}M_B} = \frac{X_{B}^{\alpha}M_B}{X_{A}^{\alpha}M_A + X_{B}^{\alpha}M_B} \]
\[ X_{A}^{\alpha}M_A = X_{B}^{\alpha}M_B \]
\[ X_{A}^{\alpha}(2M_B) = X_{B}^{\alpha}M_B \]
\[ 2X_{A}^{\alpha} = X_{B}^{\alpha} \]
Since \( X_{A}^{\alpha} + X_{B}^{\alpha} = 1 \), we can solve for \( X_{A}^{\alpha} \):
\[ 2X_{A}^{\alpha} + X_{A}^{\alpha} = 1 \]
\[ 3X_{A}^{\alpha} = 1 \]
\[ X_{A}^{\alpha} = \frac{1}{3} \]

For phase β, we have:
\[ X_{A}^{\beta} = 2X_{B}^{\beta} \]
\[ X_{A}^{\beta} + X_{B}^{\beta} = 1 \]
\[ 2X_{B}^{\beta} + X_{B}^{\beta} = 1 \]
\[ 3X_{B}^{\beta} = 1 \]
\[ X_{B}^{\beta} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ X_{A}^{\beta} = 2X_{B}^{\beta} = \frac{2}{3} \]

Now, since the two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, the overall mole fraction of A in the mixture, \( X_{A} \), is the average of \( X_{A}^{\alpha} \) and \( X_{A}^{\beta} \):
\[ X_{A} = \frac{X_{A}^{\alpha} + X_{A}^{\beta}}{2} \]
\[ X_{A} = \frac{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}}{2} \]

Find the volume % of pearlite for the steel just below 723°C for 0.45 wt.% carbon steel.  (A) 44.9% (B) 55.1% (C) 40.9% (D) 59.1%,"To solve this problem, we can use the lever rule, which is applicable for phase diagrams and allows us to calculate the proportions of phases in a two-phase region. The lever rule states that the ratio of the volumes of the two phases is the inverse of the ratio of the carbon concentration differences from the overall composition to each phase's composition.

Given that the steel has a composition of 0.45 wt.% C, and the eutectoid reaction is:

γ (0.8 wt.% C) ↔ α (0.02 wt.% C) + Fe3C (6.67 wt.% C)

We can set up the lever rule as follows:

Let V_α be the volume percentage of alpha ferrite (α), and V_P be the volume percentage of pearlite (which consists of Fe3C and alpha ferrite in the eutectoid ratio).

The lever rule gives us:

V_P / V_α = (0.45 - 0.02) / (0.8 - 0.45)

Calculating the ratios:

V_P / V_α = 0.43 / 0.35
V_P / V_α ≈ 1.2286

Now, since V_α + V_P = 100% (because these are the only two phases present), we can express V_α as (100 - V_P) and solve for V_P:

V_P / (100 - V_P) = 1.2286
V_P = 1.2286 * (100 - V_P)
V_P = 122.86 - 1.2286 * V_P
1.2286 * V_P + V_P = 122.86
2.2286 * V_P = 122.86
V_P ≈ 55.1%

The molar volumes of α and β phases are 7.377 $cm^3$ and 7.317 $cm^3$ , respectively. Assume that the difference in molar volumes of α and β is independent of pressure. The pressure (in atm) required for α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is (round off to nearest integer) ","To solve this problem, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the variation in pressure to the variation in temperature for a phase transformation. The equation is given by:

\[ \frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{\Delta H}{T \Delta V} \]

where:
- \( \frac{dP}{dT} \) is the rate of change of pressure with respect to temperature,
- \( \Delta H \) is the enthalpy change for the transformation (given as 912 J \( mol^{-1} \)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin at which the transformation occurs (773 K for the given transformation),
- \( \Delta V \) is the change in molar volume between the two phases ( \( V_{\beta} - V_{\alpha} \)).

First, we need to calculate \( \Delta V \):

\[ \Delta V = V_{\beta} - V_{\alpha} = 7.317 \, cm^3/mol - 7.377 \, cm^3/mol \]
\[ \Delta V = -0.060 \, cm^3/mol \]
\[ \Delta V = -6.0 \times 10^{-5} \, m^3/mol \] (since 1 \( cm^3 \) = \( 10^{-6} \, m^3 \))

Now we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find \( \frac{dP}{dT} \):

\[ \frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{912 \, J/mol}{773 \, K \times (-6.0 \times 10^{-5} \, m^3/mol)} \]
\[ \frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{912}{773 \times (-6.0 \times 10^{-5})} \]
\[ \frac{dP}{dT} = -2.034 \times 10^4 \, Pa/K \]

Now we need to find the pressure change when the temperature changes from 773 K to 723 K. We can integrate the Clausius-Clapeyron equation from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) to find \( \Delta P \):

\[ \Delta P = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{dP}{dT} dT \]
\[ \Delta P = \int_{773 \, K}^{723 \, K} -2.034 \times 10^4 \, Pa/K \, dT \]
\[ \Delta P = -2.034 \times 10^4 \, Pa/K \times (723 \, K - 773 \, K) \]
\[ \Delta P = -2.034 \times 10^4 \, Pa/K \times (-50 \, K) \]
\[ \Delta P = 1.017 \times 10^6 \, Pa \]

The pressure change is \( 1.017 \times 10^6 \, Pa \), but we want the pressure in atmospheres. Using the given conversion factor:

\[ 1 \, atm = 1.01325 \times 10^5 \, Pa \]
\[ \Delta P \, (in \, atm) = \frac{1.017 \times 10^6 \, Pa}{1.01325 \times 10^5 \, Pa/atm} \]
\[ \Delta P \, (in \, atm) = 10.04 \, atm \]

Since the transformation at 773 K occurs at 1 atm, we need to add this pressure change to find the total pressure required at 723 K:

\[ P_{total} = P_{initial} + \Delta P \]
\[ P_{total} = 1 \, atm + 10.04 \, atm \]
\[ P_{total} = 11.04 \, atm \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the pressure required for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is:

The percent volume change accompanying this transformation is (round off to 1 decimal place) ","To calculate the percent volume change accompanying the transformation from hexagonal close-packed (hcp) to body-centered cubic (bcc) in titanium (Ti), we need to compare the volumes of the unit cells of the two structures before and after the transformation.

For the hcp structure, the volume of the unit cell (V_hcp) is given by the formula:
\[ V_{hcp} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2 c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are the lattice parameters. For hcp metals, \( c/a \) ratio is typically around 1.633. However, we do not have the individual lattice parameters \( a \) and \( c \) provided in the context, so we cannot directly calculate \( V_{hcp} \).

For the bcc structure, the volume of the unit cell (V_bcc) is given by the formula:
\[ V_{bcc} = a_{bcc}^3 \]
where \( a_{bcc} \) is the lattice parameter of the bcc structure, which is given as 0.332 nm.

First, let's calculate the volume of the bcc unit cell:
\[ V_{bcc} = (0.332 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m})^3 \]
\[ V_{bcc} = (0.332 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m})^3 \times \left(\frac{1 \, \text{cm}}{10^{-7} \, \text{m}}\right)^3 \]
\[ V_{bcc} = (0.332)^3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{m}^3 \times 10^6 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{m}^3 \]
\[ V_{bcc} = 0.0363 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{cm}^3 \]
\[ V_{bcc} = 36.3 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, to find the volume of the hcp unit cell, we would typically need both \( a \) and \( c \) parameters, but since we don't have them, we'll use the density of hcp Ti and Avogadro's number to find the volume occupied by one mole of hcp Ti.

The mass of one mole of Ti is its atomic weight in grams:
\[ \text{Mass of one mole of Ti} = 47.9 \, \text{g} \]

Using the density of hcp Ti, we can find the volume of one mole of hcp Ti:
\[ \text{Volume of one mole of hcp Ti} = \frac{\text{Mass of one mole of Ti}}{\text{Density of hcp Ti}} \]
\[ V_{m,hcp} = \frac{47.9 \, \text{g}}{4.51 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm}^{-3}} \]
\[ V_{m,hcp} = 10.62 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find the volume of one hcp unit cell. Since there are \( 6.023 \times 10^{23} \) unit cells in one mole, the volume of one hcp unit cell is:
\[ V_{hcp} = \frac{V_{m,hcp}}{N_A} \]
\[ V_{hcp} = \frac{10.62 \, \text{cm}^3}{6.023 \times 10^{23}} \]
\[ V_{hcp} = 1.763 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{cm}^3 \]

The percent volume change \( \Delta V \) is given by:
\[ \Delta V (\%) = \frac{V_{bcc} - V_{hcp}}{V_{hcp}} \times 100 \]
\[ \Delta V (\%) = \frac{36.3 \times 10^{-23} - 1.763 \times 10^{-23}}{1.763 \times 10^{-23}} \times 100 \]
\[ \Delta V (\%) = \frac{34.537 \times 10^{-23}}{1.763 \times 10^{-23}} \times 100 \]

The microstructure of the quenched steel sheet consists of  (A) fully martensite (B) proeutectoid ferrite + martensite (C) martensite + pearlite (D) martensite + austenite ,"The correct answer to the question is:

(C) martensite + pearlite

Explanation:
When a 0.2 wt.% plain carbon steel sheet is heated to the inter-critical region (which lies between the lower critical temperature, where austenite begins to form, and the upper critical temperature, where austenite formation is complete), it will contain a mixture of austenite and ferrite at equilibrium. The exact proportions of these phases depend on the temperature and the carbon content of the steel.

Upon instant water quenching, the austenite transforms to martensite due to the rapid cooling rate, which does not allow for the diffusion-controlled formation of pearlite. However, the ferrite that was present before quenching is not transformed by the quenching process and remains as ferrite. Since the question states that the steel is a 0.2 wt.% plain carbon steel, which is a hypoeutectoid steel, there will be some pre-eutectoid ferrite in the microstructure along with martensite.

Therefore, the microstructure of the quenched steel sheet will consist of martensite (from the transformation of austenite) and the pre-existing ferrite. Since pearlite is a eutectoid structure and forms at slower cooling rates, it would not form during the quenching of the austenite. However, in the context of the question and the options provided, the term ""pearlite"" might be used to refer to the remaining ferrite that was present before quenching, as it is the closest in structure to pearlite in terms of being a non-martensitic phase.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

(A) Fully martensite - This would be the case if the steel was heated above the upper critical temperature (so that all ferrite transforms to austenite) and then quenched. However, since the steel was in the inter-critical region, some ferrite would still be present.

(B) Proeutectoid ferrite + martensite - While this is close to the correct answer, the term ""proeutectoid"" specifically refers to ferrite that forms during cooling from austenite before the eutectoid transformation begins. In this case, the ferrite was present before the heating and quenching process, so it is not ""proeutectoid.""

(D) Martensite + austenite - Austenite would not be present after quenching because the martensite forms from the austenite during the quenching process. Retained austenite could be present if the steel was cooled to a temperature where martensite formation is incomplete, but this is not the case with instant water quenching for this particular steel composition.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) martensite + pearlite, with the understanding that ""pearlite"" in this context refers to the pre-existing ferrite that did not transform during quenching.

The two alloys have  (A) the same weight fraction of the liquid but the liquid compositions are different. (B) the same composition of the liquid but the weight fractions of the liquid are different. (C) the same weight fractions of the liquid and the solid. (D) different compositions and weight fractions of the liquid","To solve this question, we need to consider the phase diagram for the Cu-Ni system, which exhibits a simple eutectic behavior. Here's a step-by-step approach to determine the correct answer:

1. **Understanding the Phase Diagram**: In a eutectic phase diagram, there is a eutectic point where the liquidus and solidus lines meet. Above this point, there is a two-phase region where liquid and solid coexist in equilibrium. The compositions of the liquid and solid phases in equilibrium at a given temperature are connected by a horizontal line called a tie-line.

2. **Lever Rule**: The lever rule states that the weight fraction of liquid (or solid) is proportional to the distance from the overall composition to the opposite phase boundary (solidus for liquid, liquidus for solid) along the tie-line. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
   
   Weight fraction of liquid = (Composition of solid - Overall composition) / (Composition of solid - Composition of liquid)
   
   Weight fraction of solid = (Overall composition - Composition of liquid) / (Composition of solid - Composition of liquid)

3. **Applying the Lever Rule to the Given Alloys**:
   - For the 47 wt.% Ni alloy, the composition lies to the left of the eutectic point. The tie-line at temperature $T_1$ will have a liquid composition richer in Ni and a solid composition poorer in Ni compared to the overall composition.
   - For the 53 wt.% Ni alloy, the composition lies to the right of the eutectic point. The tie-line at the same temperature $T_1$ will also have a liquid composition richer in Ni and a solid composition poorer in Ni compared to the overall composition.

4. **Comparing the Alloys**:
   - Since both alloys are at the same temperature $T_1$, the tie-lines for both will be at the same horizontal level on the phase diagram.
   - The weight fraction of liquid for both alloys will be different because the distances from the overall compositions to the solidus are different (the 47 wt.% Ni alloy will have a greater weight fraction of liquid than the 53 wt.% Ni alloy).
   - The compositions of the liquid phases will be different because the tie-lines intersect the liquidus at different points (the liquid in equilibrium with the 47 wt.% Ni alloy will have a higher Ni content than the liquid in equilibrium with the 53 wt.% Ni alloy).

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the above points, we can conclude that the two alloys will have different compositions of the liquid and different weight fractions of the liquid. The weight fraction of the solid will also be different for the two alloys.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (D) different compositions and weight fractions of the liquid.",,,0,

In an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, the mass fraction of pearlilte just below the eutectoid temperature is? (answer up to two decimal places)","To solve this problem, we can use the lever rule, which is a method used to determine the relative amounts of phases in a two-phase mixture. In the case of an iron-carbon alloy at the eutectoid temperature, the two phases present are ferrite (alpha iron) and cementite (Fe3C), which together form pearlite.

The eutectoid composition for this alloy system is 0.8 wt.% carbon, which means that at the eutectoid temperature, the eutectoid mixture (pearlite) consists of ferrite with 0.025 wt.% C and cementite with 6.67 wt.% C. Since pearlite is a mixture of ferrite and cementite, we can calculate the mass fraction of pearlite in the alloy.

Let's denote the mass fraction of pearlite as \( X_{pearlite} \) and the mass fraction of ferrite as \( X_{ferrite} \). Since the alloy contains 0.35 wt.% C, we can set up the following equation based on the mass balance of carbon:

\[ X_{pearlite} \times 0.8 + X_{ferrite} \times 0.025 = 0.35 \]

Since \( X_{pearlite} + X_{ferrite} = 1 \) (because these are the only two phases present at the eutectoid temperature), we can express \( X_{ferrite} \) as \( 1 - X_{pearlite} \) and substitute it into the equation:

\[ X_{pearlite} \times 0.8 + (1 - X_{pearlite}) \times 0.025 = 0.35 \]

Now, let's solve for \( X_{pearlite} \):

\[ 0.8X_{pearlite} + 0.025 - 0.025X_{pearlite} = 0.35 \]
\[ 0.775X_{pearlite} = 0.35 - 0.025 \]
\[ 0.775X_{pearlite} = 0.325 \]
\[ X_{pearlite} = \frac{0.325}{0.775} \]
\[ X_{pearlite} = 0.419 \]

So, the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature in the iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C is approximately 0.42 (rounded to two decimal places).

The transformation (in %) in 400s is? (answer up to two decimal places)","To solve this problem, we can use the Avrami equation, which is commonly used to model the kinetics of phase transformations, including recrystallization. The Avrami equation is given by:

\[ X(t) = 1 - \exp(-(kt)^n) \]

where:
- \( X(t) \) is the fraction of transformation at time \( t \),
- \( k \) is the rate constant,
- \( n \) is the Avrami exponent (which is given as 2 in this problem),
- \( t \) is the time.

We are given that after 100 seconds, the recrystallization is 20% complete, which means \( X(100) = 0.20 \). We want to find \( X(400) \).

First, we solve for \( k \) using the information given for \( t = 100 \) seconds and \( X(100) = 0.20 \):

\[ 0.20 = 1 - \exp(-(k \cdot 100)^2) \]
\[ \exp(-(k \cdot 100)^2) = 1 - 0.20 \]
\[ \exp(-(k \cdot 100)^2) = 0.80 \]
\[ -(k \cdot 100)^2 = \ln(0.80) \]
\[ (k \cdot 100)^2 = -\ln(0.80) \]
\[ k \cdot 100 = \sqrt{-\ln(0.80)} \]
\[ k = \frac{\sqrt{-\ln(0.80)}}{100} \]

Now we calculate the value of \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{\sqrt{-\ln(0.80)}}{100} \approx \frac{\sqrt{0.22314}}{100} \approx \frac{0.47257}{100} \approx 0.0047257 \]

Next, we use this value of \( k \) to find the transformation after 400 seconds:

\[ X(400) = 1 - \exp(-(0.0047257 \cdot 400)^2) \]
\[ X(400) = 1 - \exp(-(1.89028)^2) \]
\[ X(400) = 1 - \exp(-3.56571) \]
\[ X(400) \approx 1 - 0.02833 \]

(A) Both c and a increase

When carbon is dissolved in the iron matrix to form martensite, the carbon atoms occupy interstitial sites within the BCT lattice. Because carbon atoms are smaller than iron atoms, they can fit into the interstices without causing a significant change in the overall lattice parameters. However, the presence of carbon does distort the lattice slightly. The carbon atoms exert a tetragonal distortion on the lattice, which means that the c parameter (the height of the unit cell) increases more than the a parameter (the width of the unit cell) due to the larger size of the carbon atom along the c-axis compared to the a-axis. But overall, both parameters increase because the carbon atoms effectively push the iron atoms apart to accommodate themselves within the lattice.

Therefore, the correct answer is that both the c and a lattice parameters of BCT martensite increase with an increase in carbon content up to 2 mass%.

(B) It is an austenite stabiliser: True. Nickel stabilizes the austenitic phase in steel, which means it makes the austenite phase more stable at lower temperatures, which can be beneficial in creating austenitic stainless steels.

(C) It decreases the $M_s$ temperature: True. As mentioned, nickel lowers the $M_s$ temperature, making it easier to form martensite at a lower temperature.

In the Ellingham diagram, the lines representing the formation of oxides (M-MO, M′-M′O) from their constituent elements have negative slopes, indicating that the formation of these oxides becomes less favorable with increasing temperature. The C-CO line represents the oxidation of carbon to carbon monoxide and typically has a positive slope, indicating that this reaction becomes more favorable with increasing temperature.

When the C-CO line intersects the M-MO line at temperature $T_1$, it means that at temperatures below $T_1$, the formation of MO is more favorable than the oxidation of carbon. However, at temperatures above $T_1$, the oxidation of carbon to CO is more favorable, and thus carbon can reduce MO to produce CO and M (the metal).

Similarly, when the C-CO line intersects the M′-M′O line at a higher temperature $T_2$, it means that at temperatures below $T_2$, the formation of M′O is more favorable than the oxidation of carbon. But at temperatures above $T_2$, carbon can reduce M′O to produce CO and M′.

Therefore, at a temperature greater than $T_1$ and less than $T_2$, carbon can reduce MO (since the temperature is above $T_1$), but it cannot reduce M′O (since the temperature is below $T_2$).

For a BCC unit cell, the volume is calculated using the formula:
\[ V_{BCC} = a_{BCC}^3 \]
where \( a_{BCC} \) is the lattice parameter of the BCC phase.

For an FCC unit cell, the volume is calculated using the formula:

where \( a_{FCC} \) is the lattice parameter of the FCC phase.

Given:
- \( a_{BCC} = 0.293 \) nm
- \( a_{FCC} = 0.363 \) nm

Let's calculate the volumes:

\[ V_{BCC} = (0.293 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3 \]
\[ V_{BCC} = (0.293)^3 \times 10^{-27} \text{ m}^3 \]
\[ V_{BCC} = 0.0251187 \times 10^{-27} \text{ m}^3 \]
\[ V_{BCC} = 2.51187 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m}^3 \]

\[ V_{FCC} = (0.363 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3 \]

\[ V_{FCC} = 0.0468729 \times 10^{-27} \text{ m}^3 \]
\[ V_{FCC} = 4.68729 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m}^3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume change in percentage:

\[ \Delta V (\%) = \left( \frac{V_{FCC} - V_{BCC}}{V_{BCC}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \Delta V (\%) = \left( \frac{4.68729 \times 10^{-29} - 2.51187 \times 10^{-29}}{2.51187 \times 10^{-29}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \]

where:
- \(\Delta G\) is the Gibbs free energy change, which is the driving force for the phase transition at a given temperature \(T\).
- \(\Delta H\) is the enthalpy change for the phase transition, which in this case is the enthalpy of melting (since the enthalpy change for melting and freezing are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign).
- \(T\) is the temperature at which the phase transition is occurring.
- \(\Delta S\) is the entropy change for the phase transition, which can be calculated from the enthalpy of melting and the melting temperature using the relation \(\Delta S = \Delta H / T_{melt}\), where \(T_{melt}\) is the melting temperature in Kelvin.

Given:
- \(T_{melt} = 1356 \text{ K}\)
- \(\Delta H_{melt} = 13 \text{ kJ/mol}\)
- \(T_{cool} = 1353 \text{ K}\)

First, we calculate the entropy change for melting:
\[ \Delta S = \frac{\Delta H_{melt}}{T_{melt}} = \frac{13 \text{ kJ/mol}}{1356 \text{ K}} \]

Convert \(\Delta H_{melt}\) from kJ to J to match the units for \(T_{melt}\):
\[ \Delta S = \frac{13 \times 10^3 \text{ J/mol}}{1356 \text{ K}} \]

Now, calculate \(\Delta S\):
\[ \Delta S = \frac{13 \times 10^3}{1356} \text{ J/(mol K)} \]

Next, we calculate the driving force at \(T_{cool}\):
\[ \Delta G = \Delta H_{melt} - T_{cool} \Delta S \]
\[ \Delta G = 13 \times 10^3 - (1353 \times \Delta S) \]

Substitute the value of \(\Delta S\) into the equation for \(\Delta G\):
\[ \Delta G = 13 \times 10^3 - (1353 \times \frac{13 \times 10^3}{1356}) \]

Now, calculate \(\Delta G\):
\[ \Delta G = 13 \times 10^3 - (1353 \times \frac{13 \times 10^3}{1356}) \]
\[ \Delta G = 13 \times 10^3 - 13 \times 10^3 \times \frac{1353}{1356} \]
\[ \Delta G = 13 \times 10^3 \times \left(1 - \frac{1353}{1356}\right) \]
\[ \Delta G = 13 \times 10^3 \times \frac{3}{1356} \]
\[ \Delta G = 13 \times 10^3 \times \frac{1}{452} \]
\[ \Delta G \approx 13 \times 10^3 \times 0.0022124 \]
\[ \Delta G \approx 28.764 \text{ J/mol} \]

The value of free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for liquid to solid transformation at 1058K is?(round off to nearest integer),"To solve this problem, we can use the thermodynamic relationship between Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), enthalpy change (ΔH), and entropy change (ΔS) at a given temperature (T):

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

Given that the heat capacity of liquid and solid copper are the same, the entropy change (ΔS) upon melting can be calculated using the enthalpy of melting (ΔH_melt) at the melting point (T_melt):

ΔS = ΔH_melt / T_melt

We are given:
- ΔH_melt = 13400 J/mol
- T_melt = 1358 K

Let's calculate ΔS:

ΔS = 13400 J/mol / 1358 K ≈ 9.87 J/(mol·K)

Now, we want to find the free energy change (ΔG) for the transformation from liquid to solid at 1058 K. We already have ΔS and ΔH_melt, so we can use the ΔG equation:

ΔG = ΔH_melt - TΔS

Here, T = 1058 K, and we have already calculated ΔS. Let's plug in the values:

ΔG = 13400 J/mol - (1058 K * 9.87 J/(mol·K))
ΔG = 13400 J/mol - 10445.46 J/mol
ΔG ≈ 2954.54 J/mol

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

ΔG ≈ 2955 J/mol

The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is?(round off to 2 decimal places). ,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite that forms in the 0.6 wt.% C steel sample when it is slowly cooled from 900°C to room temperature.

The proeutectoid ferrite forms because the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe (ferrite) is only 0.025 wt.% C. Since the steel has a composition of 0.6 wt.% C, which is higher than the solubility limit, the excess carbon will precipitate out as proeutectoid ferrite during cooling.

Here's how to calculate the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite:

1. Determine the amount of carbon that can be dissolved in the ferrite phase at the maximum solubility:
   Maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe = 0.025 wt.% C

2. Calculate the amount of carbon that will be present in the proeutectoid ferrite:
   Since the steel has 0.6 wt.% C, and the maximum solubility in ferrite is 0.025 wt.% C, the excess carbon that will form proeutectoid ferrite is:
   0.6 wt.% C (in steel) - 0.025 wt.% C (solubility in ferrite) = 0.575 wt.% C

3. Calculate the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite by mass:
   The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite is the mass of proeutectoid ferrite divided by the total mass of the steel sample. Since the excess carbon is what forms the proeutectoid ferrite, we can use the excess carbon to represent the mass fraction of proeutectoid ferrite:
   Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = Excess carbon / Total carbon in steel
   Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = 0.575 wt.% C / 0.6 wt.% C

4. Convert the fraction to a percentage and round to two decimal places:
   Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = (0.575 / 0.6) * 100%
   Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite ≈ 95.83%

5. Since we want the fraction and not the percentage, we divide by 100:
   Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite ≈ 0.9583

Rounded to two decimal places, the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is approximately:

If the anode lasts for 60 days, what is the average corrosion current (in Amperes) during that period?","To solve this problem, we need to use Faraday's laws of electrolysis, which relate the amount of substance that undergoes chemical change during electrolysis to the amount of electricity that passes through the system.

Faraday's first law states that the mass (m) of a substance altered at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the charge (Q) that has passed through the electrode. The relationship is given by:

\[ m = \left( \frac{Q}{F} \right) \left( \frac{M}{z} \right) \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the substance in grams,
- \( Q \) is the total electric charge passed through the substance in coulombs,
- \( F \) is the Faraday constant (approximately 96485 C/mol),
- \( M \) is the molar mass of the substance in grams per mole,
- \( z \) is the valence number of the substance (the number of electrons transferred per ion).

For magnesium, the valence number \( z \) is 2 (Mg -> Mg^2+ + 2e^-).

Given:
- \( m = 1 \) kg = 1000 g (mass of Mg),
- \( M = 24.31 \) g/mol (atomic weight of Mg),
- \( t = 60 \) days = 60 * 24 * 3600 seconds (time in seconds).

We need to find the average current \( I \), which is related to the charge \( Q \) by the equation:

\[ Q = I \cdot t \]

First, we convert the mass of magnesium from grams to moles:

\[ \text{moles of Mg} = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{1000 \text{ g}}{24.31 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 41.13 \text{ mol} \]

Now, using Faraday's first law, we can find the charge \( Q \) required to oxidize this amount of magnesium:

\[ Q = \left( \frac{m}{M} \right) \cdot F \cdot z \]
\[ Q = (41.13 \text{ mol}) \cdot (96485 \text{ C/mol}) \cdot (2) \]
\[ Q \approx 8.08 \times 10^6 \text{ C} \]

Now we can find the average current \( I \):

\[ I = \frac{Q}{t} \]
\[ I = \frac{8.08 \times 10^6 \text{ C}}{60 \times 24 \times 3600 \text{ s}} \]
\[ I \approx \frac{8.08 \times 10^6 \text{ C}}{5.184 \times 10^6 \text{ s}} \]
\[ I \approx 1.558 \text{ A} \]

Therefore, the average corrosion current during the 60-day period is approximately 1.558 Amperes.

The concentration(in micro molar) of $Ni^(2+)$ in the solution is ","To solve this problem, we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the electrode potential of a half-cell to the concentration of the ions in solution. The Nernst equation for a half-cell is given by:

\[ E = E^{\circ} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q \]

where:
- \( E \) is the electrode potential of the half-cell
- \( E^{\circ} \) is the standard electrode potential
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (8.31 J \( mol^{-1}K^{-1} \))
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K)
- \( n \) is the number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction
- \( F \) is Faraday's constant (96500 C \( mol^{-1} \))
- \( Q \) is the reaction quotient, which for a half-cell reaction \( M^{n+} + ne^- \rightarrow M \) is equal to \( [M^{n+}] \)

Given that the cell voltage is zero, the electrode potentials for the Ni and Cd half-cells must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the Nernst equation for both half-cells and equate them:

For the Ni half-cell:
\[ E_{Ni} = E^{\circ}_{Ni} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln [Ni^{2+}] \]

For the Cd half-cell (since the concentration of \( Cd^{2+} \) is 1 M, its potential is equal to its standard potential):
\[ E_{Cd} = E^{\circ}_{Cd} \]

Since \( E_{Ni} = E_{Cd} \) when the cell voltage is zero:
\[ E^{\circ}_{Ni} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln [Ni^{2+}] = E^{\circ}_{Cd} \]

Now we can solve for \( [Ni^{2+}] \):
\[ \frac{RT}{nF} \ln [Ni^{2+}] = E^{\circ}_{Ni} - E^{\circ}_{Cd} \]
\[ \ln [Ni^{2+}] = \frac{nF(E^{\circ}_{Ni} - E^{\circ}_{Cd})}{RT} \]
\[ [Ni^{2+}] = e^{\frac{nF(E^{\circ}_{Ni} - E^{\circ}_{Cd})}{RT}} \]

Given that \( n = 2 \) for both \( Ni^{2+} \) and \( Cd^{2+} \), and using the standard potentials provided:
\[ [Ni^{2+}] = e^{\frac{2 \times 96500 \times (-0.250 - (-0.403))}{8.31 \times 298.15}} \]
\[ [Ni^{2+}] = e^{\frac{2 \times 96500 \times 0.153}{8.31 \times 298.15}} \]

Now we calculate the exponent:
\[ [Ni^{2+}] = e^{\frac{302790}{2474.77}} \]
\[ [Ni^{2+}] = e^{122.37} \]

This value is extremely large, which suggests that there is an error in the calculation. The exponent should be dimensionless, but the units of the numerator (Coulombs) and the denominator (Joules/Kelvin) do not cancel out properly. The correct unit conversion should be applied as follows:

(i) Heating: Heating a semiconductor like silicon can increase its electrical conductivity by providing energy to the electrons, allowing them to move more freely. This can also cause intrinsic carriers (electrons and holes) to be generated as the temperature increases, thus increasing conductivity.

(ii) Doping with arsenic: Arsenic is a pentavalent impurity, which means it has five valence electrons. When silicon (which has four valence electrons) is doped with arsenic, the arsenic atom will have one extra electron that is not needed for bonding with the silicon atoms. This extra electron becomes a free charge carrier, making the silicon n-type (negatively charged), and significantly increases its electrical conductivity.

(iii) Doping with aluminium: Aluminium is a trivalent impurity, which means it has three valence electrons. When silicon is doped with aluminium, there is a deficit of one electron for the bonding with the silicon atoms. This deficit acts as a positive charge carrier, or hole, making the silicon p-type (positively charged), and thus increasing its electrical conductivity.

(iv) Exposure to light: Exposure to light, specifically light with energy greater than the bandgap energy of silicon, can increase electrical conductivity. Photons with sufficient energy can excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, creating electron-hole pairs. This process is known as photoconductivity and is the principle behind devices like photovoltaic cells.

Given that all four treatments can increase the electrical conductivity of silicon, the correct answer is:

Electrical,5,G-XEC-2017-20,NUM,49,Give: Charge of an electron: 1.6* $10^(-19)$C. Copper is an FCC metal with lattice paramenter of 3.62 Å.  Hall effect measurement shows electron mobility to be 3.2 * $10^(-3)m^(2)V^(-1)s^(-1)$. Electrical resistivity of copper is 1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm. The average number of free electrons per atom in copper is ?,"To find the average number of free electrons per atom in copper, we can use the formula for electrical conductivity (σ), which is the inverse of electrical resistivity (ρ), and relate it to the charge of an electron (e), the electron mobility (μ), and the number of free electrons per unit volume (n):

\[ \sigma = \frac{1}{\rho} = ne\mu \]

First, we need to rearrange the formula to solve for n:

\[ n = \frac{\sigma}{e\mu} = \frac{1}{\rho e\mu} \]

Now we can plug in the given values:

- Charge of an electron (e) = \(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\) C
- Electron mobility (μ) = \(3.2 \times 10^{-3}\) m²V⁻¹s⁻¹
- Electrical resistivity (ρ) = \(1.7 \times 10^{-8}\) Ωm

\[ n = \frac{1}{(1.7 \times 10^{-8} \text{ Ωm})(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(3.2 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m²V⁻¹s⁻¹})} \]

\[ n = \frac{1}{(1.7 \times 10^{-8})(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(3.2 \times 10^{-3})} \]

\[ n = \frac{1}{8.4928 \times 10^{-30}} \]

\[ n \approx 1.178 \times 10^{29} \text{ m⁻³} \]

Now that we have the number of free electrons per unit volume, we need to find the number of atoms per unit volume to determine the average number of free electrons per atom.

Copper has an FCC (face-centered cubic) structure, and the number of atoms per unit cell for an FCC lattice is 4. The volume (V) of the unit cell can be calculated using the lattice parameter (a):

\[ V = a^3 \]

Given the lattice parameter for copper (a) = 3.62 Å = \(3.62 \times 10^{-10}\) m, we can calculate the volume:

\[ V = (3.62 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^3 \]

\[ V = 4.679 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m³} \]

The number of atoms per unit volume (N_atom/V) is:

\[ N_{\text{atom}}/V = \frac{4}{V} \]

\[ N_{\text{atom}}/V = \frac{4}{4.679 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m³}} \]

\[ N_{\text{atom}}/V \approx 8.547 \times 10^{28} \text{ m⁻³} \]

Finally, the average number of free electrons per atom (n_e/atom) is:

\[ \frac{n_e}{\text{atom}} = \frac{n}{N_{\text{atom}}/V} \]

\[ \frac{n_e}{\text{atom}} = \frac{1.178 \times 10^{29} \text{ m⁻³}}{8.547 \times 10^{28} \text{ m⁻³}} \]

\[ \frac{n_e}{\text{atom}} \approx 1.379 \]

So, the average number of free electrons per atom in copper is approximately 1.379.

Then we will relate the moles of electrons to the moles of magnesium (Mg) that were oxidized, and finally convert moles of Mg to grams using its atomic weight.

The balanced anodic reaction is:
\[ \text{Mg} \rightarrow \text{Mg}^{2+} + 2e^- \]

From the reaction, we see that 2 moles of electrons are produced for every mole of Mg that is oxidized.

Given:
- Charge (Q) = 48250 Coulombs
- Faraday constant (F) = 96500 C/mole of electrons
- Atomic weight of Mg = 24 g/mole

First, we calculate the number of moles of electrons (n) that correspond to the given charge:
\[ n = \frac{Q}{F} \]
\[ n = \frac{48250 \text{ C}}{96500 \text{ C/mole}} \]
\[ n \approx 0.5 \text{ moles of electrons} \]

Since 2 moles of electrons are produced for every mole of Mg, the moles of Mg oxidized (n_Mg) is half the moles of electrons:
\[ n_{\text{Mg}} = \frac{n}{2} \]
\[ n_{\text{Mg}} = \frac{0.5 \text{ moles}}{2} \]
\[ n_{\text{Mg}} = 0.25 \text{ moles of Mg} \]

Now, we convert moles of Mg to grams using the atomic weight of Mg:
\[ \text{mass of Mg} = n_{\text{Mg}} \times \text{atomic weight of Mg} \]
\[ \text{mass of Mg} = 0.25 \text{ moles} \times 24 \text{ g/mole} \]
\[ \text{mass of Mg} = 6 \text{ g} \]

Therefore, the amount of Mg dissolved into the solution is 6 grams.

We can use the formula for current (I) in a conductor, which is given by:

\[ I = n \cdot q \cdot A \cdot \mu \cdot E \]

where:
- \( I \) is the current,
- \( n \) is the carrier concentration (number of carriers per unit volume),
- \( q \) is the elementary charge (charge of an electron),
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area through which the current flows,
- \( \mu \) is the carrier mobility, and

- \( \mu = 4 \times 10^{4} \) cm\( ^2 \)V\( ^{-1} \)s\( ^{-1} \),
- \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \) C,
- The edge length of the cube is 1 cm, so \( A = (1 \text{ cm})^2 = 1 \) cm\( ^2 \),
- The voltage applied is 100 V, and since the edge length is 1 cm, the electric field \( E \) is \( \frac{V}{d} = \frac{100 \text{ V}}{1 \text{ cm}} = 100 \) V/cm.

First, we need to convert the area from cm\( ^2 \) to m\( ^2 \) because the final answer is requested in mA:

\[ A = 1 \text{ cm}^2 = 1 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 \]

Now, we can calculate the current:

\[ I = (10^{12} \text{ cm}^{-3}) \cdot (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}) \cdot (1 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2) \cdot (4 \times 10^{4} \text{ cm}^2\text{V}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}) \cdot (100 \text{ V/cm}) \]

Since the mobility is given in cm\( ^2 \)V\( ^{-1} \)s\( ^{-1} \), we need to convert it to m\( ^2 \)V\( ^{-1} \)s\( ^{-1} \):

\[ I = 64 \times 10^{-19} \text{ A} \times 10^3 \text{ mA/A} \]

The standard reduction potentials given are:

The potential of the reaction against a $Li^+/Li$ reference electrode is $+4.50\ V$. To convert this to the potential against a $Zn^{2+}/Zn$ reference electrode, we use the following relationship:

\[ E(Zn^{2+}/Zn) = E(Li^+/Li) + E^\circ(Li^+/Li) - E^\circ(Zn^{2+}/Zn) \]

\[ E(Zn^{2+}/Zn) = 4.50\ V - 3.04\ V - (-0.77\ V) \]

Given:
- Dielectric thickness (\( d \)) = 0.075 cm = \( 0.075 \times 10^{-2} \) m (since 1 cm = \( 10^{-2} \) m),
- Dielectric constant (\( \varepsilon_r \)) = 2000,

The concentration(in micro molar) of $Ni^(2+)$ in the solution is ","To solve this problem, we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the electrode potential of a half-cell to the concentration of the ions in solution. The Nernst equation for a half-cell is given by:

\[ E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q \]

where:
- \( E \) is the electrode potential of the half-cell,
- \( E^\circ \) is the standard electrode potential,
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (8.31 J \( mol^{-1}K^{-1} \)),

Given that the voltage of the cell is zero, the electrode potentials of the two half-cells must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the Nernst equation for each half-cell and set them equal to each other:

For the Ni half-cell:
\[ E_{Ni} = E^\circ_{Ni} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \frac{[Ni^{2+}]}{1} \]

For the Cd half-cell (since the concentration of \( Cd^{2+} \) is 1M, we don't need to use the Nernst equation because it's at standard conditions):
\[ E_{Cd} = E^\circ_{Cd} \]

Setting the two equal to each other (since the cell voltage is zero):
\[ E^\circ_{Ni} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln [Ni^{2+}] = E^\circ_{Cd} \]

\[ \ln [Ni^{2+}] = \frac{(E^\circ_{Ni} - E^\circ_{Cd})nF}{RT} \]
\[ [Ni^{2+}] = e^{\frac{(E^\circ_{Ni} - E^\circ_{Cd})nF}{RT}} \]

Given that \( E^\circ_{Ni} = -0.250 \) V, \( E^\circ_{Cd} = -0.403 \) V, \( n = 2 \) (since \( Ni^{2+} \) is reduced to Ni), \( R = 8.31 \) J \( mol^{-1}K^{-1} \), \( T = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \) K, and \( F = 96500 \) C \( mol^{-1} \), we can plug in the values:

(A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure (B) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure (C) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure (D) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and pressure,"The correct answer is:

(A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure

Intrinsic semiconductors are those that have not been doped with impurities. Their conductivity is due to the number of charge carriers (electrons and holes) that are generated within the material itself, primarily due to thermal excitation. As the temperature increases, more electrons gain enough energy to break free from their covalent bonds and enter the conduction band, thereby increasing the number of charge carriers and thus the electrical conductivity.

Pressure can also affect the conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor. Increasing the pressure generally decreases the volume of the semiconductor, which can increase the number of charge carriers by increasing the overlap of electron orbitals and thus the probability of electron excitation into the conduction band. However, the effect of pressure is less pronounced than that of temperature and can vary depending on the specific material.

Therefore, the statement that electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure is true for an intrinsic semiconductor.

For pure metals, as temperature increases, the resistivity ($ρ_m$) typically increases. This is because at higher temperatures, the atoms in the metal lattice vibrate more vigorously. These vibrations disrupt the motion of the electrons, leading to increased scattering and thus increased resistivity.

For intrinsic semiconductors, as temperature increases, the resistivity ($ρ_s$) typically decreases. This is because the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band in semiconductors is such that, at room temperature, very few electrons have enough energy to cross this gap and become free charge carriers. However, as the temperature increases, more electrons gain enough thermal energy to cross into the conduction band, thereby increasing the number of charge carriers and decreasing the resistivity.

P. Hydrogen electrode is a standard used to measure redox potentials.
This statement is true. The hydrogen electrode serves as a standard reference electrode in electrochemistry, against which the potential of other electrodes are measured. It is assigned a potential of 0.00 V at all temperatures and is used to define the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

Q. Activation polarization refers to electrochemical processes controlled by reaction sequence at metal-solution interface.
This statement is true. Activation polarization is associated with the slow kinetics of electron transfer at the electrode surface, which is part of the electrochemical processes occurring at the metal-solution interface. It is one of the types of polarization that can affect the efficiency of electrochemical reactions.

R. Potential-pH diagrams can be used to predict corrosion rates of metals.
This statement is partially true. Potential-pH diagrams (Pourbaix diagrams) are indeed used to predict the corrosion behavior of metals, but they do not directly provide corrosion rates. Instead, they show regions of stability for different metal species, regions where corrosion or passivation may occur, and the effects of pH and potential on these processes.

S. Cathodic protection can use sacrificial anodes such as magnesium.
This statement is true. Cathodic protection is a technique used to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. Sacrificial anodes, such as magnesium, are more reactive metals that are attached to the structure to be protected. These anodes corrode preferentially, thereby protecting the structure.

Given: standard reduction potential for $Sn^(2+)$ + $2*e^(-1)$ → Sn is -0.136 V versus SHE; $p_(H_2)$ = 1 atm   (A) Sn undergoes oxidation (B) $H^(+)$ undergoes reduction (C) $Sn^(2+)$ undergoes reduction (D) No net reaction ","To determine which of the given options is true for the electrochemical reaction provided, we need to consider the conditions given and the standard reduction potentials.

The electrochemical reaction is:
\[ \text{Sn} + 2H^+ \rightarrow \text{Sn}^{2+} + H_2 \]

Given that the standard reduction potential for the half-reaction involving tin is:
\[ \text{Sn}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Sn} \quad E^\circ = -0.136 \text{ V vs. SHE} \]

We also have the pH of the solution, which is 5, and the concentration of \(\text{Sn}^{2+}\) ions, which is \(10^{-2}\) M. The partial pressure of \(H_2\) is 1 atm.

Let's analyze the options:

(A) Sn undergoes oxidation - This is true. Tin (Sn) is losing electrons to form \(\text{Sn}^{2+}\), which is the definition of oxidation.

(B) \(H^+\) undergoes reduction - This is true. Hydrogen ions (\(H^+\)) are gaining electrons to form hydrogen gas (\(H_2\)), which is the definition of reduction.

(C) \(\text{Sn}^{2+}\) undergoes reduction - This is false. \(\text{Sn}^{2+}\) is already in its oxidized state and does not undergo further reduction in this reaction.

(D) No net reaction - This is false. There is a net reaction occurring as indicated by the equation provided.

Given the conditions of the solution (pH 5 and \([\text{Sn}^{2+}] = 10^{-2}\) M), we need to determine if the reaction will proceed spontaneously. To do this, we can calculate the cell potential under these conditions using the Nernst equation:

\[ E_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cell}} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q \]

Where:
- \(E^\circ_{\text{cell}}\) is the standard cell potential
- \(R\) is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K))
- \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K)
- \(n\) is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2 for this reaction)
- \(F\) is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol)
- \(Q\) is the reaction quotient

The standard cell potential \(E^\circ_{\text{cell}}\) can be calculated by combining the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:

\[ E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}} \]

For the reduction of \(H^+\) to \(H_2\), the standard reduction potential is 0 V versus SHE (since it's the standard hydrogen electrode). Therefore, \(E^\circ_{\text{cell}}\) is:

\[ E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = 0 \text{ V} - (-0.136 \text{ V}) = 0.136 \text{ V} \]

The reaction quotient \(Q\) is given by:

\[ Q = \frac{[\text{Sn}^{2+}]}{[\text{H}^+]^2} = \frac{10^{-2}}{(10^{-5})^2} = 10^8 \]

Now we can calculate the cell potential \(E_{\text{cell}}\):

\[ E_{\text{cell}} = 0.136 \text{ V} - \frac{(8.314 \text{ J/(mol·K)}) \times 298 \text{ K}}{2 \times 96485 \text{ C/mol}} \ln (10^8) \]

\[ E_{\text{cell}} = 0.136 \text{ V} - \frac{0.05916 \text{ V}}{2} \times 8 \ln (10) \]

\[ E_{\text{cell}} = 0.136 \text{ V} - 0.23664 \text{ V} \times 8 \]

The Nernst equation for a general redox reaction at temperature T is given by:

\[ E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q \]

where:
- \( E \) is the cell potential at non-standard conditions,
- \( E^\circ \) is the standard cell potential (for the reaction when all reactants and products are at unit activity),
- \( R \) is the gas constant (8.314 J \( mol^{-1}K^{-1} \)),

- \( n \) is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction,
- \( F \) is Faraday's constant (96500 C \( mol^{-1} \)),
- \( Q \) is the reaction quotient, which in this case is the activity of the impure copper \( a_{Cu} \).

For the electrolytic refining of copper, the reaction can be represented as:

\[ Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu \]

Here, \( n = 2 \) because two electrons are transferred for each copper ion that is reduced to copper metal.

Given that the activity of impure copper \( a_{Cu} \) = 0.9, and we are assuming that pure copper has an activity of 1 (since the standard state is the Raoultian standard state), we can set \( Q = a_{Cu} = 0.9 \).

We are looking for the voltage required to refine the copper, which means we are looking for the difference in potential between the impure copper and pure copper. Since \( E^\circ \) is the standard potential for the reaction, which is zero in this case because we are considering the same substance in its standard state, the equation simplifies to:

\[ E = 0 - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln(a_{Cu}) \]

Now we can plug in the values:

\[ E = - \frac{(8.314 \, J \, mol^{-1}K^{-1})(300 \, K)}{(2)(96500 \, C \, mol^{-1})} \ln(0.9) \]

\[ E = - \frac{(8.314)(300)}{(2)(96500)} \ln(0.9) \]

The concentrate is leached by sulphuric acid and electrolyzed in 10 cells arranged in series. The minimum current rating (Ampere per month per cell, rounded off to the nearest integer) is?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum current required to process the given amount of copper concentrate. We will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of copper (in grams) in the concentrate.
2. Determine the moles of copper that corresponds to.
3. Calculate the total charge (in coulombs) required to process all the copper.
4. Determine the total time available for electrolysis.
5. Calculate the minimum current rating per cell.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of copper in the concentrate.
The copper concentrate contains 21 wt.% Cu. The total amount of copper is:

100 metric tons of concentrate * 21% Cu * 1000 kg/metric ton * 1000 g/kg = 2100000 g of Cu

Step 2: Determine the moles of copper.
Using the atomic weight of copper (63 g/mol), the moles of copper are:

2100000 g of Cu / 63 g/mol = 3333333.33 mol of Cu (approximately)

Step 3: Calculate the total charge required.
According to Faraday's laws of electrolysis, 1 mole of copper requires 2 moles of electrons (since copper is reduced from Cu^2+ to Cu). Using Faraday's constant (96500 C/mol of electrons), the total charge required is:

3333333.33 mol of Cu * 2 mol of e^-/mol of Cu * 96500 C/mol of e^- = 640000000000 C

Step 4: Determine the total time available for electrolysis.
6 months with 25 working days per month and 8 working hours per day gives us:

6 months * 25 days/month * 8 hours/day = 1200 hours

Step 5: Calculate the minimum current rating per cell.
Since the cells are arranged in series, the total current will be the same through each cell. The current (I) is the charge (Q) divided by the time (t):

I = Q / t
I = 6400000000000 C / 1200 hours
I ≈ 53333333.33 A

However, this is the total current for all cells. We need to find the current per cell. Since there are 10 cells in series:

Current per cell = Total current / Number of cells
Current per cell ≈ 53333333.33 A / 10 cells
Current per cell ≈ 5333333.33 A/cell

Now, we need to find the current per cell per month. Assuming the current is evenly distributed over the 6 months:

Current per cell per month = Current per cell / 6 months
Current per cell per month ≈ 5333333.33 A/cell / 6 months
Current per cell per month ≈ 888888.89 A/cell/month

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the minimum current rating per cell per month is 888889 A.

- \( a_{Cu,anode} \) is the activity of copper at the anode (0.8 for the alloy).

Given that pure copper has an activity of 1, the Nernst equation simplifies to:

\[ E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.8}\right) \]

The standard cell potential \( E^\circ \) for the electrolytic refining of copper is not given, but since we are dealing with the same substance at both electrodes (copper), the standard cell potential under these conditions would be zero because there is no net chemical reaction occurring. Therefore, \( E^\circ = 0 \) V.

Now we can calculate the cell potential \( E \):

\[ E = 0 - \frac{(8.314 \text{ J/(mol·K)}) \times (298.15 \text{ K})}{2 \times 96500 \text{ C/mol}} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.8}\right) \]

The standard electrode potential for the oxidation of Ni to Ni^2+ (E°_ox) is the negative of the reduction potential, so it is approximately -0.257 V at 25°C.

However, since the temperature is given as 300 K (not 25°C), we need to consider the temperature dependence of the electrode potential. The Nernst equation can be used to calculate the electrode potential at a temperature other than the standard condition:

E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)

where:
- E is the electrode potential at the given temperature and concentration,
- E° is the standard electrode potential,
- R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1),
- T is the temperature in Kelvin,
- n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2 for Ni^2+/Ni),
- F is the Faraday constant (96490 C mol^-1),
- Q is the reaction quotient.

Since we are considering the standard potential at a different temperature, Q = 1 for a standard state, and ln(1) = 0, so the second term drops out. Thus, the electrode potential at 300 K is essentially the same as at 25°C for the standard conditions.

The minimum voltage (V_min) required for electrolytic refining is the sum of the absolute values of the anode and cathode potentials:

V_min = |E°_ox| + |E°_red|
V_min = |-0.257 V| + |+0.257 V|
V_min = 0.257 V + 0.257 V
V_min = 0.514 V

To convert this to millivolts, we multiply by 1000:

V_min = 0.514 V * 1000 mV/V = 514 mV

Therefore, the absolute value of the minimum voltage required for refining is:

Electrical,29,G-META-17-40,NUM,43,"Given: Atomic weight of Zn = 65. A zinc electrowinning cell is being operated at a current of 400A, voltage of 3.5V, and a cathodic current efficiency of 90%. The specific energy consumption (in $kJ.kg^(-1) zinc) is? (answer up to two decimal places)","To calculate the specific energy consumption for the electrowinning of zinc, we need to consider the amount of zinc produced, the energy consumed in producing that zinc, and the efficiency of the process.

First, let's calculate the amount of zinc produced in moles per second:

The reaction at the cathode for zinc deposition is:
\[ Zn^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Zn \]

This tells us that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of zinc.

Given the current (I) of 400 A (coulombs per second) and the charge of an electron (e) being \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \) C (coulombs), we can calculate the moles of electrons per second:

\[ \text{Moles of electrons per second} = \frac{I}{e \times N_A} \]
\[ \text{where } N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1} \text{ (Avogadro's number)} \]

\[ \text{Moles of electrons per second} = \frac{400 \text{ A}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}} \]
\[ \text{Moles of electrons per second} = \frac{400}{1.602 \times 6.022} \text{ mol/s} \]
\[ \text{Moles of electrons per second} \approx \frac{400}{9.631} \text{ mol/s} \]
\[ \text{Moles of electrons per second} \approx 41.50 \text{ mol/s} \]

Since 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of zinc, the moles of zinc produced per second is half the moles of electrons:

\[ \text{Moles of zinc per second} = \frac{41.50 \text{ mol/s}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Moles of zinc per second} = 20.75 \text{ mol/s} \]

Now, let's calculate the mass of zinc produced per second:

\[ \text{Mass of zinc per second} = \text{Moles of zinc per second} \times \text{Atomic weight of Zn} \]
\[ \text{Mass of zinc per second} = 20.75 \text{ mol/s} \times 65 \text{ g/mol} \]
\[ \text{Mass of zinc per second} = 1348.75 \text{ g/s} \]
\[ \text{Mass of zinc per second} = 1.34875 \text{ kg/s} \]

Next, we calculate the energy consumed per second (power):

\[ \text{Power} = \text{Current} \times \text{Voltage} \]
\[ \text{Power} = 400 \text{ A} \times 3.5 \text{ V} \]
\[ \text{Power} = 1400 \text{ W} \]
\[ \text{Power} = 1400 \text{ J/s} \]

Considering the cathodic current efficiency (\( \eta \)) of 90%, the effective power used for zinc deposition is:

\[ \text{Effective power} = \text{Power} \times \eta \]
\[ \text{Effective power} = 1400 \text{ J/s} \times 0.90 \]
\[ \text{Effective power} = 1260 \text{ J/s} \]

Finally, we calculate the specific energy consumption, which is the energy consumed per kilogram of zinc produced:

\[ \text{Specific energy consumption} = \frac{\text{Effective power}}{\text{Mass of zinc per second}} \]
\[ \text{Specific energy consumption} = \frac{1260 \text{ J/s}}{1.34875 \text{ kg/s}} \]
\[ \text{Specific energy consumption} \approx 934.",,,0,

A galvanic cell is formed by connecting Zn($E°_(Zn^(+2)/Zn)$ = -0.76 V) and Fe($E°_(Fe^(+2)/Fe)$ = -0.44 V) wires immersed in their respective ion solutions. The cell discharges spontaneoulsy with a voltage of 0.5V. The ratio of the concentration of $[Fe^(+2)]$ to $[Zn^(+2)]$ ions in the cell is of the order of:  (A) $10^(-6)$ (B) $10^(-5)$ (C) $10^(6)$ (D) $10^(7)$","To find the ratio of the concentration of $[Fe^{2+}]$ to $[Zn^{2+}]$ ions in the cell, we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the cell potential under non-standard conditions to the standard cell potential and the reaction quotient Q.

The Nernst equation for a general redox reaction of the form $aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$ is given by:

\[ E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q \]

where:
- \( E \) is the cell potential under non-standard conditions,
- \( E^\circ \) is the standard cell potential,
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (8.314 \( J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1} \)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K),
- \( n \) is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction,
- \( F \) is the Faraday constant (96500 \( C.mol^{-1} \)),
- \( Q \) is the reaction quotient, which for our reaction is \( \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \).

The reaction taking place in the cell is:

\[ Zn(s) + Fe^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + Fe(s) \]

The standard cell potential \( E^\circ \) can be calculated from the standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions:

\[ E^\circ_{cell} = E^\circ_{Fe^{2+}/Fe} - E^\circ_{Zn^{2+}/Zn} \]
\[ E^\circ_{cell} = (-0.44 V) - (-0.76 V) = 0.32 V \]

The actual cell potential \( E \) is given as 0.5 V. Since the cell operates spontaneously, \( E \) should be less than \( E^\circ \) if the reaction is written as a reduction. However, in this case, the actual cell potential is greater than the standard cell potential, which suggests that the reaction is occurring in the direction of zinc oxidation and iron reduction, which is consistent with the spontaneous discharge of the cell.

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the ratio \( \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \):

\[ 0.5 V = 0.32 V - \frac{(8.314 J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1})(298 K)}{(2)(96500 C.mol^{-1})} \ln \left( \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \right) \]

\[ 0.5 V = 0.32 V - \frac{(8.314)(298)}{(2)(96500)} \ln \left( \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \right) \]

\[ 0.18 V = \frac{(8.314)(298)}{(2)(96500)} \ln \left( \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \right) \]

\[ \ln \left( \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \right) = \frac{0.18 V (2)(96500)}{(8.314)(298)} \]

\[ \ln \left( \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \right) = \frac{0.18 \times 2 \times 96500}{8.314 \times 298} \]

Now, let's calculate the value inside the logarithm:

\[ \ln \left( \frac{[Fe^{2+}]}{[Zn^{2+}]} \right) = \frac{0.18 \times 2 \times 96500}{8.314 \times 298} \approx 13.83 \]

To find the ratio, we need to exponentiate both sides of the equation:

Iron is corroding in fresh water which has dissolved oxygen concentration of 15mM. The anodic current density(in $A.cm^(-2)$) at an overpotential of 120 mV is?(round off to three decimal places).,"To solve this problem, we can use the Tafel equation, which relates the overpotential (η) to the current density (i) for an electrode reaction. The Tafel equation is given by:

η = a + b log(i)

where:
- η is the overpotential (in volts),
- a is the Tafel constant (in volts),
- b is the Tafel slope (in volts per decade of current density),
- i is the current density (in A/cm²).

Given:
- Anodic Tafel slope (b) = 0.06 V/decade
- Overpotential (η) = 120 mV = 0.12 V

We need to find the anodic current density (i). Rearranging the Tafel equation to solve for i gives us:

i = 10^((η - a) / b)

However, we do not have the value of the Tafel constant (a). In practice, the Tafel constant is determined experimentally, but since we do not have this value, we will assume that the Tafel equation passes through the origin, which is a common assumption when the overpotential is sufficiently high. This means we are assuming a = 0. This is a simplification and may not be accurate for all systems, but it will allow us to proceed with the calculation.

With a = 0, the equation simplifies to:

i = 10^(η / b)

Now we can plug in the values:

i = 10^(0.12 V / 0.06 V/decade)
i = 10^(2)
i = 100 A/cm²

However, this result seems unreasonably high for a corrosion current density. It is likely that the assumption a = 0 is not valid in this case, and we would need the actual value of the Tafel constant a to calculate the correct current density.

Since we do not have the value of a and cannot proceed with the calculation without it, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the question as stated. The correct approach would be to obtain the value of the Tafel constant a from experimental data or from additional information provided in the context, which is currently not available.

Charge of electron is 1.6 * $10^(-19)A.s$ 5. Mobility of electron is 0.2 $m^(2).V^(-1).s^(-1)$. Zone refining of Si results in residual P content of 0.1 parts per billion by weight. The electrical conductivity($Ω^(-1).m^(-1)$) of this Zone refined Si is?(round off to two decimal places).,"To calculate the electrical conductivity of the zone-refined silicon with residual phosphorus content, we need to consider the charge carriers provided by the phosphorus impurities. Since phosphorus is a pentavalent element, it acts as a donor in silicon, providing extra electrons for conduction.

Here's the step-by-step process to calculate the conductivity:

1. Calculate the number of phosphorus atoms per unit volume of silicon:
   - Given the density of silicon (ρ_Si) is 2.33 g/cm³, we can convert this to kg/m³ by multiplying by 1000 (to convert grams to kilograms) and dividing by 10⁶ (to convert cubic centimeters to cubic meters), which gives us ρ_Si = 2330 kg/m³.
   - The atomic weight of phosphorus (M_P) is 30.97 g/mol. To convert this to kg/mol, we divide by 1000, giving us M_P = 0.03097 kg/mol.
   - Using Avogadro's number (N_A = 6.02 × 10²³ atoms/mol), we can find the mass of a single phosphorus atom: m_P = M_P / N_A.
   - The concentration of phosphorus by weight is 0.1 parts per billion (ppb), which is 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ g of P per g of Si. To convert this to kg of P per kg of Si, we divide by 1000 and get 1 × 10⁻¹² kg/kg.
   - The number of phosphorus atoms per unit volume (n_P) is then given by: n_P = (ρ_Si × concentration of P) / m_P.

2. Calculate the number of free electrons per unit volume:
   - Since each phosphorus atom donates one electron, the number of free electrons per unit volume (n_e) is equal to n_P.

3. Calculate the electrical conductivity (σ):
   - The conductivity is given by σ = n_e × q × μ_e, where q is the charge of an electron (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) and μ_e is the mobility of an electron in silicon (0.2 m²/V/s).

Now, let's perform the calculations:

1. Mass of a single phosphorus atom:
   m_P = 0.03097 kg/mol / 6.02 × 10²³ atoms/mol = 5.14 × 10⁻²⁶ kg/atom.

2. Number of phosphorus atoms per unit volume:
   n_P = (2330 kg/m³ × 1 × 10⁻¹² kg/kg) / 5.14 × 10⁻²⁶ kg/atom = 4.53 × 10¹⁸ atoms/m³.

3. Number of free electrons per unit volume:
   n_e = n_P = 4.53 × 10¹⁸ electrons/m³.

4. Electrical conductivity:
   σ = n_e × q × μ_e = 4.53 × 10¹⁸ electrons/m³ × 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C × 0.2 m²/V/s = 1.45 × 10⁻¹⁸ Ω⁻¹/m.

Rounded to two decimal places, the electrical conductivity of the zone-refined silicon is:

For a reduction reaction at standard conditions (where $Q=1$), the Nernst equation simplifies to:

\[ E_{cell} = E°_{cell} \]

The standard cell potential is related to the Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G°$) for the reaction by the equation:

\[ \Delta G° = -nFE°_{cell} \]

where $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced reaction, $F$ is the Faraday constant (96500 C $mol^(-1)$), and $E°_{cell}$ is the standard cell potential.

For the reaction:

\[ Ni^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Ni \]

$n = 2$ (since two moles of electrons are transferred for each mole of $Ni^{2+}$ that is reduced to $Ni$).

Given that $E°_{cell}$ for the nickel reaction is -0.25 V, we can calculate $\Delta G°$:

\[ \Delta G° = -nFE°_{cell} \]
\[ \Delta G° = -2 \cdot 96500 \cdot (-0.25) \]
\[ \Delta G° = 2 \cdot 96500 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ \Delta G° = 48250 \text{ J } mol^(-1) \]

The standard Gibbs free energy of formation ($\Delta G°_f$) for $Ni^{2+}$ is equal to the $\Delta G°$ for the reaction because the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for solid nickel ($Ni$) is zero (since it is a pure element in its standard state). Therefore, $\Delta G°_f(Ni^{2+})$ is +48250 J $mol^(-1)$.

The standard chemical potential ($\mu°$) for $Ni^{2+}$ is the same as $\Delta G°_f(Ni^{2+})$ because the chemical potential is the partial molar free energy.

Thus, the standard chemical potential for $Ni^{2+}$ at 298 K is:

\[ \mu°(Ni^{2+}) = \Delta G°_f(Ni^{2+}) \]
\[ \mu°(Ni^{2+}) = +48250 \text{ J } mol^(-1) \]

\[ \mu°(Ni^{2+}) = 48250 \text{ J } mol^(-1) \]

- \( i_0 \) is the exchange current density (\( 10^{-9} \) A/cm²).

\[ E_{eq} = E_{H^+/H_2}^0 - \frac{RT}{F} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{a_{H^+}}{P_{H_2}^{1/2}}\right) \]

- \( P_{H_2} \) is the partial pressure of hydrogen gas (assumed to be 1 atm for standard conditions).

Since \( P_{H_2} = 1 \) atm, \( P_{H_2}^{1/2} = 1 \), and the equation simplifies to:

\[ E_{eq} = 0 - \frac{8.314 \cdot 298.15}{96500} \cdot \ln(10^{-3}) \]

\[ E_{eq} = -\frac{8.314 \cdot 298.15}{96500} \cdot (-3 \cdot \ln(10)) \]

\[ E_{eq} = -\frac{8.314 \cdot 298.15}{96500} \cdot (-3 \cdot 2.303) \]

\[ E_{eq} = 0.05915 \cdot 3 \cdot 2.303 \]

\[ E^\circ = 1.2327 - \frac{(8.314)(873)(0.693)}{193000} \]

Now we calculate the value:

\[ E^\circ = 1.2327 - \frac{(8.314)(873)(0.693)}{193000} \]

\[ E^\circ = 1.2327 - \frac{4657.567}{193000} \]

(P) Quenching: This process involves rapidly cooling a material from a high temperature, often by immersing it in water, oil, or other fluids. Quenching is primarily used to harden steel.

(Q) Annealing: Annealing is a heat treatment process that softens the metal, making it more workable. It involves heating the metal to a specific temperature and then cooling it at a suitable rate. Annealing can also relieve internal stresses and improve ductility.

(R) Tempering: Tempering is performed after quenching to reduce the brittleness and increase the toughness of the steel. It involves reheating the quenched steel to a temperature below the critical point, followed by cooling.

(A) Higher the amount of cold work, lower is the recrystallization temperature (B) Higher the recovery, higher is the recrystallization temperature (C) Higher the temperature of cold work, higher is the recrystallization temperature (D) Finer the initial grain size, higher is the recrystallization temperature","To answer the question regarding which statement about recrystallization is NOT correct, let's analyze each option:

(A) Higher the amount of cold work, lower is the recrystallization temperature.
This statement is generally correct. Increased cold work introduces more dislocations and defects into the material, which lowers the energy required for recrystallization to occur, thus reducing the recrystallization temperature.

(B) Higher the recovery, higher is the recrystallization temperature.
This statement is incorrect. Recovery is a process that occurs prior to recrystallization where dislocations rearrange themselves into lower energy configurations, such as sub-grain boundaries, without the formation of new strain-free grains. Higher recovery typically leads to a higher recrystallization temperature because some of the stored energy in the material is released during recovery, making it harder for new grains to nucleate. Therefore, this statement is counterintuitive to the actual process.

(C) Higher the temperature of cold work, higher is the recrystallization temperature.
This statement is generally incorrect. The temperature at which cold work is performed is typically low enough that it does not cause recrystallization during the deformation process. Instead, the temperature of the material after cold working can affect recrystallization. If the material is heated to a higher temperature after cold working, recrystallization can occur at a lower temperature because the atoms have more thermal energy to rearrange into new grains.

(D) Finer the initial grain size, higher is the recrystallization temperature.
This statement is generally correct. A finer initial grain size means that there are more grain boundaries, which are high-energy regions. These grain boundaries can act as nucleation sites for recrystallization, thus a finer grain size typically leads to recrystallization occurring at a lower temperature because less energy is required for nucleation.

Based on the analysis, the statement that is NOT correct is:

- (C) Higher the temperature of cold work, higher is the recrystallization temperature.

However, since the question asks for the statement that is NOT correct and the explanation provided for option (C) is not aligned with the typical understanding of recrystallization, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the explanation of option (C). The correct explanation for option (C) should be that the temperature of cold work itself does not directly set the recrystallization temperature; rather, it is the amount of cold work (strain) imposed at that temperature that influences the recrystallization temperature. Therefore, the temperature of cold work is not the determining factor for the recrystallization temperature.

Assertion (a): During rolling, front tension and (or) back tension are (is) employed to decrease rolling load.

Explanation: In the context of rolling processes, front tension refers to the tension applied to the strip before it enters the rollers, while back tension is the tension applied after the material exits the rollers. The use of front and/or back tension can indeed reduce the rolling load. Front tension helps by reducing the incoming material's yield strength, making it easier to deform. Back tension, on the other hand, helps by elongating the material as it comes out of the rollers, which can also reduce the load required for rolling. Therefore, the assertion is true.

Reason (r): Roll pressure decreases due to lowering of flow stress as a result of front tension/back tension.

Explanation: The reason provided is also true. The application of front and/or back tension during rolling can lower the flow stress of the material. Flow stress is the stress required to continue deforming a material plastically. By applying tension, the effective stress needed for rolling is reduced because the tension aids in the deformation process. This reduction in flow stress leads to a decrease in the roll pressure needed to achieve the desired deformation, making the rolling process more efficient.

Now, we need to assess the relationship between the Assertion and the Reason:

The correctness of the Assertion is supported by the Reason. The decrease in rolling load (Assertion) is indeed due to the decrease in roll pressure as a result of the lowering of flow stress by the application of front tension and/or back tension (Reason). Therefore, the Reason is the correct explanation for the Assertion.

- The Assertion is true.
- The Reason is true.
- The Reason correctly explains the Assertion.

- Q. Earing: This is a defect that occurs in sheet metal forming processes where the material forms a wavy, ear-like edge. It is typically associated with deep drawing processes.

- Q. Earing is associated with deep drawing (3), which is a sheet metal forming process that can cause this type of defect.

- R. Alligatoring can be associated with rolling (1), as it can be caused by defects in the rolled material or improper rolling practices.

- S. Shrinkage porosity is a defect that occurs during the solidification of castings, which is not directly related to mechanical working processes but is a common defect in fusion welding (4) due to the solidification of the weld pool.

(A) Nitriding: Nitriding is a heat treatment process that introduces nitrogen into the surface of a steel component. This creates a hard, wear-resistant surface layer that can improve the fatigue life of the component by preventing crack initiation and slowing crack propagation.

(B) Decarburization: Decarburization is the loss of carbon from the surface of a steel component, which typically occurs during heating processes. This results in a softer surface layer that is less resistant to fatigue. Decarburization generally decreases the fatigue life of a steel component because it reduces the strength and hardness of the surface.

(C) Improving surface finish: A better surface finish can reduce the number and severity of surface defects and stress concentrations, which can serve as initiation sites for fatigue cracks. Therefore, improving the surface finish can enhance the fatigue life of a steel component.

(D) Shot-peening: Shot-peening is a cold working process in which a surface is bombarded with small spherical media called shot. This process induces compressive residual stresses in the surface layer, which can significantly improve the fatigue life of a component by delaying the initiation and growth of fatigue cracks.

where:
- \( V \) is the voltage in volts (V)
- \( I \) is the current in amperes (A)
- \( S \) is the welding speed in meters per minute (m/min)

Given:
- \( V = 20 \) V
- \( I = 200 \) A

\[ S = 0.01 \) m/s \( \times 60 \) s/min \( = 0.6 \) m/min

Now we can plug the values into the formula:

\[ Heat\ Input\ (kJ/m) = \frac{20 \times 200 \times 60}{0.6 \times 1000} \]
\[ Heat\ Input\ (kJ/m) = \frac{240,000}{600} \]

(A) Reducing carbon content (B) Increasing carbon content (C) Eliminating strong carbide formers (D) Decreasing chromium content,"Weld decay, also known as intergranular corrosion, in austenitic stainless steels is a problem that occurs due to the sensitization of the steel in the heat-affected zone during welding. Sensitization happens when chromium carbides precipitate at the grain boundaries, depleting the chromium content in the surrounding area and reducing the steel's corrosion resistance.

To avoid weld decay in austenitic stainless steels, the following measures can be taken:

(A) Reducing carbon content - Lowering the carbon content reduces the amount of chromium carbide that can form, thereby minimizing the depletion of chromium at the grain boundaries. This is an effective way to prevent weld decay.

(B) Increasing carbon content - This would typically increase the amount of chromium carbide formed and exacerbate the problem of chromium depletion, making weld decay more likely.

(C) Eliminating strong carbide formers - Elements like titanium and niobium are strong carbide formers and can combine with carbon to form stable carbides, which can prevent chromium from forming chromium carbides. This stabilizes the microstructure against sensitization.

(D) Decreasing chromium content - Decreasing the chromium content would generally reduce the corrosion resistance of the stainless steel, as chromium is the key element that provides corrosion resistance. This is not a solution to prevent weld decay.

If the height of the green sample was 12 mm, then the fill height of powder (in mm) would have been?","To solve this problem, we can use the principle of mass conservation. The mass of the powder before and after compaction remains the same. Therefore, the volume of the powder before compaction (fill height) can be related to the volume of the green sample after compaction.

Let's denote:
- \( \rho_{\text{apparent}} \) as the apparent density of the metal powder before compaction,
- \( \rho_{\text{green}} \) as the green density of the metal powder after compaction,
- \( V_{\text{fill}} \) as the volume of the powder before compaction (fill volume),
- \( V_{\text{green}} \) as the volume of the green sample after compaction,
- \( h_{\text{fill}} \) as the fill height of the powder before compaction,
- \( h_{\text{green}} \) as the height of the green sample after compaction.

Given:
- \( \rho_{\text{apparent}} = 2.5 \text{ g/cm}^3 \),
- \( \rho_{\text{green}} = 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3 \),
- \( h_{\text{green}} = 12 \text{ mm} \).

We can find the volume of the green sample (\( V_{\text{green}} \)) using its density and mass (which is the same before and after compaction):
\[ V_{\text{green}} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\rho_{\text{green}}} \]

Since we don't have the mass directly, we can express the mass in terms of the apparent density and the fill volume (\( V_{\text{fill}} \)):
\[ \text{mass} = \rho_{\text{apparent}} \times V_{\text{fill}} \]

Substituting \( V_{\text{fill}} \) with \( \frac{\text{mass}}{\rho_{\text{apparent}}} \), we get:
\[ V_{\text{green}} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\rho_{\text{green}}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{apparent}} \times V_{\text{fill}}}{\rho_{\text{green}}} \]

We know that \( V_{\text{fill}} \) is the volume of the powder before compaction, which can be calculated by the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ V_{\text{fill}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{fill}} \]

And similarly, \( V_{\text{green}} \) is the volume of the green sample after compaction:
\[ V_{\text{green}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{green}} \]

Since the radius \( r \) of the cylinder does not change during compaction, we can equate the two volumes and solve for \( h_{\text{fill}} \):
\[ \pi r^2 h_{\text{fill}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{apparent}}}{\rho_{\text{green}}} \times \pi r^2 h_{\text{green}} \]

Canceling out \( \pi r^2 \) from both sides, we get:
\[ h_{\text{fill}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{apparent}}}{\rho_{\text{green}}} \times h_{\text{green}} \]

Now we can plug in the given values:
\[ h_{\text{fill}} = \frac{2.5 \text{ g/cm}^3}{5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3} \times 12 \text{ mm} \]

\[ h_{\text{fill}} = \frac{1}{2.2} \times 12 \text{ mm} \]

\[ h_{\text{fill}} = \frac{12}{2.2} \text{ mm} \]

\[ h_{\text{fill}} \approx 5.45 \text{ mm} \]

(A) a is true but r is false (B) a is false but r is true (C) both a and r are true, and r is the reason for a (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a","To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts involved in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), also known as tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, and the properties of aluminum alloys.

Assertion (a): During welding of aluminium alloys by the gas tungsten arc welding process, direct current reverse polarity (DCRP) mode is used.

This assertion is true. In gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) of aluminum alloys, direct current reverse polarity (DCRP) is commonly used. In DCRP, the welding torch is connected to the positive terminal of the power supply, and the workpiece is connected to the negative terminal. This setup provides a number of benefits when welding aluminum, such as deeper penetration and easier arc starting. It also helps in minimizing the cleaning action that is less desirable with aluminum due to its tenacious oxide layer.

Reason (r): DCRP facilitates breaking up of the oxide film on the workpiece surface.

This reason is false. While DCRP is used for aluminum welding, it does not primarily facilitate breaking up of the oxide film on the workpiece surface. Instead, the oxide film on aluminum is typically broken by mechanical cleaning (e.g., wire brushing, scraping) before welding. The choice of DCRP in GTAW is more about the advantages it provides in terms of heat distribution and arc stability rather than oxide film removal. The oxide layer on aluminum is conductive, and the heat generated by the welding process can help to disrupt this layer during welding, but this is not the primary reason for using DCRP.

(A) Ultrasonic welding (B) Friction welding (C) Diffusion bonding (D) Electroslag welding,"To answer the question, we need to understand the solid state metal joining techniques and then identify the one that does not belong to this category.

Solid state welding processes are those in which the metal does not reach its melting point during the joining process. Here are the processes listed and whether they are solid state or not:

(A) Ultrasonic welding - This is a solid state process where high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are applied to materials being held together under pressure to create a solid-state weld.

(B) Friction welding - This is also a solid state process where the heat required to join the metals is generated by the friction between the surfaces to be welded.

(C) Diffusion bonding - This is a solid state process that involves the joining of metals through the application of heat and pressure, allowing atoms to diffuse across the interface of the materials.

(D) Electroslag welding - Unlike the other three, electroslag welding is not a solid state process. It involves the melting of a consumable electrode and the workpieces to form a weld pool, which then solidifies to create the weld. The process involves the use of molten slag to protect the weld area, and it is considered a fusion welding process.

Assertion [a]: In a pure metal weld, the elastic modulus in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) is the same as that in the base metal.

The elastic modulus of a metal is a fundamental property that is generally independent of microstructural changes such as grain size. It is primarily determined by the atomic bonding within the metal and is not significantly affected by processes like welding, which cause changes in the microstructure. Therefore, the elastic modulus in the HAZ should be approximately the same as that in the base metal, assuming the chemical composition remains unchanged.

Reason [r]: Coarse grained microstructure in the HAZ results in lower hardness.

The microstructure of a metal does influence its hardness. In general, a coarser grain structure can lead to lower hardness because larger grains can be less effective at hindering dislocation movement, which is one of the mechanisms that contribute to strength and hardness. However, hardness is not directly related to the elastic modulus. The elastic modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a material, which is how much a material will deform under stress, while hardness is a measure of how resistant a material is to permanent deformation.

Given the above analysis:

- Assertion [a] is true because the elastic modulus is primarily a function of the atomic structure and bonding, which do not change significantly due to welding in a pure metal.
- Reason [r] is true because a coarse-grained microstructure typically does result in lower hardness due to the ease of dislocation movement within larger grains.

However, the reason [r] does not explain the assertion [a]. The hardness of the material is not related to its elastic modulus, so the fact that the HAZ has a coarser grain structure and therefore lower hardness does not explain why the elastic modulus remains unchanged.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Both [a] and [r] are true and [r] is not the correct reason for [a].

The width of the heat-affected zone in decreasing order is  (A) P > Q > R (B) Q > R > P (C) R > P > Q (D) P > R > Q ,"The width of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) in welding processes is influenced by several factors, including the heat input, the type of heat source, and the cooling rate. Generally, processes that introduce more heat into the workpiece will have a wider HAZ. Let's consider the three processes mentioned:

1. **Laser Beam Welding (P)**: This process uses a highly concentrated beam of light to melt and join metals. The heat input is very localized, and the process has a very high energy density. This results in a narrow HAZ compared to traditional welding methods.

2. **Submerged Arc Welding (Q)**: This process uses a consumable electrode and a blanket of granular fusible flux. The arc is submerged under the flux, which makes it difficult to see, but it also creates a more stable arc and minimizes spatter. The heat input is relatively high, leading to a wider HAZ compared to laser beam welding.

3. **Metal Inert Gas Welding (R)**, also known as MIG welding: This process uses a wire electrode that is continuously fed through a welding gun and an inert gas, or a mix of inert and active gases, to shield the weld area from contamination. The heat input is moderate, and the HAZ is typically wider than laser beam welding but narrower than submerged arc welding.

Based on the above information, the width of the heat-affected zone in decreasing order would be:

The density of the as-pressed aluminium compact is 1755 kg.$m^(-3)$. If the height of the as-pressed compact is 12 mm, the fill height (in mm) required is?","To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of mass. The mass of aluminum powder that fills the die initially is the same as the mass of the as-pressed compact. We can set up the following relationship:

Mass of powder = Mass of compact

Since mass is density times volume, we have:

\[ \rho_{\text{powder}} \times V_{\text{powder}} = \rho_{\text{compact}} \times V_{\text{compact}} \]

Given:
- Apparent density of powder, \(\rho_{\text{powder}} = 810 \, kg/m^3\)
- Density of compact, \(\rho_{\text{compact}} = 1755 \, kg/m^3\)
- Height of compact, \(h_{\text{compact}} = 12 \, mm = 0.012 \, m\)

We need to find the volume of the powder (which is the same as the volume of the compact before pressing) to determine the fill height. Let's assume the radius of the cylindrical die is \(r\). The volume of the compact is:

\[ V_{\text{compact}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{compact}} \]

The volume of the powder before compaction is:

\[ V_{\text{powder}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{powder}} \]

Where \(h_{\text{powder}}\) is the fill height we want to find. Now we can equate the mass expressions:

\[ \rho_{\text{powder}} \times \pi r^2 h_{\text{powder}} = \rho_{\text{compact}} \times \pi r^2 h_{\text{compact}} \]

Since \(\pi r^2\) is common to both sides, it cancels out, and we are left with:

\[ \rho_{\text{powder}} \times h_{\text{powder}} = \rho_{\text{compact}} \times h_{\text{compact}} \]

Now we can solve for \(h_{\text{powder}}\):

\[ h_{\text{powder}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{compact}} \times h_{\text{compact}}}{\rho_{\text{powder}}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ h_{\text{powder}} = \frac{1755 \, kg/m^3 \times 0.012 \, m}{810 \, kg/m^3} \]

\[ h_{\text{powder}} = \frac{21.06 \, kg/m^2}{810 \, kg/m^3} \]

\[ h_{\text{powder}} = 0.02599 \, m \]

\[ h_{\text{powder}} = 25.99 \, mm \]

So the fill height required is approximately 26 mm. Now, let's write the final answer in a list as requested:

(A) Gas Metal Arc Welding (B) Electro Slag Welding (C) Electron Beam Welding (D) Laser Beam Welding,"To answer the question, let's briefly describe each welding process and then determine which one is not suitable for joining thin metal sheets:

(A) Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) - Also known as MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding, this process uses a wire electrode that is continuously fed into the weld pool. It is versatile and can be used for thin sheets as well as thicker materials, but it requires careful control of heat input to avoid burn-through on very thin sheets.

(B) Electro Slag Welding (ESW) - This is a welding process used for joining thick, heavy sections of metals and alloys. It is not typically used for thin sheets because the high heat input and large weld pool can easily distort or burn through thin materials.

(C) Electron Beam Welding (EBW) - This is a precision welding process that uses a focused beam of high-velocity electrons to join materials. It is highly suitable for thin sheets because it produces a very narrow weld with deep penetration and minimal heat-affected zone.

(D) Laser Beam Welding (LBW) - Similar to EBW, this process uses a laser to create a very localized weld with minimal heat input. It is also highly suitable for thin sheets due to its precision and control, which minimize distortion and the risk of burn-through.

(A) Epoxy resins (B) Near-eutectic alloys (C) Refractory alloys (D) Large freezing range alloys,"Brazing is a metal-joining process where a filler metal is melted and drawn into a capillary formed by the assembly of two or more work pieces. The filler metal has a melting temperature below the work piece(s) melting temperature. When brazing steel sheets, the filler metal must be compatible with steel and be able to withstand the service conditions of the final product.

Given the options:

(A) Epoxy resins - These are not metallic and cannot be used for brazing, which is a metal-joining process.

(B) Near-eutectic alloys - These alloys have a very narrow melting range and are often used in soldering and brazing applications because they can create a strong joint without prolonged heating that could damage the base metal.

(C) Refractory alloys - These are alloys that are resistant to high temperatures and are often used in high-temperature applications. However, they may not be suitable for brazing steel if their melting point is not below the melting point of the steel.

(D) Large freezing range alloys - These alloys have a wide temperature range between their liquidus and solidus temperatures, which can lead to a longer time for the filler metal to solidify. This can be problematic in brazing applications because it can lead to joint weakness or distortion due to prolonged heating.

1. **Investment Casting (P)**: This process uses a wax pattern to create a mould, which is then melted away and replaced with metal. It is known for producing castings with very smooth surfaces.

2. **Permanent Mould Casting (Q)**: In this process, a reusable mould, typically made of metal, is used. The surface finish is generally smoother than sand casting but not as smooth as investment casting.

3. **Pressure Die Casting (R)**: This process forces molten metal into a mould under high pressure. It results in a very smooth surface finish and is typically better than permanent mould casting.

4. **Sand Casting (S)**: This is the most traditional form of casting, where a mould is made out of sand. It generally produces the roughest surface finish among the listed processes.

Arranging these processes from the smoothest to the roughest surface finish, we get:

- Investment Casting (P) produces the smoothest finish.
- Pressure Die Casting (R) produces a very smooth finish, typically smoother than Permanent Mould Casting.
- Permanent Mould Casting (Q) has a smoother finish than Sand Casting but rougher than Pressure Die Casting.

This defect is most commonly associated with:

(A) Extrusion - where materials are forced through a die to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile. Alligatoring can occur in extrusion when the material experiences excessive tensile stress, leading to cracking, often due to improper cooling or too high an extrusion speed.

(B) Deep drawing - a sheet metal forming process in which a sheet metal blank is drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. Alligatoring can happen in deep drawing if the material is overworked or if there is insufficient lubrication, leading to surface tearing and cracking.

(C) Sheet metal forming - a general process that includes various methods of deforming sheet metal into a desired shape. Alligatoring in sheet metal forming can occur due to similar reasons as in deep drawing, such as excessive deformation or poor lubrication.

(D) Rolling - a metalworking process in which metal stock is passed through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce the thickness and to make the thickness uniform. Alligatoring is less commonly associated with rolling, as the defects that occur in rolling are typically related to surface roughness, roll marks, or non-uniform thickness.

(C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains. (D) recrytallize at lower temeperatures,"The correct answer to the question is:

(C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains.

When a metal is heavily cold-worked, the dislocation density within the metal increases significantly. This increase in dislocation density raises the stored energy within the material, which provides the driving force for recrystallization. The high density of dislocations means that a larger number of nucleation sites are available for new recrystallized grains to form, but the energy barrier for nucleation is also higher due to the distorted lattice structure. This high energy barrier must be overcome for recrystallization to initiate.

The recrystallization process will typically result in a finer grain size because the high density of dislocations allows for more nucleation sites, leading to more grains forming during recrystallization. These new grains will have a lower dislocation density and thus a lower stored energy, which is the driving force for the recrystallization process.

Therefore, the correct answer, considering the energy barrier for nucleation, is (C).

Contribution to dilution of the weld pool is 20% from each plate. The Ni content(in wt.%) in the weld pool is?(round off to the nearest integer)","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the nickel (Ni) content in the weld pool based on the given compositions and the contribution to dilution from each plate.

First, let's determine the contribution of Ni from each plate to the weld pool:

- Plate 1 (Fe-10 wt.% Ni) contributes 20% of its Ni content to the weld pool.
  Ni from Plate 1 = 10 wt.% Ni * 20% = 2 wt.% Ni

- Plate 2 (Fe-20 wt.% Cr-5 wt.% Ni) contributes 20% of its Ni content to the weld pool.
  Ni from Plate 2 = 5 wt.% Ni * 20% = 1 wt.% Ni

Next, let's consider the contribution from the filler rod:

- Filler Rod (20 wt.% Ni-80 wt.% Cr) contributes 100% of its Ni content to the weld pool since it's the material being added.
  Ni from Filler Rod = 20 wt.% Ni * 100% = 20 wt.% Ni

Now, we add up the Ni contributions from both plates and the filler rod to find the total Ni content in the weld pool:

Total Ni in weld pool = Ni from Plate 1 + Ni from Plate 2 + Ni from Filler Rod
Total Ni in weld pool = 2 wt.% Ni + 1 wt.% Ni + 20 wt.% Ni
Total Ni in weld pool = 23 wt.% Ni

A continous fillet weld is made using a 3000 W welding machine. At a travel speed of 6 mm $s^(-1)$, the cross-sectional area(in $mm^2$) of the weld is?(round off to nearest integer)","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cross-sectional area of the weld bead based on the energy required to melt the metal, the heat transfer factor, the melting factor, the power of the welding machine, and the travel speed.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the energy available per unit time:**
   The welding machine provides 3000 W of power, which is equivalent to 3000 J/s.

2. **Calculate the energy required to melt the metal per unit length:**
   The unit energy required to melt the metal is given as 6 J/mm³. Since we are given a travel speed in mm/s, we need to consider the volume of metal melted per unit time. The travel speed is 6 mm/s, so the volume of metal melted per second is the travel speed multiplied by the cross-sectional area (A) of the weld, which is what we want to find.

   The energy required per second (E_req/s) is then:
   E_req/s = (Volume of metal melted per second) × (Energy required per unit volume)
   E_req/s = (A × travel speed) × (6 J/mm³)

3. **Account for the heat transfer factor and the melting factor:**
   Not all the energy from the welding machine is used efficiently to melt the metal. The heat transfer factor (0.6) accounts for the loss of energy in the process. The melting factor (0.5) accounts for the fraction of the transferred heat that is actually used to melt the metal (as opposed to raising its temperature or lost to the environment).

   The effective energy used to melt the metal per second (E_eff/s) is:
   E_eff/s = (E_req/s) × (Heat transfer factor) × (Melting factor)
   E_eff/s = (A × travel speed × 6 J/mm³) × 0.6 × 0.5

4. **Equate the effective energy to the energy provided by the welding machine:**
   The energy provided by the welding machine per second must equal the effective energy used to melt the metal per second:
   3000 J/s = (A × 6 mm/s × 6 J/mm³) × 0.6 × 0.5

5. **Solve for the cross-sectional area (A):**
   3000 J/s = A × 6 mm/s × 6 J/mm³ × 0.6 × 0.5
   3000 J/s = A × 18 J/s × 0.3
   A = 3000 J/s / (18 J/s × 0.3)
   A = 3000 / (10.8)
   A ≈ 277.78 mm²

(A) Arc welding (B) Gas welding (C) Resistance welding (D) Friction stir welding,"To answer the question, we need to understand the different types of welding processes and what distinguishes fusion welding from other types of welding.

Fusion welding is a process where the base metals are melted together to form a join. The heat for melting the metals can be provided by various sources, such as an electric arc, a gas flame, or other means. The key characteristic of fusion welding is that the metals being joined are melted to create the weld.

Let's consider each option:

(A) Arc welding - This is a type of fusion welding where an electric arc is used to melt the metals at the joint.

(B) Gas welding - Also known as oxy-fuel welding, this process uses a flame produced by the combustion of a fuel gas with oxygen to melt the metals. It is a fusion welding process.

(C) Resistance welding - This process involves the application of pressure and the passage of an electric current to produce heat at the interface of the metals being joined. While it does involve melting the metals, it is not typically classified as a fusion welding process because it relies on resistance to the flow of electric current as the primary source of heat, rather than an external heat source like a flame or arc.

(D) Friction stir welding - This is a solid-state welding process that does not involve melting the base metals. Instead, frictional heat is generated by a rotating tool that softens the metal, which is then stirred to form a weld. Since the metals are not melted, this is not a fusion welding process.

Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is:

- Resistance welding, because it is not classified as a fusion welding process, which requires the melting of the base metals. Instead, it uses the heat generated by the resistance to the flow of electric current.

Here are the factors from the options provided:

(A) Stick-out length: The stick-out length, which is the distance from the end of the contact tube to the tip of the consumable wire, affects the melting rate. A longer stick-out can lead to preheating of the wire, which can increase the melting rate.

(B) Welding speed: The speed at which the welder moves the torch along the joint affects how much wire is fed into the weld pool per unit of time. A higher welding speed can decrease the melting rate because less wire is melted per unit of length.

(C) Welding current: The welding current is a critical factor that directly influences the melting rate. A higher current increases the heat input, which in turn increases the melting rate of the wire.

(D) Diameter of the consumable wire: The diameter of the wire affects the cross-sectional area available to conduct current and therefore the amount of heat generated. A larger diameter wire can carry more current and may melt faster, but this also depends on the current setting and other factors.

The second weld is made at a welding speed of 0.0022 $m.s^(-1)$ with the same arc voltage. If both the welds have identical heat input, the welding current(in amperes) of the second weld is? (round off to the nearest integer). ","To solve this problem, we need to understand that the heat input during welding is a function of the welding current, arc voltage, and welding speed. The formula for heat input (H) in welding is given by:

\[ H = \eta \times V \times I / S \]

where:
- \( \eta \) is the arc heat transfer efficiency (0.65 in this case),
- \( V \) is the arc voltage (18 V for both welds),
- \( I \) is the welding current, and
- \( S \) is the welding speed.

Since the heat input for both welds is identical, we can set up the equation for the first weld and the second weld and equate them:

For the first weld:
\[ H_1 = \eta \times V_1 \times I_1 / S_1 \]
\[ H_1 = 0.65 \times 18 \times 200 / 0.002 \]

For the second weld:
\[ H_2 = \eta \times V_2 \times I_2 / S_2 \]
\[ H_2 = 0.65 \times 18 \times I_2 / 0.0022 \]

Since \( H_1 = H_2 \):
\[ 0.65 \times 18 \times 200 / 0.002 = 0.65 \times 18 \times I_2 / 0.0022 \]

We can now solve for \( I_2 \):
\[ 200 / 0.002 = I_2 / 0.0022 \]
\[ I_2 = 200 \times 0.0022 / 0.002 \]
\[ I_2 = 200 \times 1.1 \]
\[ I_2 = 220 \]

So, the welding current for the second weld is 220 A.

(A) increases

The diffusivity or diffusion coefficient in solids typically increases with temperature. This is because higher temperatures provide more thermal energy to the atoms, which increases their vibrational amplitudes and allows them to overcome the energy barriers required to move from one lattice site to another more easily. This results in an increased rate of diffusion.

Therefore, the answer is:

- (A) increases",,,0,
Transport phenomena,1,G-XEC-2015-63-20,NUM,41,The diffusion coefficient of copper atoms in aluminium is found to be 1.28 x $10^(-22)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ at T=400K and 5.75 x $10^(-19)$ $m^2s^(-1)$ at T=500K. Find the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$,"To find the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient of copper atoms in aluminium is $10^{-16}$ $m^2s^{-1}$, we can use the Arrhenius equation for diffusion:

\[ D = D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\right) \]

where:
- \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient,
- \( D_0 \) is the pre-exponential factor (also known as the frequency factor),
- \( E_a \) is the activation energy for diffusion,
- \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \) \( J/K \)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

We have two sets of data for \( D \) and \( T \), which we can use to find \( D_0 \) and \( E_a \):

1. At \( T = 400 \) K, \( D = 1.28 \times 10^{-22} \) \( m^2s^{-1} \)
2. At \( T = 500 \) K, \( D = 5.75 \times 10^{-19} \) \( m^2s^{-1} \)

Let's denote the first set of data as 1 and the second as 2:

\[ D_1 = D_{01} \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{k_B T_1}\right) \]
\[ D_2 = D_{02} \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{k_B T_2}\right) \]

Assuming \( D_0 \) is constant, we can equate the exponents from both equations:

\[ \frac{E_a}{k_B T_1} = \frac{E_a}{k_B T_2} + \ln\left(\frac{D_{02}}{D_{01}}\right) \]

Since \( D_{01} = D_{02} \), the logarithmic term drops out, and we have:

\[ \frac{E_a}{k_B T_1} = \frac{E_a}{k_B T_2} \]

Now we can solve for \( E_a \):

\[ E_a = k_B \left(\frac{\ln(D_2) - \ln(D_1)}{1/T_1 - 1/T_2}\right) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ E_a = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \left(\frac{\ln(5.75 \times 10^{-19}) - \ln(1.28 \times 10^{-22})}{1/400 - 1/500}\right) \]

\[ E_a = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \left(\frac{\ln(4.49 \times 10^{3})}{0.0025 - 0.002}\right) \]

\[ E_a = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \left(\frac{8.407}{0.0005}\right) \]

\[ E_a = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 16814 \]

\[ E_a = 2.32 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} \]

Now that we have \( E_a \), we can find the temperature \( T_3 \) for \( D_3 = 10^{-16} \) \( m^2s^{-1} \):

\[ D_3 = D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{k_B T_3}\right) \]

\[ \ln(D_3) = \ln(D_0) - \frac{E_a}{k_B T_3} \]

\[ \ln(10^{-16}) = \ln(D_0) - \frac{2.32 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot T_3} \]

\[ x^2 = D \cdot t \]

where:
- \( x \) is the diffusion distance (the depth in this case),
- \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient,
- \( t \) is the time.

We are given that at 400 °C, the diffusion coefficient \( D_{400} = 5 \times 10^{-14} m^2s^{-1} \), and the time \( t_{400} = 100 \) hours = \( 100 \times 3600 \) seconds.

At 500 °C, the diffusion coefficient \( D_{500} = 6 \times 10^{-13} m^2s^{-1} \), and we need to find the time \( t_{500} \) to achieve the same concentration at the same depth.

Since the depth \( x \) is the same in both experiments, we can equate \( x^2 \) for both temperatures:

\[ D_{400} \cdot t_{400} = D_{500} \cdot t_{500} \]

Solving for \( t_{500} \):

\[ t_{500} = \frac{D_{400} \cdot t_{400}}{D_{500}} \]

\[ t_{500} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-14} \times 100 \times 3600}{6 \times 10^{-13}} \]

\[ t_{500} = \frac{5 \times 360000}{6} \]

\[ t_{500} = 300000 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, convert the time from seconds to hours:

\[ t_{500} \text{ (in hours)} = \frac{300000}{3600} \]

\[ t_{500} \text{ (in hours)} = 83.\overline{3} \text{ hours} \]

Since we are looking for the time in whole hours and the options are given in whole hours, we can round this number to the nearest whole hour, which would be 83 hours if we are rounding down, or 84 hours if we are rounding to the nearest whole number. However, none of the given options match this result directly.

\[ t_{500} = 300000 \text{ seconds} \]

\[ t_{500} \text{ (in hours)} = \frac{300000}{3600} \]

Transport phenomena,3,G-XEC-2014-22,NUM,32,The diffusion coefficients of Mg in Al at 500 and 550 °C are 1.9 * $10^(-13)$ and 5.8*10^(-13) $m^2/s$ respectively. The activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al in kJ/mol is,"To find the activation energy for the diffusion of Mg in Al, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the diffusion coefficient (D) to the temperature (T) and the activation energy (Q):

\[ D = D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT}\right) \]

where:
- \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient,
- \( D_0 \) is the pre-exponential factor (also known as the frequency factor),
- \( Q \) is the activation energy,
- \( R \) is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

We have two sets of data for the diffusion coefficient at different temperatures:

1. At 500 °C (773 K), \( D = 1.9 \times 10^{-13} \, m^2/s \)
2. At 550 °C (823 K), \( D = 5.8 \times 10^{-13} \, m^2/s \)

We can use these two points to set up two equations and solve for \( Q \). First, we'll take the natural logarithm of both sides of the Arrhenius equation to linearize it:

\[ \ln(D) = \ln(D_0) - \frac{Q}{RT} \]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( \ln(1.9 \times 10^{-13}) = \ln(D_0) - \frac{Q}{R \times 773} \)
2. \( \ln(5.8 \times 10^{-13}) = \ln(D_0) - \frac{Q}{R \times 823} \)

Let's solve these equations step by step:

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate \( \ln(D_0) \):

\[ \ln(5.8 \times 10^{-13}) - \ln(1.9 \times 10^{-13}) = \left(\frac{Q}{R \times 773} - \frac{Q}{R \times 823}\right) \]

\[ \ln\left(\frac{5.8}{1.9}\right) = Q \left(\frac{1}{R \times 773} - \frac{1}{R \times 823}\right) \]

\[ \ln(3) = Q \left(\frac{823 - 773}{R \times 773 \times 823}\right) \]

\[ \ln(3) = Q \left(\frac{50}{R \times 773 \times 823}\right) \]

Now we can solve for \( Q \):

\[ Q = \frac{\ln(3) \times R \times 773 \times 823}{50} \]

Plugging in the value for \( R \):

\[ Q = \frac{\ln(3) \times 8.314 \times 773 \times 823}{50} \]

\[ Q = \frac{\ln(3) \times 8.314 \times 637999}{50} \]

\[ Q \approx \frac{1.0986 \times 8.314 \times 637999}{50} \]

\[ Q \approx 117432 \, J/mol \]

\[ Q \approx 117.432 \, kJ/mol \]

So the activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al is approximately:

\[ \boxed{117.432 \, kJ/mol} \]

Please note that the actual value might differ slightly due to rounding during the calculation. For more precise results, you should use more significant digits for the gas constant and the natural logarithm of 3.

- \( C_0 \) is the surface concentration,
- \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient,
- \( \text{erf} \) is the error function.

\[ \frac{1}{2}C_0 = C_0 \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{10^{-3}}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right) \]

We are given that \( \text{erf}(0.5) \approx 0.5 \), so we can say that:

\[ \text{erf}\left(\frac{10^{-3}}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right) = \text{erf}(0.5) \]

\[ \frac{10^{-3}}{2\sqrt{Dt}} = 0.5 \]

Solving for \( t \), we get:

\[ 2\sqrt{Dt} = 10^{-3} \]

\[ \sqrt{Dt} = \frac{10^{-3}}{2} \]

\[ Dt = \left(\frac{10^{-3}}{2}\right)^2 \]

- \( D = x \times 10^{-13} m^2/s \) (we need to find x).

Plugging the values into the Arrhenius equation:

\[ x \times 10^{-13} = 2 \times 10^{-5} \exp\left(-\frac{142 \times 10^3}{8.314 \times 1000.15}\right) \]

Now, calculate the exponential part:

Nickel corrodes at 298 K in a solution of 0.06 M nickel chloride having pH 4. Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer)","To stop the corrosion of nickel, we need to apply an external potential that is equal to the standard reduction potential of nickel but opposite in sign. The corrosion of nickel can be represented by the following half-reaction:

\[ Ni \rightarrow Ni^{2+} + 2e^- \]

The standard reduction potential for nickel is given as -0.25 V, so we need to apply an external potential of +0.25 V to counteract this.

Now, we need to consider the reaction for hydrogen evolution, which is the reduction of protons (from the acidic solution) to hydrogen gas:

\[ 2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 \]

The standard reduction potential for this reaction is 0 V (by definition, the standard hydrogen electrode has a potential of 0 V). However, we need to correct this for the pH of the solution using the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation for the hydrogen evolution reaction at 298 K is:

\[ E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \frac{1}{[H^+]^2} \]

- \( E \) is the non-standard reduction potential,
- \( E^\circ \) is the standard reduction potential (0 V for hydrogen),

\[ E = - \frac{(8.314)(298)}{(2)(96500)} \times 8 \times 2.303 \]

\[ E = - \frac{(8.314)(298)(8)(2.303)}{(2)(96500)} \]

\[ E \approx -0.05915 \times 8 \]

The external potential required to stop the corrosion of nickel is the sum of the standard reduction potential of nickel and the non-standard reduction potential for hydrogen evolution at pH 4:

- \( t \) is the time in seconds.

We want to find \( t \) such that \( C(x,t) = 0.46 \) wt% at \( x = 5 \) mm.

First, we need to convert the concentrations to a consistent form and solve for \( t \):

\[ 0.46 = 0.01 + (0.001 - 0.01) \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{5 \times 10^{-3}}{2\sqrt{6.0 \times 10^{-11} \cdot t}}\right) \]

\[ -\frac{0.45}{0.009} = \text{erf}\left(\frac{5 \times 10^{-3}}{2\sqrt{6.0 \times 10^{-11} \cdot t}}\right) \]

\[ -50 = \text{erf}\left(\frac{5 \times 10^{-3}}{2\sqrt{6.0 \times 10^{-11} \cdot t}}\right) \]

Now, we need to find the argument \( z \) such that \( \text{erf}(z) = -50 \). Since the error function is not one-to-one, we will need to use an inverse error function (erfinv) to find \( z \):

\[ z = \text{erfinv}(-50) \]

However, we know that the error function ranges from -1 to 1, so there is no real number \( z \) for which \( \text{erf}(z) = -50 \). This suggests there is an error in our calculations. The correct approach is to solve for \( z \) in the equation:

\[ 0.45 = -0.009 \cdot \text{erf}(z) \]

\[ z = \text{erfinv}\left(-\frac{0.45}{0.009}\right) \]

\[ z = \text{erfinv}(-50) \]

Since we cannot have an error function value of -50, we need to correct the equation by dividing by the correct coefficient for the error function term:

\[ 0.45 = -0.009 \cdot \text{erf}(z) \]

\[ z = \text{erfinv}\left(-\frac{0.45}{-0.009}\right) \]

\[ z = \text{erfinv}(50) \]

Now we can find \( z \) using a calculator or software that has the inverse error function capability. Once we have \( z \), we can solve for \( t \",,,0,

Assume that corrosion is uniform and, anodic and cathodic reactions are under activation control. The rate of metal dissolution in A $m^(−2)$ is? (round off to 1 decimal place)  ","To solve this problem, we can use the Tafel equation, which relates the overpotential (polarization) to the current density for an electrode reaction under activation control. The Tafel equation is given by:

\[ \eta = a + b \log_{10}(i) \]

where:
- \( \eta \) is the overpotential (in volts),
- \( a \) is the Tafel constant (intercept),
- \( b \) is the Tafel slope (in volts per decade), and
- \( i \) is the current density (in A \( m^{-2} \)).

Given:
- The overpotential (\( \eta \)) is 0.4 V (anodic polarization),
- The exchange current density (\( i_0 \)) is \( 10^{-5} \) A \( m^{-2} \),
- The Tafel slope (\( b \)) is 0.1 V/decade for the anodic reaction.

We can rearrange the Tafel equation to solve for the current density (\( i \)):

\[ i = i_0 \cdot 10^{\frac{\eta}{b}} \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ i = 10^{-5} \cdot 10^{\frac{0.4}{0.1}} \]
\[ i = 10^{-5} \cdot 10^{4} \]
\[ i = 10^{-1} \]

(Round off to 1 decimal). ","To solve this problem, we can use the diffusion equation for one dimension, which is given by:

\[ x = \sqrt{Dt} \]

where:
- \( x \) is the diffusion depth,
- \( D \) is the diffusivity,
- \( t \) is the time.

Given that component A diffuses into a solid to a depth of 10 μm (10 × 10^(-6) m) in 1 hour (3600 seconds) at 300 K, we can express this as:

\[ 10 \times 10^{-6} = \sqrt{(D_A)_{300K} \times 3600} \]

We can solve for \((D_A)_{300K}\):

\[ (D_A)_{300K} = \left( \frac{10 \times 10^{-6}}{\sqrt{3600}} \right)^2 \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t' \) for the same depth of diffusion at 600 K. We know the diffusivity at 600 K, \( (D_A)_{600K} \), can be calculated using the given Arrhenius-type equation:

\[ D_A = (D_A)^\circ \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\right) \]

Let's calculate \( (D_A)_{600K} \):

\[ (D_A)_{600K} = (D_A)^\circ \exp\left(-\frac{0.3}{8.62 \times 10^{-5} \times 600}\right) \]

We don't have \( (D_A)^\circ \), but we can express \( (D_A)_{600K} \) in terms of \( (D_A)_{300K} \) since they both involve \( (D_A)^\circ \):

\[ \frac{(D_A)_{600K}}{(D_A)_{300K}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{0.3}{8.62 \times 10^{-5} \times 600}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{0.3}{8.62 \times 10^{-5} \times 300}\right)} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ (D_A)_{600K} = (D_A)_{300K} \exp\left(-\frac{0.3}{8.62 \times 10^{-5}} \left(\frac{1}{600} - \frac{1}{300}\right)\right) \]

Now we can calculate \( (D_A)_{600K} \) using the value of \( (D_A)_{300K} \) we found earlier and then find \( t' \):

\[ (D_A)_{600K} = \left( \frac{10 \times 10^{-6}}{\sqrt{3600}} \right)^2 \exp\left(-\frac{0.3}{8.62 \times 10^{-5}} \left(\frac{1}{600} - \frac{1}{300}\right)\right) \]

- Electrode polarization (P) refers to a shift in the electrode potential from its equilibrium value due to the formation of a concentration gradient. This is related to the concept of overvoltage (3), which is the extra voltage required to drive a reaction at a significant rate.

- Passivity (Q) is the phenomenon where a material, often a metal, becomes less reactive due to the formation of a stable surface layer, typically an oxide film. This corresponds to the surface oxide film (4).

- Selective leaching (R) is a type of corrosion where one element is preferentially removed from an alloy. A common example is dezincification (1), where zinc is selectively leached from brass alloys.

- Grain boundary precipitation (S) is a process where precipitates form at the grain boundaries of a material, which can make the material more susceptible to intergranular corrosion.

- **Grain boundary diffusion ($D_(GB)$):** Grain boundaries are the interfaces between crystallites in a polycrystalline material. Diffusion along grain boundaries is faster than lattice diffusion because the atomic structure is less ordered, and there are more defects, which facilitate atomic movement.

\[ x^2 = Dt \]

For a given concentration profile, the diffusion distance (x) is constant. Therefore, the product of the diffusion coefficient (D) and time (t) must also be constant for the same concentration profile to be achieved at different temperatures.

Let's denote the time required at 500°C as \( t_{500} \) and the time required at 600°C as \( t_{600} \). We are given \( D_{500} \) and \( D_{600} \), as well as \( t_{600} \). We want to find \( t_{500} \).

Now, we can set up the equation relating the diffusion distances and times at the two temperatures:
\[ D_{500} \cdot t_{500} = D_{600} \cdot t_{600} \]

Solving for \( t_{500} \):

Substituting the given values:
\[ t_{500} = \frac{8 \times 10^{-13} \cdot 36000}{4 \times 10^{-14}} \]

\[ t_{500} = \frac{8 \cdot 36000}{4} \]

Generally, smaller atoms diffuse faster than larger ones because they can more easily move through the interstitial spaces in the crystal lattice.

Given the elements to choose from (Ni, Co, Cr, C), we can consider the following:

- Nickel (Ni) and Cobalt (Co) are both transition metals with similar atomic sizes and have a substitutional mechanism of diffusion in iron, where they replace iron atoms in the lattice.
- Chromium (Cr) is also a transition metal but has a larger atomic radius compared to Ni and Co, which could potentially slow down its diffusion rate.

\[ \log_{10}K_{[N]} = -\frac{518}{1873} - 1.063 \]

\[ \log_{10}K_{[N]} = -\frac{518}{1873} - 1.063 \]

\[ \log_{10}K_{[N]} \approx -0.2767 - 1.063 \]

\[ \log_{10}K_{[N]} \approx -1.3397 \]

Now, we convert from logarithmic form to the actual value of \( K_{[N]} \):

\[ K_{[N]} = 10^{-1.3397} \]

\[ K_{[N]} \approx 0.0456 \ atm^{1/2} \]

Since the activity of nitrogen \( [h_N] \) is defined with respect to 1 wt.% Henrian standard state, the relationship between activity and concentration (in wt.%) is linear for dilute solutions. Therefore, we can write:

\[ [h_N] = K_{[N]} \cdot (P_{N_2})^{1/2} \]

If 200g of weight is lost over a period of 10 years, then the corrosion rate($kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$) is?(round off to the nearest integer)","To calculate the corrosion rate in $kg.m^2.year^{-1}$, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the weight loss from grams to kilograms.
2. Convert the surface area from square centimeters to square meters.
3. Calculate the time in years.
4. Combine these values to find the corrosion rate.

Given:
- Weight loss = 200 g = 0.2 kg (since 1 kg = 1000 g)
- Surface area = 50 cm² = 0.005 m² (since 1 m² = 10,000 cm²)
- Time = 10 years

Now, we calculate the corrosion rate:

Corrosion rate = Weight loss (kg) / (Surface area (m²) × Time (years))

Plugging in the values:

Corrosion rate = 0.2 kg / (0.005 m² × 10 years)
Corrosion rate = 0.2 kg / 0.05 m²·years
Corrosion rate = 4 kg/(m²·year)

Rounded to the nearest integer, the corrosion rate is 4 kg/(m²·year).

Assuming $𝑎_1$ = $𝑎_2$ = 1, the magnitude of flux at 𝑥 = 2 mm is y * $10^(-3)atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1)$. Find value of y.(answer rounded off to the nearest integer).","To find the magnitude of flux at \( x = 2 \) mm, we need to calculate the concentration gradient at that point and then use Fick's first law of diffusion, which relates the flux \( J \) to the diffusion coefficient \( D \) and the concentration gradient \( \frac{dC}{dx} \).

Fick's first law is given by:
\[ J = -D \cdot \frac{dC}{dx} \]

Given that \( D = 3 \times 10^{-3} mm^2 \cdot s^{-1} \), and \( C = x^2 + x \) with \( a_1 = a_2 = 1 \), we need to find the derivative \( \frac{dC}{dx} \):

\[ \frac{dC}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + x) = 2x + 1 \]

Now, let's evaluate the concentration gradient at \( x = 2 \) mm:

\[ \left(\frac{dC}{dx}\right)_{x=2} = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

The units of the concentration gradient are \( atoms.mm^{-4} \) since \( C \) is in \( atoms.mm^{-3} \) and \( x \) is in \( mm \).

Now we can calculate the flux at \( x = 2 \) mm:

\[ |J| = D \cdot \left|\frac{dC}{dx}\right|_{x=2} = 3 \times 10^{-3} mm^2 \cdot s^{-1} \cdot 5 \, atoms.mm^{-4} \]

\[ |J| = 15 \times 10^{-3} atoms.mm^{-2}s^{-1} \]

So the magnitude of flux at \( x = 2 \) mm is \( 15 \times 10^{-3} atoms.mm^{-2}s^{-1} \), which means \( y = 15 \). The answer, rounded to the nearest integer, is already an integer, so the value of \( y \) is:

The electric current(in amperes) required to generate the necessary magnetic field is?  (round off to 1 decimal place),"To demagnetize a magnet, we need to apply an external magnetic field that is equal to its coercivity but in the opposite direction. The coercivity of the iron bar magnet is given as 7000 A \(m^{-1}\).

The magnetic field \(H\) inside a solenoid is given by the formula:

\[ H = \frac{N \cdot I}{L} \]

where:
- \(H\) is the magnetic field strength (in A \(m^{-1}\)),
- \(N\) is the number of turns in the solenoid,
- \(I\) is the current through the solenoid (in amperes),
- \(L\) is the length of the solenoid (in meters).

We want to find the current \(I\) required to produce a magnetic field \(H\) equal to the coercivity of the magnet. Rearranging the formula to solve for \(I\), we get:

\[ I = \frac{H \cdot L}{N} \]

Given:
- \(H\) = 7000 A \(m^{-1}\) (coercivity of the magnet),
- \(L\) = 0.25 m (length of the solenoid),

For bcc iron, the atomic density (N) can be calculated using the lattice parameter (a) with the formula:

\[ N = \frac{2}{a^3} \]

Given the lattice parameter \( a = 2.866 \times 10^{-10} \) meters (or Ångströms), we can calculate N:

\[ N = \frac{2}{(2.866 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^3} \]

The magnetic moment per atom for iron is approximately \( 2.22 \mu_B \) (Bohr magnetons). To convert this to Amperes per meter, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \) Ampsquared meters (A/m):

The magneteic moments of cations on octahedral sites are antiparallel with respect to those on tetrahedral sites. Atomic number of Fe is 26 and that of O is 8. The saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_(3)O_(4)$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons ($µ_B$) will be ? Ignore contribution from orbital magnetic moments. ,"To solve for the saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_3O_4$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons ($µ_B$), we need to consider the electronic configuration of iron (Fe) and the distribution of its cations in the spinel structure.

Iron (Fe) has an atomic number of 26, which means it has 26 electrons. Its electronic configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 3d^6 4s^2$. In the context of magnetism in $Fe_3O_4$, we are interested in the $3d$ electrons, as they contribute to the magnetic moment.

In $Fe_3O_4$, which is an inverse spinel, the distribution of cations is as follows:
- Half of the B cations occupy tetrahedral sites.
- The remaining B cations and all A cations occupy octahedral sites.

For $Fe_3O_4$, Fe exists in two oxidation states: $Fe^{3+}$ (ferric ion) and $Fe^{2+}$ (ferrous ion). The $Fe^{3+}$ ion has a configuration of $3d^5$, and the $Fe^{2+}$ ion has a configuration of $3d^6$.

In the inverse spinel structure of $Fe_3O_4$:
- Tetrahedral sites are occupied by $Fe^{3+}$ ions.
- Octahedral sites are occupied by both $Fe^{3+}$ and $Fe^{2+}$ ions.

The magnetic moments of the ions are as follows:
- $Fe^{3+}$ ($3d^5$) has 5 unpaired electrons, each contributing 1 $µ_B$, so its magnetic moment is 5 $µ_B$.
- $Fe^{2+}$ ($3d^6$) has 4 unpaired electrons, each contributing 1 $µ_B$, so its magnetic moment is 4 $µ_B$.

Since the magnetic moments of cations on octahedral sites are antiparallel to those on tetrahedral sites, we need to subtract the magnetic moment of the $Fe^{3+}$ ions on the tetrahedral sites from the combined magnetic moments of the $Fe^{3+}$ and $Fe^{2+}$ ions on the octahedral sites.

The formula unit of $Fe_3O_4$ contains:
- 1 $Fe^{3+}$ on a tetrahedral site.
- 2 $Fe^{3+}$ on octahedral sites.
- 1 $Fe^{2+}$ on an octahedral site.

Calculating the total magnetic moment:
- The $Fe^{3+}$ on the tetrahedral site contributes -5 $µ_B$ (since it's antiparallel to the octahedral sites).
- The 2 $Fe^{3+}$ on the octahedral sites contribute 2 * 5 $µ_B$ = 10 $µ_B$.
- The $Fe^{2+}$ on the octahedral site contributes 4 $µ_B$.

Adding these up gives us the total magnetic moment per formula unit:
Total magnetic moment = (2 * 5) + 4 - 5 = 10 + 4 - 5 = 9 $µ_B$.

Therefore, the saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_3O_4$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons ($µ_B$) is:

\[ M = \frac{\text{Magnetic moment}}{\text{Volume}} \]

The magnetic moment (μ) is given as \(4.2 \times 10^{-7} \, Am^2\).

To find the volume of the magnet, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} \]

The mass (m) of the magnet is 50 g, which is \(50 \times 10^{-3} \, kg\), and the density (d) is given as \(7.2 \, g \, cm^{-3}\), which is \(7.2 \times 10^{3} \, kg \, m^{-3}\) (since \(1 \, g \, cm^{-3} = 10^{3} \, kg \, m^{-3}\)).

Now, let's calculate the volume (V):

\[ V = \frac{m}{d} = \frac{50 \times 10^{-3} \, kg}{7.2 \times 10^{3} \, kg \, m^{-3}} \]

\[ V = \frac{50}{7.2} \times 10^{-6} \, m^3 \]

\[ V = 6.9444 \ldots \times 10^{-6} \, m^3 \]

The saturation magnetization is the maximum magnetization of a material and is reached when all magnetic moments in the material are aligned with the external magnetic field.

The relationship between saturation magnetization (M_s), the magnetic moment per atom (μ), and the atomic density (N) in the material is given by:

\[ M_s = N \cdot \mu \]

where N is the number of atoms per unit volume, and μ is the magnetic moment per atom in units of Am² (which can be converted to Bohr magnetons, where 1 Bohr magneton ≈ 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ Am²).

For an FCC (face-centered cubic) lattice, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. The atomic density (N) can be calculated from the lattice parameter (a) as follows:

\[ N = \frac{4}{a^3} \]

Given that the lattice parameter (a) is 0.2 nm (or 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m), we can calculate N:

\[ N = \frac{4}{(2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^3} \]
\[ N = \frac{4}{(8 \times 10^{-30} \text{ m}^3)} \]
\[ N = 5 \times 10^{29} \text{ atoms/m}^3 \]

Now, using the given saturation magnetization (M_s) of 600 kA/m (or 600 × 10³ A/m), we can solve for the magnetic moment per atom (μ):

\[ \mu = \frac{M_s}{N} \]
\[ \mu = \frac{600 \times 10^3 \text{ A/m}}{5 \times 10^{29} \text{ atoms/m}^3} \]
\[ \mu = 1.2 \times 10^{-26} \text{ Am}^2 \]

To convert this to Bohr magnetons (μ_B), we divide by the value of one Bohr magneton in Am²:

\[ \mu_{\text{B}} = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-26} \text{ Am}^2}{9.274 \times 10^{-24} \text{ Am}^2/\mu_{\text{B}}} \]
\[ \mu_{\text{B}} = 1.3 \times 10^{-3} \mu_{\text{B}} \approx 0.517 \mu_{\text{B}} \]

Therefore, the net magnetic moment per atom is approximately 0.517 Bohr magnetons.

The correct answer is (C) 0.517.

1. Calculate the volume of the unit cell for BCC iron:
The volume of a BCC unit cell is given by $a^3$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter. For iron, $a = 0.287 \times 10^{-9}$ m (since 1 nm = $10^{-9}$ m).

\[ V = a^3 = (0.287 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3 \]

2. Calculate the number of Fe atoms per unit cell for BCC structure:
BCC structure has 2 atoms per unit cell.

3. Calculate the number of Fe atoms per unit volume:
\[ \text{Atoms per unit volume} = \frac{\text{Atoms per unit cell}}{V} \]

4. Calculate the saturation magnetization:
The saturation magnetization $M_s$ is the product of the magnetic moment per atom $\mu$ and the number of atoms per unit volume $N$.

\[ M_s = \mu \times N \]

Given that the net magnetic moment of an Fe atom is $2 \mu_B$, where $\mu_B = 9.273 \times 10^{-24}$ A m², we can calculate $M_s$ as follows:

\[ \mu = 2 \times 9.273 \times 10^{-24} \text{ A m}^2 \]
\[ N = \frac{2}{V} \]
\[ M_s = \mu \times N \]

Now let's plug in the numbers:

\[ V = (0.287 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^3 = 2.351 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m}^3 \]
\[ N = \frac{2}{2.351 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m}^3} \]
\[ N \approx 8.506 \times 10^{28} \text{ m}^{-3} \]
\[ \mu = 2 \times 9.273 \times 10^{-24} \text{ A m}^2 = 1.8546 \times 10^{-23} \text{ A m}^2 \]
\[ M_s = (1.8546 \times 10^{-23} \text{ A m}^2) \times (8.506 \times 10^{28} \text{ m}^{-3}) \]
\[ M_s \approx 1.578 \times 10^{7} \text{ A m}^{-1} \]

Since we want the result in kiloAmperes (kA), we convert it as follows:
\[ M_s \approx 1.578 \times 10^{7} \text{ A m}^{-1} \times \frac{1 \text{ kA}}{10^3 \text{ A}} \]
\[ M_s \approx 1.578 \times 10^{4} \text{ kA m}^{-1} \]

Let's go through each element and its behavior:

- Copper (P): Copper is a metal that exhibits superconductivity at very low temperatures. It is not ferromagnetic, semiconducting, or diamagnetic under normal conditions.
- Iron (Q): Iron is a well-known ferromagnetic material at room temperature. It is not superconducting, semiconducting, or diamagnetic under normal conditions.
- Mercury (R): Mercury is a metal that is diamagnetic. It is not ferromagnetic, semiconducting, or superconducting under normal conditions. However, mercury can become superconducting at extremely low temperatures.
- Silicon (S): Silicon is a semiconductor. It is not ferromagnetic, superconducting, or diamagnetic.

Now, let's match the elements with their behaviors:

- Copper (P) is superconducting at very low temperatures, so it matches with 2. Superconducting.
- Iron (Q) is ferromagnetic, so it matches with 1. Ferromagnetic.
- Mercury (R) is diamagnetic, so it matches with 4. Diamagnetic.
- Silicon (S) is semiconducting, so it matches with 3. Semiconducting.

Given the above matches, the correct answer is:

- P-2 (Copper - Superconducting)
- Q-1 (Iron - Ferromagnetic)

However, there seems to be a mistake in the options provided, as none of them correctly pair the elements with their electronic behaviors based on the standard properties. The closest match to our findings is option (C), but it incorrectly pairs Mercury (R) with superconducting (2) instead of diamagnetic (4).

Given the incorrect options, we should choose the one that is closest to the correct answer, which is option (C), but with the understanding that it contains an error in the pairing of Mercury (R). The correct pairs should be as follows:

1. **Diamagnetism**: This occurs in materials where all the electrons are paired and there is no permanent magnetic moment. An external magnetic field induces a magnetic moment in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive effect. Diamagnetic materials do not have a spontaneous alignment of atomic dipole moments.

2. **Paramagnetism**: This is found in materials where atoms or ions have unpaired electrons, leading to a permanent magnetic moment. However, in the absence of an external magnetic field, the dipole moments are randomly oriented due to thermal agitation, resulting in no net magnetization.

3. **Ferromagnetism**: In ferromagnetic materials, the atomic dipole moments align spontaneously in the same direction below a certain temperature (the Curie temperature), leading to a strong net magnetization even in the absence of an external magnetic field.

4. **Antiferromagnetism**: This is similar to ferromagnetism in that it involves spontaneous alignment of atomic dipole moments. However, in antiferromagnetic materials, adjacent dipole moments align in opposite directions, leading to a net magnetization of zero.

Given the schematic representations P, Q, R, and S for atomic dipole moments:

- P shows no alignment, which is indicative of diamagnetism.
- Q shows an alternating alignment of dipole moments, which is characteristic of antiferromagnetism.
- R shows randomly aligned dipole moments, which suggests paramagnetism.
- S shows aligned dipole moments, which is typical of ferromagnetism.

Magnetism,14,G-META-21-20,NUM,42,"Given: (Lattice paramter of iron at room temperature = 0.287 nm). If saturation magnetization of iron at room temperature is 1700 $kAm^(-1)$, then magnetic moment (in $Am^(2)$) per iron atom in the crystal is x * $10^(-23)$(round off to 1 decimal place).","To find the magnetic moment per iron atom, we need to use the formula that relates saturation magnetization (M_s) to the magnetic moment per atom (μ) and the density of atoms (n) in the material:

\[ M_s = n \cdot \mu \]

The density of atoms (n) can be calculated from the lattice parameter (a) and the number of iron atoms per unit cell (Z). Iron has a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure at room temperature, and for a bcc lattice, Z = 2.

The volume (V) of the unit cell is given by:

\[ V = a^3 \]

For iron, the lattice parameter (a) is given as 0.287 nm, which we need to convert to meters for consistency in units:

\[ a = 0.287 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume of the unit cell:

\[ V = (0.287 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m})^3 \]
\[ V = (0.287)^3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{m}^3 \]
\[ V = 0.0229 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{m}^3 \]
\[ V = 2.29 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{m}^3 \]

The density of atoms (n) is then:

\[ n = \frac{Z}{V} \]
\[ n = \frac{2}{2.29 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{m}^3} \]
\[ n = 0.873 \times 10^{29} \, \text{atoms/m}^3 \]

Now we can find the magnetic moment per atom (μ) using the saturation magnetization (M_s) given as 1700 kA/m:

\[ M_s = n \cdot \mu \]
\[ \mu = \frac{M_s}{n} \]
\[ \mu = \frac{1700 \times 10^3 \, \text{A/m}}{0.873 \times 10^{29} \, \text{atoms/m}^3} \]
\[ \mu = 1.947 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2 \]

So the magnetic moment per iron atom is approximately \( 1.9 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2 \) (rounded off to 1 decimal place).

The final answer for x is:

\[ x = 1.9 \]

Therefore, the magnetic moment per iron atom in the crystal is \( 1.9 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2 \).

- **Peak Position**: Shifts in the position of the peak can indicate changes in the lattice parameters due to strain.
- **Peak Broadening**: Broadening of the peak can be indicative of microstrain within the material. This is because strain causes a distribution of lattice spacings, which leads to a spread in the angles at which constructive interference occurs.

When these electrons interact with the sample, they can cause secondary electrons to be emitted from the surface. These secondary electrons are then detected, and an image is formed based on the number of secondary electrons detected at each point.

2. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM): TEM operates by transmitting electrons through a very thin sample. The electrons interact with the sample, and their diffraction patterns are used to create an image. The image formed is a projection of the sample's structure.

3. Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM): STM operates based on the quantum mechanical phenomenon of tunnelling. When a conducting tip is brought very close to a conducting surface, a bias voltage allows electrons to tunnel through the vacuum between the tip and the surface. The tunnelling current is dependent on the distance between the tip and the surface and is used to map the surface topography at the atomic level.

4. Atomic Force Microscope (AFM): AFM uses a cantilever with a sharp tip that is brought into close proximity with the sample surface. The forces between the tip and the sample surface, such as van der Waals forces, cause the cantilever to deflect. These deflections are measured to produce an image of the surface topography.

(A) Atomic number of the specimen material - **Yes**, the atomic number of the specimen material plays a significant role in backscattered electron (BSE) imaging.

Lower accelerating voltages are typically used to improve resolution and surface sensitivity, while higher voltages increase penetration and may reduce material contrast due to larger excitation volumes.

This transition does not involve a change in crystalline structure, but rather a change in the mobility of the polymer chains.

To determine the glass transition temperature of a polymer, the following methods can be used:

- (A) Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to determine the thermal stability of a material and the temperature at which it decomposes. TGA measures the weight change of a sample as a function of temperature. While TGA can provide information about the thermal degradation of polymers, it is not typically used to measure Tg.

- (B) Raman spectroscopy is a technique used to observe vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in a system. It can provide information about the structure and composition of materials, but it is not a standard method for determining Tg.

- (C) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the molecular structure of compounds and can provide information about the dynamics of molecules. While NMR can be used to study the motion of polymer chains and thus infer Tg, it is not the most common method for its direct measurement.

- (D) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is the most common technique used to measure the glass transition temperature of polymers.

- Backscattered electrons (Q) are high-energy primary electrons that are elastically scattered back out of the specimen. They provide information about the composition and topography of the sample, with heavier elements backscattering more electrons and appearing brighter in the image. This makes them useful for distinguishing different phases based on average atomic number.

A spike, either upward or downward, corresponds to a sudden release or absorption of heat, respectively. Here are the scenarios for each option:

(A) Heating 10 mg of pure Cu from 323 K to 673 K:
Copper is a metal with a high melting point (around 1358 K), so within the given temperature range, there are no phase transitions such as melting or boiling. Therefore, we would not expect a spike in the DSC thermogram; instead, there would be a gradual increase in heat capacity with temperature.

(B) Cooling pure water from 323 K to 278 K:
Cooling water from 323 K to 278 K does not involve any phase transitions. Water remains in the liquid phase throughout this temperature range. Therefore, there would be no spike in the DSC thermogram.

(C) Heating pure ice from 263 K to 284 K:
In this case, we are heating ice from below its melting point (273 K) to above it. As the ice reaches 273 K, it will start to melt, which is an endothermic process. This means that the DSC thermogram will exhibit an upward spike (endothermic peak) as heat is absorbed by the ice to break the hydrogen bonds and melt into water.

(D) Cooling a Pb-Sn alloy at the eutectic composition from 323 K to 273 K:
The eutectic composition of a Pb-Sn alloy solidifies at a lower temperature than either pure lead or pure tin. If the alloy is cooled from above its melting point to below it, the liquid alloy will solidify. This phase transition from liquid to solid is an exothermic process, so the DSC thermogram will exhibit a downward spike (exothermic peak) as heat is released during solidification.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is:

- (C) Heating pure ice from 263 K to 284 K, because the melting of ice is an endothermic process that will cause an upward spike in the DSC thermogram.
- (D) Cooling a Pb-Sn alloy at the eutectic composition from 323 K to 273 K, because the solidification of the alloy is an exothermic process that will cause a downward spike in the DSC thermogram.

- (C) X-rays

Explanation: In a scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-rays are used for quantitative elemental analysis. This technique is known as Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS or EDX). When the electron beam hits the specimen, it can cause inner shell electrons to be ejected from atoms within the specimen. Outer shell electrons then move to fill the vacancy, emitting X-rays with characteristic energies specific to the element from which they were emitted. By analyzing the energy and intensity of these X-rays, the elemental composition of the specimen can be determined quantitatively.

Fluid,0,G-META-12-7,MCQS-NUM,47,A fluid is flowing with a velocity of 0.5 m/s on a plate moving with a velocity of 0.01 m/s in the same direction. The velocity at the interface of the fluid and plate is  (A) 0.0 m/s (B) 0.01 m/s (C) 0.255 m/s (D) 0.50 m/s,"To solve this question, we need to consider the relative velocity between the fluid and the plate. Since the plate is moving with a velocity of 0.01 m/s in the same direction as the fluid, which is flowing at 0.5 m/s, we can simply add these two velocities to find the velocity at the interface of the fluid and the plate.

Velocity of fluid relative to stationary observer = 0.5 m/s
Velocity of plate relative to stationary observer = 0.01 m/s

Velocity at the interface relative to stationary observer = Velocity of fluid + Velocity of plate
Velocity at the interface relative to stationary observer = 0.5 m/s + 0.01 m/s
Velocity at the interface relative to stationary observer = 0.51 m/s

However, this value is not one of the options provided. The closest answer to our calculated value is (C) 0.255 m/s, but this seems to be incorrect as it does not match our calculation. The correct answer should be slightly higher than 0.5 m/s due to the additional velocity of the plate.

Fluid,1,G-META-12-49,MCQS-NUM,115,"A steel ball (density $ρ_(steel)$ = 7200 kg/$m^(3)$) is placed in an upward moving liquid Al (density $ρ_(Al)$ = 2360 kg/$m^(3)$, viscosity $μ_(Al)$ = 1*$10^(–3)$ Pa.s and Reynolds number = 5*$10^(5)$). The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball. The terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle having diameter $d_p$, in µm range, if allowed to fall in a quiescent liquid Al bath, is  (A) 5.2*$10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (B) 2.6* $10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (C) 1.3*$10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (D) 6.6* $10^5$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s ","To find the terminal velocity of the steel particle falling in the liquid aluminum bath, we need to balance the forces acting on the particle. The terminal velocity is reached when the gravitational force (weight of the particle in the liquid) is balanced by the drag force (due to the liquid's resistance to the particle's motion).

The gravitational force (F_g) acting on the steel particle is given by the difference in density between the steel and the aluminum, multiplied by the volume of the particle and the acceleration due to gravity (g):

\[ F_g = V \cdot g \cdot (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{Al}) \]
\[ F_g = \frac{π}{6} d_p^3 \cdot g \cdot (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{Al}) \]

The drag force (F_d) can be expressed using the given formula for the force exerted on the steel ball:

\[ F_d = f \cdot π \cdot R^2 \cdot \frac{ρ_{Al} \cdot v^2}{2} \]

Since we are looking for the terminal velocity (v_t), we set the gravitational force equal to the drag force:

\[ \frac{π}{6} d_p^3 \cdot g \cdot (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{Al}) = f \cdot π \cdot \left(\frac{d_p}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{ρ_{Al} \cdot v_t^2}{2} \]

Solving for v_t, we get:

\[ v_t^2 = \frac{\frac{π}{6} d_p^3 \cdot g \cdot (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{Al})}{f \cdot π \cdot \left(\frac{d_p}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{ρ_{Al}}{2}} \]

\[ v_t^2 = \frac{\frac{1}{6} d_p^3 \cdot g \cdot (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{Al})}{\frac{f}{4} \cdot d_p^2 \cdot \frac{ρ_{Al}}{2}} \]

\[ v_t^2 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{g \cdot (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{Al})}{f \cdot ρ_{Al}} \cdot d_p \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{g \cdot (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{Al})}{f \cdot ρ_{Al}} \cdot d_p} \]

Now we can plug in the values:

\[ ρ_{steel} = 7200 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \]
\[ ρ_{Al} = 2360 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \]
\[ f = 0.2 \]
\[ g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{9.81 \cdot (7200 - 2360)}{0.2 \cdot 2360} \cdot d_p} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{9.81 \cdot 4840}{472} \cdot d_p} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3} \cdot 10.25 \cdot d_p} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{6.833 \cdot d_p} \]

Since the diameter is in micrometers (µm), we need to convert it to meters to match the units of the terminal velocity:

\[ d_p \, (\text{m}) = d_p \, (\text{µm}) \times 10^{-6} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{6.833 \cdot d_p \times 10^{-6}} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{6.833} \cdot \sqrt{d_p} \cdot 10^{-3} \]

At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is","To calculate the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle, we can use the following formula derived from Bernoulli's principle for a liquid flowing out of an orifice:

\[ \text{Mass Flow Rate} = \rho \cdot Q \cdot C_d \]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the density of the liquid (kg/m³),
- \( Q \) is the volume flow rate (m³/s),
- \( C_d \) is the discharge coefficient (dimensionless).

The volume flow rate \( Q \) can be calculated using Torricelli's law, which states that the velocity of a fluid flowing out of an orifice under the force of gravity is equal to the velocity it would have if it were falling freely from the height of the fluid above the orifice:

\[ v = \sqrt{2gh} \]

where:
- \( v \) is the velocity of the fluid (m/s),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²),
- \( h \) is the height of the fluid above the center of the orifice (m).

The volume flow rate \( Q \) is then:

\[ Q = A \cdot v \]

where:
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle (m²).

Given:
- \( \rho = 7000 \) kg/m³,
- Nozzle diameter \( d = 30 \) mm = 0.03 m (radius \( r = d/2 = 0.015 \) m),
- \( C_d = 0.80 \),
- \( h = 3.2 \) m.

First, calculate the area \( A \) of the nozzle:

\[ A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.015)^2 \]

Then, calculate the velocity \( v \):

\[ v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 3.2} \]

Now, calculate the volume flow rate \( Q \):

\[ Q = A \cdot v = \pi (0.015)^2 \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 3.2} \]

Finally, calculate the mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \):

\[ \dot{m} = \rho \cdot Q \cdot C_d = 7000 \cdot \pi (0.015)^2 \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 3.2} \cdot 0.80 \]

Let's do the math:

\[ A = \pi (0.015)^2 = \pi \cdot 0.000225 \]
\[ v = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 3.2} = \sqrt{62.7744} \approx 7.92 \text{ m/s} \]
\[ Q = \pi \cdot 0.000225 \cdot 7.92 \approx 0.0055 \text{ m³/s} \]
\[ \dot{m} = 7000 \cdot 0.0055 \cdot 0.80 \approx 30.8 \text{ kg/s} \]

So the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle is approximately:

1. **Drag coefficient (P)**: This is a dimensionless quantity that describes the drag of an object in a fluid environment. It is defined in such a way that it accounts for the shape, size, and flow conditions, but not the density, velocity, or viscosity of the fluid. Therefore, its dimensions are $M^(0)L^(0)T^(0)$.

2. **Mass transfer coefficient (Q)**: This coefficient is used in the context of mass transfer operations and has dimensions that involve mass transfer rate, area, and concentration difference. Its dimensions are typically $LT^(-1)$ because it represents a velocity at which mass is transferred.

3. **Viscosity (R)**: Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. It is defined as the shear stress over the velocity gradient and has dimensions of $ML^(-1)T^(-1)$.

4. **Mass flux (S)**: Mass flux is the rate of mass flow per unit area. Its dimensions are $ML^(-2)T^(-1)$, as it involves mass flow rate (which has dimensions of $MT^(-1)$) divided by area (which has dimensions of $L^2$).

Now, let's match the entities with their dimensions:

- Drag coefficient (P) matches with $M^(0)L^(0)T^(0)$ which is option [3].
- Mass transfer coefficient (Q) matches with $LT^(-1)$, which when expressed in terms of mass (M), length (L), and time (T) is equivalent to $ML^(-2)T^(-1)$ (since mass transfer rate is typically mass per time, and area is length squared). This corresponds to option [2].
- Viscosity (R) matches with $ML^(-1)T^(-1)$, which is option [1].
- Mass flux (S) matches with $ML^(-2)T^(-1)$, which is option [2].

However, there is a slight issue here because both the Mass transfer coefficient (Q) and Mass flux (S) have been matched to the same dimensions ($ML^(-2)T^(-1)$). We need to re-evaluate this.

Upon re-evaluation, we realize that the Mass transfer coefficient (Q) should have dimensions of $LT^(-1)$ without the mass term, as it is a transfer coefficient and not a flux. Therefore, its dimensions are actually $L^(1)T^(-1)$, which does not directly correspond to any of the given options. However, since we are looking for the closest match and considering that mass transfer coefficient often involves mass transfer per unit area per unit concentration difference, the correct dimensions would be $L^(2)T^(-1)$ when considering the area term, which is not listed in the options. This seems to be an error in the question, as none of the options perfectly match the expected dimensions for Q.

Given the options provided and the common practice of expressing mass transfer coefficient in terms of mass, length, and time, we will match it with $ML^(-2)T^(-1)$ as the closest approximation.

Therefore, the correct matches are:

The velocity boundary layer thickness, $𝛿_𝑣$, is primarily dependent on the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, with a lower kinematic viscosity leading to a thinner boundary layer for a given flow condition.

Given that the kinematic viscosity of liquid metals is significantly lower than their thermal diffusivity, we can infer the following:

- The velocity boundary layer will be thinner due to the lower kinematic viscosity.
- The thermal boundary layer will be thicker due to the higher thermal diffusivity.

- \( Q \) is the volumetric flow rate (m³/s),
- \( k \) is the permeability of the bed (m²),
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the bed (m²),
- \( dh/dx \) is the hydraulic gradient (dimensionless),
- \( \mu \) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s).

Given:
- \( g = 9.8 \) m/s² (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( \rho \) (density of water) = 1000 kg/m³,
- Pressure drop (\( \Delta P \)) = 300 mm of water per meter of bed height,
- Permeability (\( k \)) = 0.8 m⁴/(N·s),
- We need to find \( q \), the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area (\( Q/A \)) in (m³/s)/m², which simplifies to m/s.

First, we need to convert the pressure drop from mm of water to Pascals (Pa):

\[ \Delta P = \rho \cdot g \cdot h \]
\[ \Delta P = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 \cdot 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 \cdot 0.3 \text{ m} \]
\[ \Delta P = 2940 \text{ Pa} \]

Now, we can rearrange Darcy's law to solve for \( q \):

\[ q = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{k \cdot \Delta P}{\mu \cdot L} \]

Since we are looking for the flow rate per unit area, \( A \) cancels out, and we are left with:

\[ q = \frac{k \cdot \Delta P}{\mu} \]

We are given the permeability in terms of Darcy's (1 Darcy ≈ 0.987 x 10⁻¹² m²), but we need to convert it to m⁴/(N·s) using the viscosity of water at room temperature (approximately 1 x 10⁻³ Pa·s):

\[ k = 0.8 \text{ m}^4/(\text{N} \cdot \text{s}) \]

Now we can plug in the values:

\[ q = \frac{0.8 \text{ m}^4/(\text{N} \cdot \text{s}) \cdot 2940 \text{ Pa}}{1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ Pa} \cdot \text{s}} \]
\[ q = \frac{0.8 \cdot 2940}{1 \times 10^{-3}} \]
\[ q = \frac{2352}{0.001} \]
\[ q = 2352000 \text{ m/s} \]

However, this value seems excessively high for a flow rate, indicating a mistake in the calculations. Let's re-evaluate the permeability conversion. Since the permeability is already given in the correct units (m⁴/(N·s)), we do not need to convert it using the viscosity of water. The mistake was in not accounting for the bed height \( L \) in the original calculation. The hydraulic gradient \( dh/dx \) is the pressure drop per unit length of the bed, which is already given as 300 mm of water per meter of bed height.

If the volume of the mold cavity is 10 $m^3$, then the time(in seconds) required to fill the mold is?(roound off to nearest integer)","To solve this problem, we can use the principles of fluid mechanics. Since we are ignoring fluid friction and drag, we can consider the flow to be ideal and use the equations for free fall and volume flow rate to determine the time required to fill the mold.

1. First, we calculate the velocity of the liquid metal as it enters the mold cavity. The liquid metal is accelerating due to gravity from a height of 0.5 m. We can use the kinematic equation for free fall:

   \( v = \sqrt{2gh} \)

   where:
   - \( v \) is the velocity of the liquid metal upon impact,
   - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 \( m.s^{-2} \)),
   - \( h \) is the height from which the liquid metal falls (0.5 m).

   Plugging in the values, we get:

   \( v = \sqrt{9.8} \)
   \( v \approx 3.13 \) \( m.s^{-1} \)

2. Next, we calculate the volume flow rate (\( Q \)) using the velocity (\( v \)) and the cross-sectional area (\( A \)) of the gate:

   \( Q = Av \)

   where:
   - \( Q \) is the volume flow rate,
   - \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the gate (0.2 \( m^2 \)),
   - \( v \) is the velocity of the liquid metal (3.13 \( m.s^{-1} \)).

   Plugging in the values, we get:

   \( Q = 0.2 \times 3.13 \)
   \( Q = 0.626 \) \( m^3.s^{-1} \)

3. Finally, we calculate the time (\( t \)) required to fill the mold cavity with a volume (\( V \)) of 10 \( m^3 \):

   where:
   - \( t \) is the time in seconds,
   - \( V \) is the volume of the mold cavity (10 \( m^3 \)),
   - \( Q \) is the volume flow rate (0.626 \( m^3.s^{-1} \)).

   Plugging in the values, we get:

Fluid,9,G-META-21-34,MCQS,78,"For a fully developed 1-D flow of Newtonian fluid through a horizontal pipe of radius R (see figure), the axial velocity ($v_z$) is given by: $v_z$ = [ΔP/L]*({$R^2$ - $r^2$}/4µ), where ΔP is the pressure difference (P1- P2), µ is the viscosity, r is the radial distance from the axis and L is the length of the tube. The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is:  (A) ΔPR/(2L) (B) ΔPR/L (C) 3ΔPR/(2L) (D) 2ΔPR/L","To find the shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall, we need to calculate the derivative of the velocity profile with respect to the radial distance r at the wall of the pipe (where r = R). The shear stress τ is given by:

τ = µ * (dv_z/dr)

Given the velocity profile:

v_z = [ΔP/L] * ({R^2 - r^2}/4µ)

Let's first find the derivative of v_z with respect to r:

dv_z/dr = d/dr [{ΔP/L} * ({R^2 - r^2}/4µ)]
       = (ΔP/L) * (-2r/4µ)
       = -(ΔP/L) * (r/(2µ))

Now, we evaluate this derivative at r = R to find the shear stress at the wall:

τ_wall = µ * (-(ΔP/L) * (R/(2µ)))
       = -(ΔP/L) * (R/2)

The negative sign indicates that the shear stress is in the opposite direction to the increase in r, which makes sense since the shear stress acts towards the center of the pipe. However, we are typically interested in the magnitude of the shear stress, so we can ignore the negative sign:

τ_wall = (ΔP/L) * (R/2)

(Note: B is the center of the sphere and the straight horizontal line OAB intersects the surface of the sphere at the point A.)

(A) The velocity of the fluid at the point A is zero.
This statement is true. Due to the no-slip condition in fluid dynamics, the velocity of the fluid at the surface of a solid object must be zero relative to the object. Since the sphere is non-rotating and smooth, the fluid will stick to the surface of the sphere and have a velocity of zero at point A.

(B) The fluid pressure at the point A exceeds that at point O by the amount 𝜌$v^2$/2, where 𝒗 is the fluid velocity at point O.
This statement is false. While Bernoulli's principle suggests that an increase in velocity is associated with a decrease in pressure, and vice versa, the statement as given is incorrect. The pressure difference between points A and O is not simply 𝜌$v^2$/2. Instead, the pressure difference can be described by the Bernoulli equation, which takes into account the dynamic pressure (𝜌$v^2$/2) and the hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of the fluid column above). However, since the flow is horizontal and the fluid is incompressible, the hydrostatic pressure is the same at points A and O, and the dynamic pressure at point A is zero because the velocity there is zero. Therefore, the pressure at point A is actually higher than at point O due to the stagnation of flow at A, but the exact pressure difference is not given by the equation in the statement.

(C) Fluid moving precisely along OA will turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object.
This statement is false. In an inviscid fluid, the fluid particles would follow the streamlines, which would bend around the sphere smoothly. The fluid would not turn abruptly perpendicular to OA but would instead flow around the sphere, creating a symmetric flow pattern around the central streamline OA.

(D) On each side of the central streamline OA, the flow will be deflected round the object.
This statement is true. Since the fluid cannot penetrate the solid sphere, the streamlines on either side of the central streamline OA will be deflected around the sphere. The flow will separate at some point downstream of the sphere, but upstream and around the sphere, the streamlines will bend to pass around the object.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer(s) is(are):

Fluid,12,G-META-13-47,NUM,61,"[Given: density of steel = 7000 kg/$m^3$ , density of alumina = 3650 kg/$m^3$ , viscosity of steel = 6*$10^(-3)$ kg/m/s]. Ladle deoxidation of liquid steel is done at 1600°C by adding ferro-aluminium. By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?","To solve this problem, we can use Stokes' law, which relates the settling velocity of a spherical particle in a fluid to the particle's characteristics and the fluid's properties. Stokes' law is given by:

\[ v = \frac{g \cdot d^2 \cdot (\rho_p - \rho_f)}{18 \cdot \mu} \]

where:
- \( v \) is the terminal velocity of the particle (m/s),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²),
- \( d \) is the diameter of the particle (m),
- \( \rho_p \) is the density of the particle (kg/m³),
- \( \rho_f \) is the density of the fluid (kg/m³),
- \( \mu \) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s or kg/m/s).

Given:
- \( \rho_{steel} = 7000 \) kg/m³ (density of steel),
- \( \rho_{alumina} = 3650 \) kg/m³ (density of alumina),
- \( \mu_{steel} = 6 \times 10^{-3} \) kg/m/s (viscosity of steel),
- \( d = 50 \) µm = \( 50 \times 10^{-6} \) m (diameter of alumina particles),
- \( h = 2 \) m (depth from which the particles need to float).

First, we need to convert the diameter of the alumina particles from micrometers to meters:
\[ d = 50 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} \]

Now, we can plug the values into Stokes' law to find the terminal velocity of the alumina particles in liquid steel:
\[ v = \frac{9.81 \cdot (50 \times 10^{-6})^2 \cdot (3650 - 7000)}{18 \cdot 6 \times 10^{-3}} \]

\[ v = \frac{9.81 \cdot 2500 \times 10^{-12} \cdot (-3350)}{18 \cdot 6 \times 10^{-3}} \]

\[ v = \frac{-210225 \times 10^{-12}}{108 \times 10^{-3}} \]

\[ v = -1946.5238 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m/s} \]

The negative sign indicates that the particles are moving upwards, which is what we expect since they are less dense than the steel and are floating to the surface.

Now, to find the time required for the particles to float to the surface, we use the formula:
\[ t = \frac{h}{v} \]

\[ t = \frac{2}{-1946.5238 \times 10^{-9}} \]

\[ t = -1027888.636 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s} \]

\[ t \approx -1028 \text{ s} \]

Since time cannot be negative (it indicates the direction of movement), we take the absolute value of the time:
\[ t \approx 1028 \text{ s} \]

So, the time required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m is approximately:

Fluid,13,G-META-18-45,NUM,75,"Assume Stokes law; i.e., drag force $𝐹_𝑑$ = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣, where 𝜇 is the viscosity of steel.

The terminal velocity(in mm$s^(-1)$ to two decimal places) (𝑣) of a spherical inclusion of diameter D = 50 micrometers rising in liquid steel is?","To find the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion rising in liquid steel, we can use Stokes' law, which states that the drag force \( F_d \) acting on a sphere moving through a fluid is given by:

\[ F_d = 3\pi\mu D v \]

where:
- \( \mu \) is the viscosity of the fluid (liquid steel in this case),
- \( D \) is the diameter of the sphere (the inclusion),
- \( v \) is the terminal velocity of the sphere.

At terminal velocity, the drag force is equal to the gravitational force minus the buoyant force, which can be expressed as:

\[ F_d = \frac{4}{3}\pi\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^3 g (\rho_{inclusion} - \rho_{steel}) \]

where:
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( \rho_{inclusion} \) is the density of the inclusion,
- \( \rho_{steel} \) is the density of the liquid steel.

Setting the two expressions for \( F_d \) equal to each other gives us:

\[ 3\pi\mu D v = \frac{4}{3}\pi\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^3 g (\rho_{inclusion} - \rho_{steel}) \]

Solving for \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^3 g (\rho_{inclusion} - \rho_{steel})}{3\pi\mu D} \]

Simplifying the equation by canceling out common terms:

\[ v = \frac{2 g (\rho_{inclusion} - \rho_{steel}) D^2}{18\mu} \]

Now we can plug in the given values:
- \( \rho_{inclusion} = 2500 \text{ kg m}^{-3} \)
- \( \rho_{steel} = 7900 \text{ kg m}^{-3} \)
- \( g = 9.8 \text{ m s}^{-2} \)
- \( \mu = 0.0079 \text{ Pa s} \)
- \( D = 50 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} \) (since 1 micrometer = \( 10^{-6} \) meters)

\[ v = \frac{2 \times 9.8 \times (2500 - 7900) \times (50 \times 10^{-6})^2}{18 \times 0.0079} \]

\[ v = \frac{2 \times 9.8 \times (-5400) \times 2500 \times 10^{-12}}{18 \times 0.0079} \]

\[ v = \frac{-26460000 \times 10^{-12}}{0.1422} \]

\[ v = -186.06 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m s}^{-1} \]

Since the velocity is negative, it indicates that the inclusion is actually falling, not rising. To express the velocity in mm/s, we convert meters to millimeters (1 m = 1000 mm):

\[ v = -186.06 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m s}^{-1} \times 1000 \text{ mm m}^{-1} \]

\[ v = -0.18606 \text{ mm s}^{-1} \]

Rounded to two decimal places:

\[ v = -0.19 \text{ mm s}^{-1} \]

The negative sign indicates that the inclusion is moving downwards. So the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion rising (or rather, falling) in liquid steel is:

\[ \boxed{-0.19 \text{ mm s}^{-1}} \]

Please note that the context provided was ""None,"" but the question itself contained all the necessary information to solve the problem. The answer is negative because the inclusion is denser than the liquid steel and thus sinks. If the inclusion were less dense than the steel, the sign would be positive, indicating that it would rise.

The answer is: -0.19 \text{ mm s}^{-1}.",,,0,

1. Liquid Penetration Test: This method uses a visible or fluorescent dye to detect surface-breaking defects in materials. It is not suitable for detecting internal flaws because it only highlights discontinuities that are open to the surface.

2. Radiography: This technique uses X-rays or gamma rays to create an image of the internal structure of an object. It is very effective for detecting internal flaws in a variety of materials, including ceramics.

3. Ultrasonic Testing: Ultrasonic waves are sent into the material, and internal flaws are detected by monitoring the reflections (echoes) from the waves. This method is highly effective for finding internal flaws in many materials, including ceramics.

4. Eddy Current Method: This method relies on the induction of eddy currents in conductive materials. The presence of flaws affects the flow of the eddy currents, which can be detected. However, ceramics are generally non-conductive, making this method inapplicable for detecting internal flaws in ceramic materials.

(A) Pre- and post-cleaning of parts are not required - This statement is incorrect. Pre-cleaning is essential to remove any contaminants that could prevent the penetrant from entering defects, and post-cleaning is necessary to remove the penetrant from the surface after the test.

(B) Internal defects can be detected - This statement is generally incorrect. Dye-penetrant testing is primarily used to detect surface-breaking defects. It is not effective for detecting internal defects that do not break the surface.

(C) Surface oxides helps in crack identification - This statement is incorrect. Surface oxides can actually interfere with the dye-penetrant test by preventing the penetrant from entering the cracks or by hiding the indications of defects.

(D) Dye with low contact angle is required - This statement is correct. A low contact angle means the liquid (in this case, the dye) wets the surface well, which is important for the penetrant to effectively enter into surface defects. A high contact angle would indicate poor wetting, which would make the penetrant less effective at revealing defects.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is:

Miscellaneous,3,G-XEC-2019-1,MCQS,30,On decreasing the objective aperture size in an optical microscope  (A) the spherical aberration increases (B) the depth of field increases (C) the diffraction-limited resolution increases (D) the astigmatism increases,"The question pertains to the effects of changing the objective aperture size in an optical microscope. Let's analyze each option:

(A) the spherical aberration increases - Decreasing the objective aperture size can actually reduce spherical aberration because it blocks the most aberrated rays at the edge of the lens. However, if the aperture is made too small, diffraction effects become more significant, which can affect the image quality in a way that might be confused with increased aberration.

(B) the depth of field increases - This is correct. Decreasing the aperture size increases the depth of field in an optical system. A smaller aperture means a larger f-number (f/stop), which results in a greater depth of field, making more of the scene in focus.

(C) the diffraction-limited resolution increases - This is incorrect. The diffraction-limited resolution is determined by the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective and the wavelength of light used. Decreasing the aperture size decreases the NA, which in turn decreases the diffraction-limited resolution.

(D) the astigmatism increases - Decreasing the aperture size generally does not affect astigmatism, which is a defect caused by the lens not being perfectly symmetrical. Astigmatism is independent of the aperture size.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

- [ ] (A) the spherical aberration increases
- [x] (B) the depth of field increases
- [ ] (C) the diffraction-limited resolution increases
- [ ] (D) the astigmatism increases",,,0,
Miscellaneous,4,G-XEC-2020-2,MCQS,46,Smallest of minimum feature size that can be theoretically resolved in an optical microscope does NOT depend on:  (A) Refractive index of the medium between the lens and the focal point (B) Intensityh of radiation (C) Wavelength of radiation (D) Numerical aperture of the objective lens,"The smallest feature size that can be theoretically resolved in an optical microscope is commonly described by the Rayleigh criterion or the Abbe diffraction limit. According to these criteria, the resolution limit (d) is given by:

\[ d = \frac{0.61 \lambda}{NA} \]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light used for imaging,
- \( NA \) is the numerical aperture of the objective lens.

From this formula, we can deduce that the resolution depends on:
- The wavelength of radiation (\( \lambda \)): Shorter wavelengths lead to better resolution.
- The numerical aperture of the objective lens (\( NA \)): Higher numerical apertures lead to better resolution.

However, the resolution does not directly depend on:
- The refractive index of the medium between the lens and the focal point: While the refractive index affects the numerical aperture, it is not an independent factor in the resolution equation. The numerical aperture itself accounts for the refractive index and the angle of acceptance.
- The intensity of radiation: While higher intensity can improve image quality and contrast, it does not affect the theoretical resolution limit of the microscope.

Therefore, the smallest of minimum feature size that can be theoretically resolved in an optical microscope does NOT depend on:
- (B) Intensity of radiation
- (A) Refractive index of the medium between the lens and the focal point (since it is indirectly accounted for by the numerical aperture)

Given the options provided:

- (A) Refractive index of the medium between the lens and the focal point
- (B) Intensity of radiation
- (C) Wavelength of radiation
- (D) Numerical aperture of the objective lens

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{[\text{(B) Intensity of radiation}]} \]

Note: The refractive index of the medium is embedded within the numerical aperture (NA) calculation, so while it doesn't explicitly appear in the resolution formula, it is implicitly included in the NA term. Option (A) could be considered correct in a strict sense if we are only considering the formula's explicit variables, but in the context of the underlying physics and the way NA is defined, the refractive index does influence the resolution. Option (B) is the best answer among the choices given.",,,0,

Miscellaneous,6,G-META-17-39,NUM,36,"A solution contains $10^(-3)$ M of $Fe^(+3)$ at 25°C. The solubility product of $Fe(OH)_3$ is $10^(-39)$. Assuming activity equals concentration, the minimum pH at which $Fe^(+3)$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is?(answer up to two decimals places)","To determine the minimum pH at which \(Fe^{3+}\) will precipitate as \(Fe(OH)_3\), we need to consider the solubility product constant (\(K_{sp}\)) for \(Fe(OH)_3\). The solubility product expression for \(Fe(OH)_3\) is:

\[ [Fe^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = K_{sp} \]

Given that \(K_{sp} = 10^{-39}\) and \([Fe^{3+}] = 10^{-3}\) M, we can solve for the concentration of \(OH^-\) ions at the point of precipitation:

\[ [OH^-]^3 = \frac{K_{sp}}{[Fe^{3+}]} \]
\[ [OH^-]^3 = \frac{10^{-39}}{10^{-3}} \]
\[ [OH^-]^3 = 10^{-36} \]
\[ [OH^-] = \sqrt[3]{10^{-36}} \]
\[ [OH^-] = 10^{-12} \text{ M} \]

Now, we know that at 25°C, the ionic product of water (\(K_w\)) is \(10^{-14}\), and the relationship between \(OH^-\) and \(H^+\) concentrations is:

\[ [OH^-][H^+] = K_w \]
\[ [H^+] = \frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} \]
\[ [H^+] = \frac{10^{-14}}{10^{-12}} \]
\[ [H^+] = 10^{-2} \text{ M} \]

To find the pH, we take the negative logarithm of the \(H^+\) concentration:

\[ pH = -\log[H^+] \]
\[ pH = -\log(10^{-2}) \]
\[ pH = 2 \]

Therefore, the minimum pH at which \(Fe^{3+}\) will precipitate as \(Fe(OH)_3\) is 2.00.

Miscellaneous,7,G-META-20-44,NUM,41,"Given, density of oxide is 6.5 $g.cm^(-3)$. A metal oxidizes at 1200K with a parabolic rate constant of 3* $10^(-6)g^(2).cm^(-4).s^(-1)$. Time taken(in seconds) for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is?(round off to two decimal places). ","To solve this problem, we can use the equation for parabolic oxidation, which is given by:

\[ (x/x_0)^2 = k t \]

where:
- \( x \) is the thickness of the oxide layer,
- \( x_0 \) is a constant related to the density and molar mass of the oxide (but since we're not given the molar mass, we'll use the density directly in our calculation),
- \( k \) is the parabolic rate constant,
- \( t \) is the time in seconds.

We are given:
- \( k = 3 \times 10^{-6} g^2 \cdot cm^{-4} \cdot s^{-1} \),
- \( x = 2 \mu m = 2 \times 10^{-4} cm \) (since 1 µm = \( 10^{-6} m \) and 1 cm = \( 10^{-2} m \)),
- Density of oxide = \( 6.5 g \cdot cm^{-3} \).

First, we need to find \( x_0 \). The value of \( x_0 \) can be determined from the initial growth of the oxide layer, but since we're not given the molar mass or any other information to calculate \( x_0 \) directly, we'll use the density of the oxide to relate the mass of the oxide to its volume.

The mass of the oxide layer \( m \) can be calculated by:

\[ m = \text{density} \times \text{volume} \]

Since the volume of the oxide layer is the product of its surface area \( A \) and thickness \( x \), we have:

\[ m = \text{density} \times A \times x \]

For a given surface area \( A \), the mass of the oxide layer is proportional to the thickness \( x \), and we can write:

\[ m = \text{constant} \times x \]

This constant is related to \( x_0 \), and since we're dealing with a parabolic rate law, we can assume that \( x_0 \) is proportional to the square root of this constant. Therefore, we can write:

\[ x_0^2 = \frac{1}{\text{density}} \]

Now we can substitute \( x_0 \) into our original parabolic oxidation equation:

\[ (x/x_0)^2 = k t \]

\[ t = \frac{(x/x_0)^2}{k} \]

\[ t = \frac{x^2 \times \text{density}}{k} \]

\[ t = \frac{(2 \times 10^{-4} cm)^2 \times 6.5 g \cdot cm^{-3}}{3 \times 10^{-6} g^2 \cdot cm^{-4} \cdot s^{-1}} \]

\[ t = \frac{4 \times 10^{-8} cm^2 \times 6.5 g \cdot cm^{-3}}{3 \times 10^{-6} g^2 \cdot cm^{-4} \cdot s^{-1}} \]

\[ t = \frac{2.6 \times 10^{-7} g \cdot cm^{-1}}{3 \times 10^{-6} g^2 \cdot cm^{-4} \cdot s^{-1}} \]

\[ t = \frac{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}{3 \times 10^{-6} \times 2 \times 10^{-4}} \]

\[ t = \frac{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}{6 \times 10^{-10}} \]

\[ t = 4.3333 \times 10^{2} s \]

Rounding off to two decimal places, we get:

\[ t = 433.33 s \]

So the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is approximately:

- 433.33 seconds
