First, calculate the volume of the unit cell:
Volume = (Lattice parameter)^3 = (0.4nm)^3 = 0.064 nm^3

Next, calculate the mass of the unit cell:
Mass = Density x Volume = 19000 kg.$m^(-3)$ x 0.064 nm^3 = 1216 kg

Then, calculate the number of atoms in the unit cell:
Mass of 1 atom = Atomic weight / Avogadro's number = 183 / 6.022 x 10^23 = 3.04 x 10^(-22) kg
Number of atoms = Mass of unit cell / Mass of 1 atom = 1216 kg / 3.04 x 10^(-22) kg = 4 atoms

For the same alloy, when engineering strain is 0.12 then the engineering stress(in MPa) is? (round off to the nearest integer)","
The engineering stress can be calculated using the relationship between true stress and true strain:

𝜎 = K * 𝜀^n

Given that when true strain 𝜀 = 0.05, true stress 𝜎 = 350 MPa:
350 = K * 0.05^n

Solving for K:
K = 350 / 0.05^n

Now, when engineering strain 𝜀 = 0.12:
𝜎 = K * (𝜀 / n)^(1/n)
𝜎 = (350 / 0.05^n) * (0.12 / n)^(1/n)

Calculating the engineering stress for n = 0.05:
K = 350 / 0.05^0.05
K ≈ 350 / 0.8604
K ≈ 406.47

𝜎 = 406.47 * (0.12 / 0.05)^(1/0.05)
𝜎 = 406.47 * 2.4^20
𝜎 ≈ 406.47 * 1.1487

Explanation: The pressure required for the transformation from α to β at a certain temperature can be calculated using the Clapeyron equation:

1. Calculate the initial mass of the iron plate:
Initial mass = Density x Volume
Density of iron = 7870 kg/m^3
Volume = Surface area x Thickness
Surface area = 50 cm^2 = 0.005 m^2
Assuming the thickness is negligible for this calculation
Initial mass = 7870 kg/m^3 x 0.005 m^2 = 39.35 g = 0.03935 kg

2. Calculate the corrosion rate:
Corrosion rate = (Initial mass - Final mass) / (Surface area x Time)
Final mass = Initial mass - 200 g = 0.03935 kg - 0.2 kg = 0.01935 kg
Time = 10 years = 10 years x 365 days/year x 24 hours/day x 3600 seconds/hour = 315360000 seconds
Corrosion rate = (0.03935 kg - 0.01935 kg) / (0.005 m^2 x 315360000 s) = 0.02 kg / (0.005 m^2 x 315360000 s) = 0.08 kg.m^2.year^-1
