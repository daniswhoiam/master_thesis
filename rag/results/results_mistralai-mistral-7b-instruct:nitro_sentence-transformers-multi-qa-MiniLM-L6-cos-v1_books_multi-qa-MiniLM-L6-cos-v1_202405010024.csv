However, it is important to note that none of the materials mentioned in the context of the question are directly stated to be suitable for an LED emitting at 380 nm. The context primarily discusses the suitability of various materials for LEDs in general and for lasers specifically. The information provided suggests that direct bandgap materials are more suitable for LEDs due to their higher quantum efficiency for the emission of light. However, the context also mentions that indirect bandgap materials with small bandgaps, such as silicon, can emit efficiently in the blue and green spectral range through spark-processing. Therefore, while indirect bandgap materials with small bandgaps are not the most common choice for LEDs, they could potentially be suitable for an LED emitting at 380 nm.

Thermodynamics,4,G-XEC-2013-15,NUM,29,"The band gap of a semiconducting material used to make an LED is 1.43 eV. What will be the minimum wavelength ofthe radiation emitted by this LED, in μm?","To find the minimum wavelength of radiation emitted by an LED with a band gap of 1.43 eV, we can use the relationship between energy and wavelength:

E = hc / λ

where E is the energy (in eV), h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength (in meters).

First, we need to convert the energy to joules:

1.43 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J / eV x 1.43 eV = 2.35 x 10^-19 J

Next, we can calculate the wavelength:

λ = hc / E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s x 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.35 x 10^-19 J) = 621.5 nm

Finally, we can convert the wavelength to micrometers:

λ = 621.5 nm x 10^-9 m / 1 μm = 621.5 μm

So, the minimum wavelength of radiation emitted by the LED is approximately 621.5 μm or 622 nm.",,,0,

Explanation:

The context provided in the text states that the typical barrier potential for a silicon p-n junction at room temperature is 1.12 Volts (V). However, the question asks for the typical barrier potential, which is usually given as a smaller value, specifically the ideal barrier potential in the absence of doping effects.

Explanation: At low injection levels in a forward-biased p-n junction, the minority carriers (injected holes in the n-region and injected electrons in the p-region) have a higher concentration compared to the majority carriers due to the injection process. This is because the minority carriers are injected from the lower concentration region into the higher concentration region, leading to an excess concentration of minority carriers near the junction.",,,0,

If 100 g of water that is at 90 °C is added to the cup, the final temperature of water in °C is"," To find the final temperature of the water in the copper cup after adding 100 g of water at 90 °C, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. First, let's calculate the initial and final masses and energies of the system.

Initial mass of water = 80 g
Initial energy of water = m\_i \* c\_pw \* T\_i
= 80 g \* 4.18 J/g °C \* 4 °C
= 299.2 J

Initial mass of copper = 140 g
Initial energy of copper = m\_i \* c\_pc \* T\_i
= 140 g \* 0.385 J/g °C \* 4 °C
= 11.43 J

Total initial energy = Initial energy of water + Initial energy of copper
= 310.63 J

Final mass of water = 160 g (80 g + 100 g)
Final energy of water = m\_f \* c\_pw \* T\_f

We need to find T\_f, so we'll use the principle of conservation of energy:

Total initial energy = Total final energy

Initial energy of water + Initial energy of copper + Energy added = Final energy of water

299.2 J + 11.43 J + Q = m\_f \* c\_pw \* T\_f

We know that Q = m\_h \* c\_ph \* (T\_h - T\_f), where m\_h = 100 g and c\_ph = 4.18 J/g °C.

Substituting the values:

299.2 J + 11.43 J + 100 g \* 4.18 J/g °C \* (90 °C - T\_f) = 160 g \* 4.18 J/g °C \* T\_f

Now we have an equation with one variable, T\_f. Solving it will give us the final temperature of the water.

T\_f = (299.2 J + 11.43 J + 4180 J) / (160 g \* 4.18 J/g °C + 4.18 J/g °C \* 160 g)

T\_f ≈ 43.5 °C

1 λ = R y(1 (n − d 1)2 −1 (m − d 2)2)

Since m and d are both equal to 0 for hydrogen, we have:

1 λ = R y(1 (4 − 2)2) = R y(1 (2) × 16) = R y(16)

The Rydberg constant Ry is equal to 1312 eV·nm, so:

1 λ = 1312 eV·nm ÷ 1 eV = 1312 nm

To find the wavelength in μm, we need to convert nanometers to micrometers:

1 λ = 1312 nm × 106 nm/μm = 1312000 μm

Now, and the energy in eV is:

E = 1312 eV·nm ÷ 1312 nm = 1 eV

Calculate the original length of the iron rail track in cm. (linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$)"," To calculate the original length of the iron rail track, we can use the given information about the change in length and the linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron. The formula for linear thermal expansion is:

Thermodynamics,14,G-XEC-2015-65-22,NUM,32,What would be the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV. The band gap of silicon is 1.1 eV.," To find the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV, we first need to determine the number of photons absorbed per unit time and per unit area, and then find the quantum conversion efficiency.

1. Calculate the number of photons absorbed per unit time and per unit area using Eq. ( 8.12 ) from the text:

Φ₁ = I₀/ℏω

where I₀ is the initial light intensity, ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant, and ω is the angular frequency.

First, we need to find the energy of the photon in electron volts (eV) and then convert it to joules (J) for the calculation.

1.54 keV = 1.54 × 10³ eV = 1.54 × 10⁹ J/mol × 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹/m³ × (1 eV/1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J)

Energy of the photon = 9.109 × 10¹⁴ J/m²

Now, we can calculate the number of photons absorbed per unit time and per unit area:

Φ₁ = I₀/ℏω

Φ₁ = (9.109 × 10¹⁴ J/m²)/(6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ Js) × (2πc/λ)²

Φ₁ = (9.109 × 10¹⁴ J/m²)/(6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ Js) × (2π × 3 × 10⁸ m/s)²/(1.54 × 10⁻⁹ m)²

Φ₁ ≈ 1.13 × 10²⁵ photons/m²s

2. Calculate the quantum conversion efficiency (η) for silicon:

η = 10% (given in the text)

3. Calculate the rate of generation of carriers (g) using Eq. ( 8.63 ) from the text:

g = ηI₀/ℏωd

First, we need to find the thickness of the semiconductor (d) for which all radiation is absorbed. Since the energy of the photon is less than the band gap of silicon (1.1 eV), we assume that all radiation is absorbed.

The absorption coefficient (α) for silicon at 1.54 keV is approximately 10⁶ m⁻¹ (given in the text).

Using Beer-Lambert Law, we can find the thickness of the semiconductor:

I = I₀e⁻αxd

ln(I₀/I) = αxd

x = ln(I₀/I)/α

x = ln(1/0.1) / (10⁶ m⁻¹)

x ≈ 2.2 × 10⁻⁶ m

Since the given thickness is not provided, we assume that it is large enough for all radiation to be absorbed.

Now, we can calculate the rate of generation of carriers:

g = ηI₀/ℏωd

g = 0.1 × 1.13 × 10²⁵ photons/m²s / (6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹/m³) × (1 eV/1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) × (1 J/1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) × (1 C/1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²) × (2.2 × 10⁻⁶ m)²

Thermodynamics,15,G-XEC-2016-3,MCQS,23,Which of the following thermodynamic properties shows a discontinuity during a second-order phase transition?  (A) Volume (B) Enthalpy (C) Entropy (D) Heat capacity,"None of the given options (A, B, C, D) shows a discontinuity during a second-order phase transition. However, the context mentions that the heat capacity diverges at a second-order phase transition point. Therefore, the correct answer would be:

Answer: [D] Heat capacity

Explanation:
Although the question asks which property shows a discontinuity during a second-order phase transition, the context provides information about the divergence of the heat capacity at a second-order phase transition point. This is an important distinction, as a divergence is not the same as a discontinuity. A discontinuity implies a sudden and sharp change in a property, while a divergence indicates that the property approaches infinity or becomes infinite at a certain point. In this case, the heat capacity diverges at the second-order phase transition point, meaning that it approaches infinity as the temperature or pressure approaches the critical value.

So, while none of the given options (A, B, C) shows a discontinuity during a second-order phase transition, the heat capacity (option D) diverges at the second-order phase transition point.",,,0,

Explanation:

The Fermi energy in a metal is the energy level at which the probability of occupancy by electrons is 0.5, or 50%. This is because half of the available energy levels are filled with electrons at the Fermi energy, and the other half are empty. Therefore, the answer is [C, 0.5].",,,0,

A direct bandgap semiconductor has a bandgap of 1.8 eV. The threshold value of the wavelength(in Å) BELOW which this material will absorb radiation is","To find the threshold wavelength below which the material will absorb radiation, we need to use the relationship between energy, wavelength, and frequency. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. We want to find the wavelength, so we can rearrange the equation to solve for λ:

λ = hc/E

Substituting the given values, we have:

λ = (6.626 * $10^(−34)$ J s) * (3 * $10^8$ m/s) / (1.8 eV * $1.6 * 10^(−19)$ C)

First, we need to convert the energy to Joules:

1.8 eV = 1.8 * $1.6 * 10^(−19)$ J

Now we can substitute the values into the equation:

λ = (6.626 * $10^(−34)$ J s) * (3 * $10^8$ m/s) / (1.8 * $1.6 * 10^(−19)$ J)

Thermodynamics,20,G-XEC-2018-18,NUM,42,"When 3 identical non-interacting spin ½ particles are put in an infinite potential well, the ground state energy of the system is 18 meV. If instead, seven particles are put inside the potential well, the new ground state energy in meV is?"," To find the ground state energy of the system with seven particles, we can use the result for three particles and add the energy of four additional particles in the same potential well.

The energy of three particles in the ground state of an infinite potential well is given by:

E = 3 * 13.606 eV = 13.606 eV * 3 = 40.818 eV

Since the energy of an infinite potential well for a single particle is given by:

E = (h^2 * pi^2) / (2 * m * L^2)

We can convert the given ground state energy of 18 meV to eV for consistency:

18 meV = 0.018 eV

Now, we can find the energy of one particle in the potential well:

E = (h^2 * pi^2) / (2 * m * L^2) = 13.606 eV

The energy of four additional particles will be the same as that of one particle:

E_4 = 4 * E = 4 * 13.606 eV = 54.424 eV

The total ground state energy of the system with seven particles will be the sum of the energy of three particles and the energy of four additional particles:

E_7 = E_3 + E_4 = 40.818 eV + 54.424 eV = 95.242 eV

To convert the energy back to meV, we can multiply it by 1000:

95.242 eV * 1000 = 95,242 meV

So, the ground state energy of the system with seven identical non-interacting spin ½ particles in an infinite potential well is approximately 95,242 meV.",,,0,
Thermodynamics,21,G-XEC-2018-22,NUM,59,"Given: Activation energy Q = 148 kJ $mol^(-1)$, Gas constant, R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)$ $K^(-1)$. Mild steel is carburized at 1300 K for 1 hour to obtain a certain case depth. Keeping the time as 1 hour, the case depth can be doubled by increasing the temperature to what temperature(in K)? (round off to the nearest whole number)"," To find the temperature at which the case depth can be doubled while keeping the time constant, we can use the following equation for the relationship between activation energy, temperature, and reaction rate:

k = Ae^(-Q/RT)

where k is the reaction rate, A is the frequency factor, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Q is the activation energy.

Since we want to double the reaction rate (and thus the case depth), we need to find the temperature that gives a reaction rate twice the original rate:

k_new = 2k_original

Substituting the original reaction rate k_original into the equation for k, we get:

k_original = Ae^(-Q/RT_original)

To find k_new, we need to set k_new = 2k_original:

k_new = 2(Ae^(-Q/RT_original))

Now, we want to find T_new such that k_new = k_original * 2:

Ae^(-Q/RT_new) = 2(Ae^(-Q/RT_original))

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(Ae^(-Q/RT_new)) = ln(2) + ln(Ae^(-Q/RT_original))

Using the property of logarithms:

ln(Ae^(-Q/RT_new)) = ln(2) + ln(A) + ln(e^(-Q/RT_original))

Since ln(A) is a constant, we can ignore it:

ln(e^(-Q/RT_new)) = ln(2) + ln(e^(-Q/RT_original))

Using the property of logarithms again:

ln(-Q/RT_new) = ln(-Q/RT_original) + ln(2)

Taking the exponential of both sides:

e^(ln(-Q/RT_new)) = e^(ln(-Q/RT_original) + ln(2))

Using the property of exponents:

e^(ln(-Q/RT_new)) = e^(ln(-Q/RT_original)) * e^(ln(2))

Simplifying:

e^(-Q/RT_new) = e^(-Q/RT_original) * e^(ln(2))

Using the value of e^(ln(2)) = 2:

e^(-Q/RT_new) = 2 * e^(-Q/RT_original)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides again:

ln(2 * e^(-Q/RT_original)) = ln(e^(-Q/RT_new))

Using the property of logarithms:

ln(2) + ln(e^(-Q/RT_original)) = ln(e^(-Q/RT_new))

Simplifying:

ln(2) + ln(-Q/RT_original) = ln(-Q/RT_new)

Using the property of logarithms again:

ln(2) + ln(-Q/RT_original) = ln(-Q/RT_new) = ln(-Q/RT_original) + ln(RT_new/RT_original)

Simplifying:

ln(2) + ln(RT_new/RT_original) = 0

Taking the exponential of both sides:

2 = RT_new/RT_original

Multiplying both sides by RT_original:

2 * RT_original = RT_new

2 * 8.314 J/mol*K * 1300 K = RT_new

Calculating RT_new:

RT_new = 2 * 8.314 J/mol*K * 1300 K = 27982.8 J/mol

To find the temperature T_new in Kelvin, we need to divide RT_new by the gas constant R:

Using the chain rule, we have:

dU/dr = [−3A/r⁴ + 7B/r⁸]

Setting dU/dr = 0, we have:

−3A/r⁴ + 7B/r⁸ = 0

The maximum surface stress ($Crm$) during thermal cycling can be calculated using the given formula:

$$Crm = E \cdot \alpha \cdot \Delta T$$

where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion and $\Delta T$ is the temperature range during thermal cycling.

Given that $\Delta T = T\_f - 25^\circ C$, we have:

Rapid cooling reduces the time available for nuclei formation and delays the onset of freezing, which means that smaller nuclei are more likely to survive. Therefore, so, therefore, the answer is (B) smaller for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C.

The reason for this is that when the metal is cooled rapidly, there is less time for new nuclei to form and grow, so the existing nuclei must be smaller in order to reach the critical size required for stable growth. This effect is more pronounced at lower temperatures, so the critical size would be the smallest for solidification at 300 °C.

The absorption coefficient (α) of germanium at 1.3 µm is 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$.,"To find the thickness of a germanium crystal layer required for absorbing 80% of the incident radiation, we can use the Beer-Lambert law, which relates the absorption coefficient, thickness, and transmittance:

T = e^(-αx)

We want to find x, the thickness, given that T = 0.2 (1 - 0.8) = 0.04 (since 80% of the radiation is absorbed, the transmittance is 0.2).

First, we need to find α, the absorption coefficient in units of $m^-1$ to $cm^-1$ for consistency with the given thickness (in µm). We have:

α = 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^-1$ = 3.3 * $10^5$ * $10^4$ $cm^-1$ = 3.3 * $10^{19}$ $cm^-1$

Now, we can set up the equation:

ln(T/T0) = -αx

where T0 = 1 (assuming 100% incident radiation initially).

Solving for x:

x = ln(T/T0) / α

x = ln(0.04 / 1) / (3.3 * $10^{19}$ $cm^-1$)

x = ln(0.04) / (3.3 * $10^{19}$ $cm^-1$)

x = -ln(0.04) / (3.3 * $10^{19}$ $cm^-1$)

x = 1 / (3.3 * $10^{19}$ * ln(2.5))

The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is? (round off to 2 decimal places)","To find the percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K, we first need to calculate the change in length parallel and perpendicular to the graphite layers.

Let L0 be the original length of the graphite sample. The change in length parallel to the layers (ΔLpar) and perpendicular to the layers (ΔLperp) can be calculated using the given linear thermal expansion coefficients (αpar and αperp) and the temperature change (ΔT):

ΔLpar = αpar * L0 * ΔT
ΔLperp = αperp * L0 * ΔT

Now, we can calculate the change in volume (ΔV):

ΔV = ΔLpar * Apar + ΔLperp * Aperp

where Apar and Aperp are the areas of the areas of the graphite sample parallel and perpendicular to the layers, respectively. Since the graphite sample is assumed to be a rectangular prism, Apar = L0 * l (where l is the length of the sample in the direction perpendicular to the layers), and Aperp = L0 * w (where w is the width of the sample).

ΔV = (αpar * L0 * l + αperp * L0 * w) * ΔT

To find the percentage increase in volume, we divide the change in volume by the original volume and multiply by 100:

Percentage increase in volume = [(ΔV / (V0 = L0 * l * w))] * 100%

where V0 = L0 * l * w is the original volume of the graphite sample.

Substituting the given values, we have:

Percentage increase in volume = [((0.8 * 10^(−6) * L0 * l + 29 * 10^(−6) * L0 * w) * ΔT) / (L0 * l * w)] * 100%

To find the numerical value, we need to know the temperature change (ΔT) and the dimensions of the graphite sample (l and w).

Answer: [The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K depends on the dimensions of the graphite sample (l and w) and the temperature change (ΔT). The exact value cannot be determined from the given information.]

However, if we assume that the dimensions of the graphite sample are equal (l = w = L0), then we can write:

Percentage increase in volume = [((0.8 * 10^(−6) * L0^2 + 29 * 10^(−6) * L0^2) * ΔT) / (L0^3)] * 100%

Answer: [The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K, assuming equal dimensions, is approximately 1.18% for a temperature change of 200 K (ΔT = 100 K).]

(A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing"," The correct answer is D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing.

Explanation:

The goal is to deposit a thin metallic film on a $SiO_2$ substrate with an adhesion layer between the metal film and substrate, avoiding island type of growth. The optimization steps given in the question are:

A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film.
B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited.
C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate.
D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing.

The correct answer is D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing. This approach is beneficial for promoting good adhesion and uniformity of the deposited film. Intermittent deposition allows for the formation of a solid interfacial layer between the substrate and the deposited film, while annealing helps to relieve thermal stresses and promote interdiffusion between the adhesion layer and the substrate or the deposited film, leading to better adhesion and improved film quality.

The other options are not necessarily incorrect but may not be as effective as intermittent deposition and annealing for achieving the desired goal. For example, choosing a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (Option A) is important for good adhesion, but it is not the only factor that needs to be considered. Similarly, choosing a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$ (Option B) is important for ensuring good adhesion between the adhesion layer and the substrate, but it may not be sufficient to prevent island growth or ensure uniform deposition. Increasing the substrate temperature and decreasing the deposition rate (Option C) can help improve film quality and adhesion, but they may not be sufficient on their own to prevent island growth or ensure uniform deposition.",,,0,

The band gap(in ev) ($𝐸_g$) of the semiconductor is? (Round off to two decimals) ","To find the band gap of the semiconductor, we need to use the given relation for the number of electrons excited and the mass-action law equation. First, let's calculate the number of electrons excited:

$n\_e = N\_A \times exp(-{E\_g/k\_BT})$

We know that $N\_A = 6.02 \times 10^{23} \ mol^{-1}$, $k\_B = 8.62 \times 10^{-5} \ eV/K$, $T = 298 \ K$, and the resistivity of a pure semiconductor, $\rho = 3000 \ \Omega m$.

First, let's calculate the density of electrons and holes using the mass-action law equation:

$n\_0 \times p\_0 = n\_i^2$

We know that $n\_0$ is the density of electrons, $p\_0$ is the density of holes, and $n\_i$ is the intrinsic carrier density. Since we are given the resistivity of the semiconductor, we can calculate the intrinsic carrier density using the following relation:

$n\_i = \sqrt{N\_A \times N\_D} \times exp(-{E\_g/2k\_BT})$

where $N\_D$ is the doping concentration. Since we are dealing with a pure semiconductor, $N\_D = 0$.

Now, we can calculate the density of electrons and holes using the mass-action law equation:

$n\_0 \times p\_0 = n\_i^2 = 0$

Since the product of the densities of electrons and holes is zero for a pure semiconductor, we can't directly calculate the densities of electrons and holes. However, we can calculate the number of electrons excited using the given relation:

$n\_e = N\_A \times exp(-{E\_g/k\_BT})$

We want to find $E\_g$, so we need to rearrange the equation to solve for it:

$E\_g = -k\_B \times T \times ln(n\_e/N\_A)$

Substituting the given values:
values, we get:

$E\_g = -(8.62 \times 10^{-5} \ eV/K) \times (298 \ K) \times ln(n\_e/(6.02 \times 10^{23} \ mol^{-1}))$

To find $n\_e$, we need to calculate the intrinsic carrier density, $n\_i$:

$n\_i = \sqrt{N\_A \times N\_D} \times exp(-{E\_g/2k\_BT})$

Since $N\_D = 0$, we have:

$n\_i = \sqrt{N\_A \times 0} \times exp(-{E\_g/2k\_BT}) = 0$

However, we know that the resistivity of the semiconductor is given, so we can calculate the intrinsic carrier density using the following relation:

$\rho = \frac{1}{n\_i \mu\_n + p\_i \mu\_p}$

where $\mu\_n$ is the mobility of electrons and $\mu\_p$ is$ the mobility of holes. Substituting the given values, we get:

$3000 \ \Omega m = \frac{1}{n\_i \times 0.14 \ m^2/(V \ s) + p\_i \times 0.06 \ m^2/(V \ s)}$

$p\_i = \frac{3000 \ \Omega m \times 0.14 \ m^2/(V \ s) - n\_i \times 0.06 \ m^2/(V \ s)}{0.06 \ m^2/(V \ s)}$

Now, we can calculate the intrinsic carrier density, $n\_i$:

$n\_i = \sqrt{N\_A \times p\_i} \times exp(-{E\_g/2k\_BT})$

In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places) "," To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of light coming out of the other side of the glass panel, we need to use the reflectivity formula given by Eq.

Rmax = ⎣n2 / (1 - n0 / n2)⎤2
Rmin = ⎣n2 - n0 / (n2 + n0)⎤2

where n0 is the refractive index of the incident medium (air), n1 is the refractive index of the glass material, and n2 is the refractive index of the medium on the other side of the glass. Since we are given that the glass panel has a thickness of 5 mm and a refractive index of 1.5, we can assume that n1 = n2 = n for this problem.

First, let's find the reflectivity for the minimum absorption coefficient (α = 0.3 $cm^(-1)$):

n0 = 1
n = 1.5

Rmin = ⎣1.5 - 1 / (1.5 + 1)⎤2
Rmin = ⎣0.033⎤2
Rmin ≈ 0.011

Rmax = 11.2625
Rmax ≈ 11.26

Ratio = Rmax / Rmin
Ratio = 11.26 / 0.011

The formation of dendrites in a pure metal requires an inverse temperature gradient in the liquid adjacent to the solidification front, which means that the local liquidus temperature is depressed near the solidification front where the concentration of the solute is higher, and the liquid composition is lower and the liquidus temperature is higher far from the solidification front.

ΔG° = ΔG°f + RT ln Q

where ΔG°f is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Q is the reaction quotient.

First, we need to calculate ΔG°f for the reaction FeO + CO = Fe + CO2 at 1173 K:

ΔG°f = −RT ln K

where K is the equilibrium constant. We can calculate K using the given ΔG° value:

ΔG° = ΔG°f = −RT ln K
8120 J = −(8.314 J/mol·K) × (1173 K) × ln K

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for K:

ln K = −(8120 J / (8.314 J/mol·K × 1173 K)) = −11.13
K = e^(-11.13) = 0.00031

Now, we can calculate the reaction quotient Q at the given conditions (p(CO) = m and p(CO2) = 1.5 − m):

Q = aFeO·pFeO·pCO / aFe·pFe·pCO2

Since aFe and aFeO are both equal to 1 for pure Fe and FeO, respectively:

Q = pCO / pCO2

Substituting the given values:

Q = m / (1.5 − m)

To find the value of m that satisfies the given condition (Q = p(CO)/p(CO2) = 2.3), we can set up the equation:

m / (1.5 − m) = 2.3

Solving for m:

m = 0.6
p(CO) = 0.6 atm
p(CO2) = 1.5 − 0.6 = 0.9 atm

Therefore, the ratio of p(CO)/p(CO2) is 0.6/0.9 = 0.67.

$ΔH^{mix}$ = -19,250 * $χ_{Cu}$ * $χ_{Zn}$

To find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we need to differentiate the above equation with respect to $χ_{Cu}$ while keeping $T$ and $P$ constant.

Using the given equation, we have:

$∂ΔH^{mix}∂χ_{Cu}$ = -19,250 * $∂(χ_{Cu}χ_{Zn})∂χ_{Cu}$

Since $χ_{Cu}$ and $χ_{Zn}$ are molality concentrations, their product is a function of both $χ_{Cu}$ and $χ_{Zn}$. To find the partial derivative, we can use the chain rule:

$∂(χ_{Cu}χ_{Zn})∂χ_{Cu}$ = $χ_{Zn}$ + $χ_{Cu}$ * $∂χ_{Cu}∂χ_{Cu}$

Since $∂χ_{Cu}∂χ_{Cu}$ is equal to 1, we have:

$∂(χ_{Cu}χ_{Zn})∂χ_{Cu}$ = $χ_{Zn}$ + $χ_{Cu}$

Substituting this back into the equation for the partial derivative, we get:

$∂ΔH^{mix}∂χ_{Cu}$ = -19,250 * ($χ_{Zn}$ + $χ_{Cu}$)

Now, we can find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu by integrating the above expression with respect to $χ_{Cu}$ from 0 to $χ_{Cu}$ (the molality concentration of Cu in the solution):

$ΔH^{mix}_{Cu}$ = $\int_{0}^{χ_{Cu}} ∂ΔH^{mix}∂χ_{Cu} dχ_{Cu}$

Substituting the expression for $∂ΔH^{mix}∂χ_{Cu}$ and integrating, we get:

$ΔH^{mix}_{Cu}$ = -19,250 * [$χ_{Zn}$ * $χ_{Cu}$ - $\frac{1}{2}$ * $χ_{Cu}^2$]

To simplify the expression, we can substitute $x$ = $χ_{Cu}$ and $y$ = $χ_{Zn}$:

$ΔH^{mix}_{Cu}$ = -19,250 * [$y$ * $x$ - $\frac{1}{2}$ * $x^2$]

Now, we can compare this expression with the given options:

(A) 19,250 * $(χ_{Zn})^2$ = 19,250 * $y^2$
(B) -19,250 * $(χ_{Cu})^2$ = -19,250 * $x^2$

(D) -19,250 * $(χ_{Zn})^2$ = -19,250 * $y^2$

$ΔH^{mix}_{Cu}$ = 19,250 * $(χ_{Zn})^2$ or $ΔH^{mix}_{Cu}$ = -19,250 * $(χ_{Zn})^2$

What is the activity of Q in an alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6 at the same temperature?,"To find the activity of Q in aQ in an alloy of composition xR = 0.6, we first need to find the activity coefficient γQ. We are given the equation for ln γQ in terms of xR.

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(𝑥_R)^2$ - 0.2*$(𝑥_R)^3$

Now, we can find the value of γQ by substituting xR = 0.6 into the equation:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(0.6)^2$ - 0.2*$(0.6)^3$

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.1296$ - $0.0216$

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.108$

To find the activity aQ, we can use the relationship:

aQ = $𝛾_𝑄$ * $𝜇_𝑄^\circ$

where $𝜇_𝑄^\circ$ is the standard chemical potential of Q. Since the problem does not provide the value of $𝜇_𝑄^\circ$, we cannot directly calculate the activity of Q. However, we can calculate the activity coefficient γQ and then use it to determine the activity if the standard chemical potential is known.

Therefore, the answer is: The activity coefficient of Q in an alloy of composition xR = 0.6 at the given temperature is γQ = e^(0.108) = 1.122.

Assume that air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen.,"To find the theoretical requirement of air for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$, we first need to determine the minimum oxygen requirement and then convert it to air volume at STP.

1. Minimum oxygen requirement:
The balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of $CH_4$ is:

$CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O$

From this equation, we can see that for every mole of $CH_4$, we need 2 moles of $O_2$.

2. Minimum oxygen requirement in kg:
First, let's find the minimum oxygen requirement in kg for 100 $m^3$ of $CH_4$ (at STP). We know that 1 $m^3$ of $CH_4$ (at STP) has a mass of approximately 0.66 kg. So, 100 $m^3. Minimum oxygen requirement in moles:

The minimum oxygen requirement in moles is:

$100 \text{ m}^3 \times \frac{0.66 \text{ kg}}{1 \text{ m}^3} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol CH}_4}{0.66 \text{ kg CH}_4} \times \frac{2 \text{ mol O}_2}{1 \text{ mol CH}_4} = 111.7 \text{ mol O}_2$

4. Minimum oxygen requirement in kg:

The minimum oxygen requirement in kg is:

$111.7 \text{ mol O}_2 \times \frac{32.0 \text{ kg}}{1 \text{ mol}} = 3631.2 \text{ kg}$

5. Minimum air requirement in kg:

We know that dry air contains 23.2% oxygen by mass. So, the minimum air requirement in kg is:

$3631.2 \text{ kg} \div 0.232 = 15,631.5 \text{ kg}$

6. Minimum air requirement in $m^3$ (at STP):

The molar mass of dry air is approximately 28.97 g/mol. So, the minimum air requirement in $m^3$ (at STP) is:

$15,631.5 \text{ kg} \div 28.97 \text{ g/mol} \approx 539.8 \text{ m}^3$

So, the theoretical requirement of air (in $m^3$ at STP) for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$ is approximately 539.8 $m^3$.",,,0,

Given $∆𝐻°_(298)$ = 172000 joules per mole of $CO_2$, which of the following conditions will favour the forward reaction?  (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure. (B) Decreasing temperature and increasing pressure. (C) Decreasing both temperature and pressure. (D) Increasing temperature and decreasing pressure.","The correct answer is (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure.

Explanation:
The Boudouard reaction, C(s) + $CO_2$ (g) ⇋ 2CO(g), is an important reaction in iron making. The reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. The sign of the Gibbs free energy change, ∆G, determines the spontaneity of the reaction. For the forward reaction to be favored, ∆G should be negative.

The standard Gibbs free energy change, ∆G°, for the reaction is given as 172000 joules per mole of $CO_2$. To determine the conditions that will favor the forward reaction, we need to consider how temperature and pressure affect ∆G.

The relationship between temperature, pressure, and ∆G is given by the following equation:

∆G = ∆G° + RT ln(Q)

where ∆G° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Q is the reaction quotient.

The reaction quotient, Q, is the ratio of the reaction is:

Q = [CO]^2 / [C(s)] * [$CO_2$]

Since the reaction is exothermic, decreasing the temperature will make the reaction less favorable, as it will make the reaction less spontaneous. However, increasing the pressure can make the reaction more favorable by increasing the partial pressure of CO and decreasing the partial pressure of $CO_2$, which will shift the equilibrium towards the forward reaction.

Therefore, the conditions that will favor the forward reaction are increasing both temperature and pressure.",,,0,

To find the value of $X\_A$ at which $∆S_(mix)$ is maximum, we need to find the value of $X\_A$ that maximizes the function $f(X\_A)$ = -$X\_A*ln(X\_A)$ - $X\_B*ln(X\_B)$ with the constraint $X\_A + X\_B = 1$.

This is a Legendre problem, and the solution is obtained by finding the value of $X\_A$ that maximizes the Lagrangian $L(X\_A, λ)$ = $f(X\_A) - λ(X\_A + X\_B - 1)$.

Setting the derivative of $L$ with respect to $X\_A$ equal to zero, we have:

$-ln(X\_A) - 1 - λ = 0$

Solving for $X\_A$, we get:

$X\_A = e^{-(1 + λ)}$

Since $X\_A + X\_B = 1$, we have $X\_B = 1 - X\_A = 1 - e^{-(1 + λ)}$.

Substituting $X\_B$ into the expression for $∆S_(mix)$, we get:

$∆S_(mix)$ = -R*[ $X\_A*ln(X\_A) + X\_B*ln(X\_B)$ ]
= -R*[ $X\_A*ln(X\_A) + (1 - X\_A)*ln(1 - X\_A)$ ]

To find the maximum value of $∆S_(mix)$, we need to find the value of $λ$ that maximizes this function.

Setting the derivative of $∆S_(mix)$ with respect to $λ$ equal to zero, we have:

$-R*[ (1 - X\_A)*(1 + ln(1 - X\_A)) + X\_A*(-1 - ln(X\_A)) ] = 0$

Solving for $X\_A$, we get:

$X\_A = \frac{1}{2}$

Therefore, the maximum configurational entropy due to ideal mixing in a binary A-B system occurs when the mole fraction of A is $X\_A = \frac{1}{2}$ (or $X\_B = \frac{1}{2}$).",,,0,

Based on mole balance, the relationship applicable to the system at equilibrium is  (A)	$p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$ (B) $p_(Zn)$ = 2*$p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (C) $p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (D) $p_(Zn)$ = 0.5*$p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$"," Based on the given context, the correct answer is (B) $p_{Zn}$ = 2*$p_{CO}$ + $p_{CO_2}$.

Explanation:

The problem states that ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g) and 2CO(g) = $CO_2$(g) are at thermodynamic equilibrium in a closed reactor. This means that the reactants and products are in equilibrium with each other, and their concentrations are determined by the equilibrium constant.

At equilibrium, the number of moles of reactants and products must be equal. Let's denote the number of moles of Zn(g) as nZn, the number of moles of CO(g) as nCO, and the number of moles of $CO_2$(g) as n$CO_2$.

From the first reaction, we have:

nZn + nCO = nZn(s) + nZnO

Since ZnO(s) and Zn(s) are solids and do not contribute to the gas phase, we have:

nZn = nCO

From the second reaction, we have:

2nCO = n$CO_2$

Substituting nCO = nZn from the first reaction, we get:

2nZn = n$CO_2$

Therefore, the ratio of the partial pressures of Zn and CO2 at equilibrium is given by:

$\frac{p_{Zn}}{p_{CO_2}} = \frac{nZn}{n_{CO_2}} = \frac{1}{2}$

Since the gases are ideal, we have:

$p_{Zn}$ = $nZn$ * $R$ * $T$ / $V$

$p_{CO_2}$ = $n_{CO_2}$ * $R$ * $T$ / $V$

Substituting the ratio we found above, we get:

$p_{Zn}$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ * $p_{CO_2}$

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

$p_{Zn}$ = 2 * $p_{CO_2}$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $p_{Zn}$ = 2*$p_{CO}$ + $p_{CO_2}$.",,,0,

$γ_{SiC-SiC} = γ_{SiC-Ni} + 2\gamma_{SiC-SiC}^{neck}$

where $\gamma_{SiC-SiC}^{neck}$ is the interparticle neck size.

First, we need to find the difference between the solid-solid and solid-liquid interfacial energies:

$\Delta\gamma = \gamma_{SiC-SiC} - \gamma_{SiC-Ni} = 0.80\ J.m^{-2} - 0.45\ J.m^{-2} = 0.35\ J.m^{-2}$

Next, we can use the following equation to find the neck size:

$\Delta\gamma = \frac{4\gamma_{SiC-SiC}^{neck}\cdot\cos(\theta)}{d}$

where $\theta$ is the contact angle between SiC and Ni, and $d$ is the grain size.

Since the contact angle is not given in the problem, we cannot directly calculate the neck size. However, we can make an approximation by assuming a typical contact angle value for SiC and Ni, such as $60^\circ$.

Using this approximation, we can calculate the neck size:

$\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{1+\frac{d}{2\gamma_{SiC-SiC}^{neck}}}-1)$

$\cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{1+\frac{20\mu m}{2\cdot0.35\ J.m^{-2}\cdot\gamma_{SiC-SiC}^{neck}}}-1)$

Solving for $\gamma_{SiC-SiC}^{neck}$, we get:

$\gamma_{SiC-SiC}^{neck} = \frac{d}{2\cdot\cos^2(60^\circ)-2\cdot\frac{d}{2\cdot\Delta\gamma}} = \frac{20\mu m}{2\cdot\cos^2(60^\circ)-2\cdot\frac{20\mu m}{2\cdot0.35\ J.m^{-2}\cdot0.80\ J.m^{-2}}} \approx 1.95\mu m$

Therefore, the average interparticle neck size is approximately $1.95\mu m$.

First, let's calculate the heat released during the reaction:

ΔH°_(298) (CO + O₂ → CO₂) = -282000 kJ/(kg-mol CO)

Since the stoichiometric ratio for CO and O₂ is 1:1, the molar flow rate of oxygen entering the reactor is also 1 kg-mol.h⁻¹.

The reaction produces one mole of CO₂ for each mole of CO, so the molar flow rate of CO₂CO₂ leaving the reactor is also 1 kg-mol.h⁻¹.

The heat released during the reaction is equal to the heat flow into the system, so we can use the first law of thermodynamics to find the temperature increase:

To convert the units, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 1000:

ΔT = (-282000 kJ) / (1 kg-mol * 44 kJ/(kg-mol * K))

ΔT = -64047.05 K

Since the temperature cannot be negative, we have made an error. The temperature increase should be positive. Let's check our calculations:

We can then use the given entropy changes to find the entropy change for the transformation at 368.5 K.

From the text, we have:

ΔS I (monoclinic sulfur path) = 37.8 ± 0.4 J/K mol
ΔS II (rhombic sulfur path) = 36.86 J/K mol

Let's assume that the entropy of both forms of sulfur at 0 K is zero for simplicity. Then, we can use the given entropy changes to find the absolute entropy values at 368.5 K:

S368.5(monoclinic) = 37.8 J/K mol + S0(rhombic)
S368.5(rhombic) = 36.86 J/K mol + S0(monoclinic)

Since the transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur is reversible at 368.5 K, the entropy change for the transformation is given by the difference in the absolute entropy values:

ΔS tran = S368.5(monoclinic) - S368.5(rhombic)

Substituting the given values, we have:

ΔS tran = (37.8 J/K mol + S0(rhombic)) - (36.86 J/K mol + S0(monoclinic))

To find S0(rhombic) and S0(monoclinic), we can use the equation for the entropy change of a substance during a constant-volume heating process:

ΔS = ΔH/T

where ΔH is the heat of transformation and T is the temperature. We can use the given entropy changes to find ΔH:

ΔH = ΔS I + ΔS II = 37.8 J/K mol - 36.86 J/K mol = 0.94 J/K mol

Now, we can use the given temperature (368.5 K) and the heat of transformation to find the absolute entropy values:

S0(monoclinic) = S368.5(monoclinic) - ΔS tran
S0(rhombic) = S368.5(rhombic) - ΔS tran

Substituting the given value of ΔS tran = 37.9 J/K mol (calculated earlier), we have:

S0(monoclinic) = 37.9 J/K mol - ΔS tran = 37.9 J/K mol - 37.9 J/K mol = 0 J/K mol
S0(rhombic) = 36.86 J/K mol + ΔS tran = 36.86 J/K mol + 37.9 J/K mol = 74.76 J/K mol

Therefore, the entropy change for the transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5 K is:

ΔS tran = S368.5(monoclinic) - S368.5(rhombic) = 37.9 J/K mol - (36.86 J/K mol + 74.76 J/K mol) = -30.0 J/K mol

However, the given entropy change for the transformation was 36.86 J/K mol, which is incorrect. The correct value should be the negative of the given value, i.e., -36.86 J/K mol. Therefore, the absolute entropy value of monoclinic sulfur at 368.5 K is:

Now, we can calculate the time, t, required for neck growth using the following equation (Garner et al., 2009):

t = (d^2 * ρ * D / (3 * σ))

The diffusivity, D, can be estimated using the following equation (Garner et al., 2009):

D = D0 * exp(-Q / (RT))

where:
- D0 is the diffusivity at a reference temperature
- Q is the activation energy
- R is the gas constant
- T is the temperature

We don't have the values for D0, Q, and T, so we cannot directly calculate the diffusivity. However, we can make an approximation based on the fact that the sintering temperature is between the melting points of tungsten and nickel (1500°C), and the grain size is relatively large (40 µm).

Based on the information provided in the context, we know that coarse-grained materials often exhibit lower steady-state creep rates and higher creep resistances than fine-grained materials at temperatures greater than about half of the homologous temperature. Therefore, we can assume that the diffusivity at the sintering temperature is lower than at room temperature.

Furthermore, we can make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the time based on the given grain size and interfacial energy. The neck size equation shows that the neck size is proportional to the cube root of time. Therefore, a larger grain size would result in a larger neck size, assuming all other factors are equal.

Based on these assumptions, we can estimate the time as follows:

t = (40 µm^2 * 19.3 g.cm^(-3) * D / (3 * 0.011 N.m^(-2)))

Assuming D is an order of magnitude smaller than at room temperature, we can estimate D as 10^(-13) m^2.s^(-1).

t = (40 µm^2 * 19.3 g.cm^(-3) * 10^(-13) m^2.s^(-1) / (3 * 0.011 N.m^(-2)))
t = 1.3 * 10^11 s

Now, we can calculate the average neck size using the neck size equation:

dneck = (3 * 0.011 N.m^(-2) * 1.3 * 10^11 s / (2 * 19.3 g.cm^(-3) * 10^(-13) m^2.s^(-1)))^(1/3)
dneck = 22.5 µm

Therefore, the predicted average neck size of sintered tungsten grains is approximately 22.5 µm.

Based on the given options, the closest answer is (C) 20 µm. However, it's important to note that our estimate is",,,0,

The molar free energy of the ideal solution is given by:

ΔGid = x*(G\_B)^(0,L) + (1-x)*(G\_A)^(0,L)

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔGid = x*(G\_B)^(0,L) + (1-x)*(G\_A)^(0,L)
= x*(G\_B)^(0,L) + (1-x)*(G\_A)^(0,L)
= 0.5*(G\_B)^(0,L) + 0.5*(G\_A)^(0,L)

To find the molar free energy of the real solution, we need to use the given equation for the molar free energy of the liquid solution and substitute the values:

ΔGreal = (1-x)*[G\_A]^(0,L) + x*[G\_B]^(0,L) + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x)

Substituting x = 0.5 and T = 1000 K, we get:

ΔGreal = (1-0.5)*[G\_A]^(0,L) + 0.5*[G\_B]^(0,L) + RT[0.5ln0.5 + 0.5ln0.5] + 4000(0.5)(1-0.5)
= (1-0.5)*[G\_A]^(0,L) + 0.5*[G\_B]^(0,L) + RT[-0.1863] + 1000

Now, we can find the excess molar free energy by subtracting the molar free energy of the ideal solution from the molar free energy of the real solution:

ΔGXS = ΔGreal - ΔGid
= [G\_A]^(0,L) - [G\_B]^(0,L) + RT[-0.1863] + 1000 - [G\_B]^(0,L) - [G\_A]^(0,L)
= RT[-0.1863] + 1000

Now, we need to find the value of RT at T = 1000 K:

RT = 8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ * 1000 K = 8314 J $mol^(-1)$

Substituting this value, we get:

ΔGXS = RT[-0.1863] + 1000

(3.63) in the text, which includes the interfacial energy between the solid nucleus and the surrounding, supercooled liquid (γSL). Since the solid-liquid interfacial energy increases by 10%, the interfacial energy term in Eq. (3.63) will also increase by 10%.

Therefore, the energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation will also increase by 10%. However, the answer choices do not reflect this. Let's calculate the percentage change in the energy barrier based on the given information:

The energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation is given by Eq. (3.63) in the text: ΔGt = 3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2γSL

Let's denote the initial interfacial energy by γSL0 and the final interfacial energy by γSL1, which is 10% greater than the initial interfacial energy: γSL1 = γSL0 + 0.1γSL0

The percentage change in the energy barrier is given by:

Δ(ΔGt) / ΔGt = (ΔGt1 - ΔGt0) / ΔGt

where ΔGt0 is the initial energy barrier and ΔGt1 is the final energy barrier.

Substituting the expressions for ΔGt0 and ΔGt1 into the above equation, we get:

Δ(ΔGt) / ΔGt = [(3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL1) - (3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0))) / (3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0))]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Δ(ΔGt) / ΔGt = [(3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL1)) / (3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0))] - 1

Since γSL1 = γSL0 + 0.1γSL0, we can write:

Δ(ΔGt) / ΔGt = [(3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0 + 1.1γSL0)) / (3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0))] - 1

Simplifying this expression further, we get:

Δ(ΔGt) / ΔGt = [(3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0 + 1.1γSL0)) / (3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0))] - [(3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0)) / (3πr3ΔGv - 4πr2(γSL0))]

Given: ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * $(1 - x_{Zn})^2$

We can find $x_{Cd}$ = 1 - $x_{Zn}$ = 0.3.

Now, we can calculate the activity of Zn in the alloy using Raoult's law:

$a_{Zn}$ = $x_{Zn}$ * $\gamma_{Zn}$ = $x_{Zn}$ * $e^{ln(\gamma_{Zn})}$

Substituting the values:

$a_{Zn}$ = 0.7 * $e^{0.875 * (1 - 0.7)^2}$ = 0.7 * $e^{0.875 * 0.09}$ = 0.7 * $e^{0.07865}$ = 0.7 * 1.0113

$a_{Zn}$ ≈ 0.7113

$p_{Zn}(x_{Zn})$ = $a_{Zn}$ * $p_{Zn}^{0}$ = 0.7113 * 3.6 * $10^{-4}$ atm ≈ 2.56 * $10^{-4}$ atm

Now, we can find the ratio of the vapor pressures:

${\frac{p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=0.7)}{p_{Zn}(x_{Zn}=1.0)}}$ = ${\frac{2.56 * 10^{-4}}{3.6 * 10^{-4}}}$ ≈ 0.7111

Explanation:

When excess oxygen is used in the combustion of $C_(3)H_(8)$, it results in the formation of excess $N_(2)$ in the products. This excess $N_(2)$ acts as a heat sink, reducing the temperature of the products. Therefore, the adiabatic flame temperature will be lower than 5975K with a small excess of oxygen, but it may be higher than 5975K with a large excess of oxygen due to the endothermic nature of the nitrogen dissociation reaction that occurs in the flame.

(C) 4 hours. (D) 16 hours. ","To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the heat transfer rate is proportional to the temperature difference and the thermal conductivity. We can also assume that the spheres are initially at the furnace temperature and that the heat transfer is one-dimensional (radial).

First, let's find the heat transfer rate from the furnace to the spheres. The heat transfer rate per unit area is given by the heat transfer coefficient (k) times the temperature difference between the furnace and the sphere surface. We can call this heat transfer rate q.

Next, we can use the heat equation to find the temperature distribution within each sphere. The heat equation is given by:

ρC∂tT = ∂r(k∂rT∂r) + Q

where ρ is the density, C is the specific heat capacity, t is time, T is temperature, k is thermal conductivity, and Q is the heat generation rate (which is zero in this case).

We can assume that the temperature at the surface of each sphere is the same (since they are in the same furnace), so we can set the boundary conditions as:

T(r=R) = Tf (where R is the sphere radius and Tf is the furnace temperature)

We can also assume that there is no heat generation within the spheres, so the heat equation simplifies to:

∂r(k∂rT) = -q/4πR²

We can solve this equation using separation of variables and the method of integrating factors. The solution will depend on the thermal diffusivity (k/ρC) and the heat transfer rate q.

Now, we can use the fact that the center of sphere X reaches 800K in 1 hour to find the heat transfer rate qx. We can call the temperature at the center of sphere X To and the temperature at the surface of sphere X Ts. We have:

To = 800K
Ts = Tf = 1000K
t = 1 hour

Using the heat equation and the boundary conditions, we can find:

qx = -(4πR²k)∂T/∂r(R) = -(4πR²k)(To - Ts)/t

Now, we can use the same method to find the temperature distribution in sphere Y and the heat transfer rate qy when the center of sphere Y reaches 800K. The temperature at the center of sphere Y will be called To' and the temperature at the surface of sphere Y will be Ts' (which is the same as Ts since they are in the same furnace). We have:

To' = 800K
t' = time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K

Using the same method as before, we can find:

qy = -(4πR²k)(To' - Ts')/t'

Now, we can use the fact that the heat transfer rate is proportional to the temperature difference to find the ratio of the heat transfer rates:

qx/qy = (To - Ts)/(To' - Ts)

Substituting the values we know, we get:

qx/qy = (800 - 1000)/(800 - To')

Since To' > 800, this ratio is negative, which means that sphere Y is transferring more heat to the environment than it is receiving from the furnace, which is not possible. This means that the lumped capacitance approach cannot be used in this case, and we cannot directly compare the times required for the centers of the spheres to reach 800K.

First, let's find the compositions of the two phases at the eutectic temperature (561°C) for the given alloy (50 wt.% Sn).

From the phase diagram, we have:

At 561°C: L(36.9 wt.% Sn) → α(14.48 wt.% Sn) + $Mg_2Sn$

Using the given atomic weights, we can calculate the mole fractions of Sn and Mg in the liquid phase (L) and the α-phase at the eutectic temperature.

Mole fraction of Sn in L = 36.9 g Sn / (36.9 g Sn + 63.1 g Mg) = 0.373
Mole fraction of Mg in L = 1 - 0.373 = 0.627

Mole fraction of Sn in α-phase = 14.48 wt.% Sn / (100 wt.% - 14.48 wt.% Sn) = 0.125
Mole fraction of Mg in α-phase = 1 - 0.125 = 0.875

Now, we can use the lever rule to find the mole fractions of Sn and Mg in the solid solution (α-phase) and the eutectic constituent (Mg) in the final alloy.

Mole fraction of Sn in α-phase = (Mole fraction of Sn in L) / (1 + (Mole fraction of Sn in L) / (Mole fraction of Sn in $Mg_2Sn$))

Mole fraction of Sn in $Mg_2Sn$ = 14.48 wt.% Sn / (100 wt.% - 14.48 wt wt.% Sn) = 0.125

Mole fraction of Sn in α-phase = 0.373 / (1 + 0.373 / 0.125) = 0.215

Mole fraction of Mg in α-phase = 1 - 0.215 = 0.785

Mole fraction of Mg in the final alloy = 0.627

To find the weight percentage of Mg in the final alloy, we can use the following formula:

Weight % Mg = (Mole fraction of Mg in the final alloy) × (Molecular weight of Mg) / (Molecular weight of Mg + Molecular weight of Sn)

Weight % Mg = 0.785 × (24.3 g/mol) / (24.3 g/mol + 118.7 g/mol) = 0.183

The reason [r] is also true as during creep deformation, particles with higher misfit with the matrix can lose coherency. Carbide particles, which have a higher misfit with the matrix, are more likely to lose coherency and precipitate out of the matrix, leading to an increase in the number of particles that can prevent grain-boundary sliding and migration. This is the mechanism by which the addition of strong carbide-forming elements improves creep resistance in low alloy steels.",,,0,

The context states that for ideal solutions, the enthalpy of mixing is zero, and the activity coefficients are equal to the mole fractions. Therefore, if the enthalpy of mixing is zero, then the activity of component B, $a\_B$, must be greater than its mole fraction, $X\_B$, since the activity is defined as the product of the mole fraction and the activity coefficient, and the activity coefficient is greater than or equal to one for ideal solutions.",,,0,

For a given undercooling, if surface energy of a nucleus increases by 20%, the corresponding increase(in percent) in the critical radius of the nucleus is?(round off to nearest integer)"," To find the percentage increase in the critical radius of a spherical nucleus for a given percentage increase in surface energy, we can use the equations provided in the context.

First, let's find the relationship between the surface energy and the critical radius using Equation 2-44:

AG* = 16Jr³ (3AGv - AT)

We are given that the surface energy (AGs) increases by 20%. Let's denote the initial surface energy as AGs0 and the final surface energy as AGs1:

AGs1 = AGs0 + 0.2 * AGs0

Now, we want to find the percentage increase in the critical radius (r*) for this change in surface energy. To do this, we can set the initial and final free energies equal to each other and solve for the ratio of the final to initial critical radii:

16Jr⁴³ (3AGv - AT) = 16J(r⁺)⁴³ (3AGv - AT + ΔAGs)

where ΔAGs = AGs1 - AGs0.

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 16Jr⁴³ (3AGv - AT)³:

(r⁺)³ / r³ = (1 + ΔAGs / (3AGv - AT))³

Now, we can find the percentage increase in the critical radius by taking the third root of both sides and subtracting 1:

% increase in r* = ( (r⁺)³ / r³ )¹³ - 1

To find the numerical value, we need to know the values of AGv, AT, and AGs0. However, we can find the percentage increase in r* in terms of AGs0 and the percentage increase in AGs:

% increase in r* = ( (1 + ΔAGs / AGs₀)³ - 1)

Since ΔAGs / AGs₀ = 0.2, we can substitute this value and simplify:

% increase in r* = ( (1 + 0.2)³ - 1) ≈ 24.37%

Therefore, the answer is approximately 24.4%. However, since we are asked to round off to the nearest integer, the answer is 25%.

Explanation:

The given reacting system has two independent reactions:

1. M(s) + CO2(g) = MO(s)
2. CO2(g) = CO(g) + 1/2 O2(g)

The number of components in the system is 3 (M, CO, and O).

Using the phase rule equation (DF = (C - 1)π + 2 - (C(π - 1) + NIR)), where C is the number of components, π is the number of phases, and NIR is the number of independent reactions, we have:

DF = (3 - 1)π + 2 - (3(π - 1) + 2)

Since there are two phases (solid and gas), π = 2.

DF = 2π + 2 - 3π + 2
DF = 2 + 2 - 3 + 2
DF = 2

The weight gain (mg $cm^2$) after a duration of 1600s is?(round off to nearest integer). ,"To find the weight gain after a duration of 1600 seconds, we can use the given relationship between weight gain and time:

Weight gain (mg $cm^2$) ∝ √(Time (s))

First, we need to find the weight gain per second squared (mg $cm^2$/s^2) from the given data:

Weight gain per second squared = (Weight gain (mg $cm^2$)) / (Time (s))^(1/2)
                                            = 2 mg $cm^2$ / (400 s)^(1/2)
                                            = 2 mg $cm^2$ / 20 s^(1/2)
                                            = 2 mg $cm^2$ / √(20 s)
                                            = 2 mg $cm^2$ / 4.472 s^(1/2)
                                            ≈ 0.443 mg $cm^2$/s^2

Now, we can find the weight gain after 1600 seconds:

Weight gain (mg $cm^2$) = Weight gain per second squared × Time (s)
                                     = 0.443 mg $cm^2$/s^2 × 1600 s

What is the change in the enthalpy of pure iron (in J/mol) when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C?," To find the change in enthalpy of pure iron when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C, we first need to find the molar heat capacity at constant pressure ($C_p$) as a function of temperature T (in K). The given equation is:

$C_p$ = 17.49 + 24.77 * $10^(-3)*T$

We can rewrite this equation in the form of a polynomial:

$C_p$ = a + b*T

where a = 17.49 J/(mol.K) and b = 24.77 * $10^(-3)$ J/(mol.K.K)

Now, we can use the equation for the change in enthalpy (Eq. (2.52) in the context):

$\Delta H = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} C_p dT$

Substituting the given temperature range and the expression for $C_p$:

$\Delta H = \int_{298.15}^{973.15} (17.49 + 24.77 * 10^(-3)*T) dT$

Integrating term by term:

$\Delta H = \int_{298.15}^{973.15} 17.49 dT + \int_{298.15}^{973.15} 24.77 * 10^(-3)*T dT$

$\Delta H = 17.49*(T_2 - T_1) + \frac{24.77 * 10^(-3)}{2}*(T_2^2 - T_1^2)$

Substituting the given temperature range:

$\Delta H = 17.49*(700 - 25) + \frac{24.77 * 10^(-3)}{2}*(700^2 - 298.15^2)$

$\Delta H = 17.49*675 + \frac{24.77 * 10^(-3)}{2}*(492222.25 - 87612.25)$

$\Delta H = 1231.25\text{ J/mol} + 11961.3\text{ J/mol$

The equilibrium ratio, $𝑝_(C0_2)$/ $𝑝_(CO)$ for the reaction at 1200 K and 1 atm is ?","To find the equilibrium ratio of CO2/CO for the given reaction at 1200 K and 1 atm, we can use the equation:

ln(Kp) = ΔG°/RT

where Kp is the equilibrium constant, ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

First, we need to calculate the value of Kp using the given ΔG°:

ΔG° = −8000 J/mol
R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$
T = 1200 K

ln(Kp) = ΔG°/RT
ln(Kp) = (-8000 J/mol) / (8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$ × 1200 K)
ln(Kp) ≈ -3.11

Now, we can use the equation for the equilibrium constant of a reaction between a gas and a solid:

Kp = (pCO2) / (pCO) ^ γ

where pCO and pCO2 are the partial pressures of CO and CO2, respectively, and γ is the stoichiometric coefficient of CO2 in the reaction. In this case, γ = 1.

Since we know that the total pressure is 1 atm and the partial pressure of CO is given as 1 atm - pCO2, we can write:

pCO = 1 atm - pCO2

Substituting these values into the equation for Kp, we get:

Kp = (pCO2) / (1 atm - pCO2)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have:

ln(Kp) = ln(pCO2) - ln(1 atm - pCO2)

Using the value of ln(Kp) that we calculated earlier, we can find the value of pCO2:

ln(Kp) = -3.11
ln(pCO2) - ln(1 atm - pCO2) = -3.11

To solve for pCO2, we can use the following steps:

1. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
ln(pCO2) = ln(Kp) + ln(1 atm - pCO2)

2. Use the value of ln(Kp) that we calculated earlier:
ln(pCO2) = (-3.11) + ln(1 atm - pCO2)

3. Use the property of logarithms to separate the terms:
ln(pCO2) = -3.11 + ln(1 atm) - ln(1 - CO2/CO)

4. Use the fact that ln(1 atm) = 0:
ln(pCO2) = -3.11 - ln(1 - CO2/CO)

5. Use the fact that the natural logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is negative:
pCO2 = e^(-3.11 - ln(1 - CO2/CO))
pCO2 = e^(-3.11) × e^(ln(1 - CO2/CO))
pCO2 = 0.048 × (1 - CO2/CO)

6. Solve for CO2/CO:
CO2/CO = (1 - pCO2/pCO)
CO2/CO = (1 - 0.048 × (1 - CO2/CO))
CO2/CO = 0.048 + 0.048 × CO2/CO
CO2/CO = 0.096 / (1 - 0.048)
CO2/CO ≈ 0.215

We are given the latent heat of fusion, $∆H^(L→S) = -1000 J mol^(-1)$, and the temperature difference, $\Delta T = 1356 K - 1200 K = 156 K$.

First, we need to find the change in entropy, $∆S^(L→S)$. We can use the given equation 2.19:

$∆S^(L→S) = \Delta H^(L→S) / T_m$

$∆G^(L→S) = -1000 J mol^(-1) - (1200 K)(-0.733 J/(mol K))$

$∆G^(L→S) = -1000 J mol^(-1) + 880 J mol^(-1) = -1120 J mol^(-1)$

Given:
- The latent heat of fusion is 3 × 10^(5) J/kg
- The total rate of heat removal by the mould is 4.2 × 10^6 W
- The metal exits the mould at a rate of 35 kg/s

We assume that the metal remains at the melting point while in the mould, so the heat removed by the mould is equal to the latent heat of fusion of the solidified metal.

Heat balance: 4.2 × 10^6 W = 35 kg/s × 3 × 10^(5) J/kg = 1.05 × 10^12 J/s

Now, we need to find the volume flow rate of solidified metal and the volume fraction of solid at the mould exit.

First, we find the volume flow rate of solidified metal:

Volume flow rate of solidified metal = Mass flow rate of solidified metal / Density of solidified metal

The density of solidified metal is the same as the density of the liquid metal since they are at the melting point. Let's assume the density of the metal is 7850 kg/m^3.

Volume flow rate of solidified metal = 35 kg/s / 7850 kg/m^3 = 4.56 × 10^-3 m^3/s

Next, we find the volume fraction of solid at the mould exit:

Volume fraction of solid = Volume of solid / (Volume of solid + Volume of liquid)

Since the metal exits the mould as a shell with a liquid core, we can assume that the volume of the solidified shell is equal to the cross-sectional area of the shell times the length of the shell. Let's assume the cross-sectional area of the shell is A and the length of the shell is L.

Volume of solid = AL

Volume of liquid = (Mass of liquid / Density of liquid) = (Mass of liquid / 7850 kg/m^3)

Mass of liquid = Mass flow rate of liquid metal × Time = 35 kg/s × t

Assuming the length of the shell is constant, we can find the time it takes for the shell to exit the mould by dividing the volume of the shell by the volume flow rate of solidified metal:

t = AL / (4.56 × 10^-3 m^3/s)

Now, we can find the volume fraction of solid:

Volume fraction of solid = AL / (AL + (35 kg/s × t / 7850 kg/m^3))

Substituting the given values, we get:

Volume fraction of solid = AL / (AL + (35 kg/s × t / 7850 kg/m^3))

Without knowing the values of A and L, we cannot find the exact value of the volume fraction of solid. However, we can express the answer as:

Answer: The mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is (AL / (AL + (35 kg/s × t / 7850 kg/m^3))).

First, we need to calculate the activity of Si at 1 wt.% using the activity coefficient at infinite dilution:

aSi (1 wt.%) = $10^{-3}$ (activity coefficient at infinite dilution) * $1$ (activity at 1 molal concentration, which is equivalent to 1 wt.% for a binary solution)

Since the total Gibbs energy of the solution is independent of the choice of the standard state, we can use the standard state of pure liquid Si as a reference. The activity of Si in the pure liquid state is equal to 1.
(aSi (pure liquid) = 1).

Using the given equation for the relationship between activities in terms of activities at different standard states and the activity coefficients, we can write:

ln(aSi (1 wt.%) / aSi (pure liquid)) = ln(aSi (1 wt.%) / 1) = ln(1 + κ)

where κ is the activity coefficient for Si at 1 wt.% in Fe. Since κ is very small, we can use the approximation ln(1 + κ) ≈ κ.

ln(aSi (1 wt.%)) = ln(1 + $10^{-3}$) ≈ $-3$

aSi (1 wt.%) ≈ $10^{-3}$

Now, we can use the equation for the Gibbs free energy change in terms of activities and the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction of Si dissolving in Fe:

ΔG° = -RT ln(aSi (1 wt.%) / aFe (pure liquid))

Since the activity of Fe in the pure liquid state is equal to 1, we have:

ΔG° ≈ -(8.314 J/mol·K)(298.15 K)(-3)

ΔG° ≈ 2.47 × 10^3 J/mol

First, let's find the fugacity of nitrogen gas at the initial and final pressures using the equation for fugacity (Equation 9.35):

Fugacity of nitrogen gas at 1 mbar:
f1 = P1 * ln(1 + (K * (P1 / RT))), where K is the ideal gas constant and R is the gas constant.

Fugacity of nitrogen gas at 0.7 mbar:
f2 = P2 * ln(1 + (K * (P2 / RT))).

x1 * P1 = x2 * P2
x1 * 1 mbar = x2 * 0.7 mbar

Now, we can use the equation for fugacity to find x2:

ln(x1 * 1 mbar / (1 - x1)) = ln(x2 * 0.7 mbar / (1 - x2))

Using the initial nitrogen content (x1 = 14 ppm), we can find the new equilibrium nitrogen content (x2):

ln(14 ppm * 1 mbar / (1 - 14 ppm)) = ln(x2 * 0.7 mbar / (1 - x2))

First, let's calculate the heat loss by convection:

q\_conv = h \* A \* (T\_slab - T\_ambient)

where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area of the slab, and T\_slab and T\_ambient are the temperatures of the slab and the ambient air, respectively.

A = l \* w \* h = 1 \* 1 \* 0.1 = 0.1 m²

q\_conv = 4.6 \* 0.1 \* (1298 - 298) = 411.28 W

Next, let's calculate the heat loss by radiation:

q\_rad = σ \* ε \* A \* (T\_slab^4 - T\_ambient^4)

where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, ε is the emissivity of the steel, and T\_slab and T\_ambient are the temperatures of the slab and the ambient air, respectively.

q\_rad = 5.7 \* 10^(-8) \* 0.8 \* 0.1 \* (1298^4 - 298^4) = 113.12 W

Finally, we can find the initial rate of heat loss by adding the heat loss rates due to convection and radiation:

q\_total = q\_conv + q\_rad = 411.28 + 113.12 = 524.4 W

Therefore, the initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by radiation and convection is approximately 524.4 W. Answer: 524.4.",,,0,

The melting point of the base material is 1500 K. The width(in mm to two decimal places) of the fusion zone is?,"To find the width of the fusion zone, we need to find the distance from the weld center where the temperature equals the melting point of the base material, which is 1500 K.

We can set up the equation:

1500 = 2000 * exp(−0.3*$𝑥^2$)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1500/2000) = ln(exp(1/𝑥^2$))

Using the property of logarithms:

ln(1500/2000) = -0.3*$𝑥^2$

Solving for $𝑥$:

$𝑥 = \sqrt{-\frac{ln(1500/2000)}{0.3}}$

Using a calculator, we find:

$𝑥 ≈ 5.54$ mm

So, the width of the fusion zone is approximately 11.08 mm (rounded to two decimal places).

Given: Gas constant R = 8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$"," To calculate the entropy of mixing for an ideal solid solution, we can use Equation 7.14 from the context provided:

∆mixS = -R(n1lnx1 + n2lnx2)

where n1 and n2 are the number of moles of components 1 and 2, and x1 and x2 are their respective mole fractions in the solution.

First, we need to find the mole fractions of Au and Ag in the solution. Since there are 2 moles of Au and 3 moles of Ag, the total number of moles is 5. The mole fraction of Au is therefore x1 = 2/5 = 0.4, and the mole fraction of Ag is x2 = 3/5 = 0.6.

Substituting these values into Equation 7.14, we get:

∆mixS = -R(2ln0.4 + 3ln0.6)

∆mixS = -(8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$) x (2ln0.4 + 3ln0.6)

The temperature(in K to one decimal place). above which $Ag_(2)O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm is?"," To find the temperature above which $Ag\_2O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure of 0.3 atm, we need to calculate the equilibrium constant $K\_p$ and then find the temperature at which $p_{O\_2}$ equals the equilibrium partial pressure $p^{eq}_{O\_2}$.

First, we need to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change $\Delta G^\circ$ at the given temperature using the given values of $\Delta H^\circ$ and $\Delta S^\circ$:

$$\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ$$

$$\Delta G^\circ = (-61080\ J - (-273.15\ K \times 132.22\ J\ K^{-1}\ mol^{-1})$$

$$\Delta G^\circ = -61080\ J + 6811.3\ J\ mol^{-1}$$

$$\Delta G^\circ = -60398.7\ J\ mol^{-1}$$

Next, we need to calculate the equilibrium constant $K\_p$ using the given value of $\Delta G^\circ$:

$$K\_p = e^{-\Delta G^\circ/RT}$$

$$K\_p = e^{-(-60398.7\ J\ mol^{-1}/(8.314\ J\ K^{-1}\ mol^{-1} \times T)}$$

Now, we need to find the temperature at which $p_{O\_2}$ equals the equilibrium partial pressure $p^{eq}_{O\_2}$:

$$p^{eq}_{O\_2} = K\_p \times p^2_{Ag\_2O}$$

$$p^{eq}_{O\_2} = K\_p \times (p_{Ag\_2O})^2$$

We know that $p_{Ag\_2O}$ is equal to the vapor pressure of $Ag\_2O$ at the given temperature. We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the vapor pressure of $Ag\_2O$ at a given temperature:

$$\ln(p_{vap}) = \ln(p^0_{vap}) + \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_{bp}}\right)$$

where $\Delta H_{vap}$ is the enthalpy of vaporization, $p^0_{vap}$ is the standard vapor pressure, $T$ is the temperature, and $T_{bp}$ is the boiling point.

We don't have the value of $\Delta H_{vap}$ or $p^0_{vap}$ for $Ag\_2O$, but we can assume a reasonable value for $T_{bp}$ and use it to find the vapor pressure at different temperatures. Let's assume $T_{bp}$ = 1200 K.

$$\ln(p_{vap}) = \ln(1\ atm) + \frac{-110.5\ kJ\ mol^{-1}}{8.314\ J\ K^{-1}\ mol^{-1}}\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{1200\ K}\right)$$

We can then find the vapor pressure at different temperatures and find the temperature at which it equals the equilibrium partial pressure $p^{eq}_{O\_2}$:

$$p^{eq}_{O\_2} = K\_p \times (p_{vap})^2$$

$$p^{eq}_{O\_2} = K\_p \times (p_{vap})^2$$

$$p^{eq}_{O\_2} = K\_p \times \left(10^14.7\ Pa \times \left(10^{14.7\ln(p_{vap}/Pa)}\right)^2\right)$$

We can then solve for the temperature numerically or graphically to find the temperature at which $p^{eq}_{O\_2}$ equals $p_{O\_2}$ = 0.3 atm.

The exact answer depends on the assumed value of $T_{bp}$ for $Ag\_2O$. Assuming $T_{bp}$ = 1200 K, the temperature at which $Ag\_2O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure of 0.3 atm is approximately 1050 K.

Thermodynamics,103,G-META-18-53,NUM,74,"Given: Specific heat capacity of copper (between 250 K and 500 K) is 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ . Assume that the system containing the two pieces of copper remains isolated during this process. A 1 mol piece of copper at 400 K is brought in contact with another 1 mol piece of copper at 300 K, and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. The entropy(in J $K^(-1)$ to three decimal places) change for this process is? ","To calculate the entropy change for the given process, we can use the formula for the entropy change of a perfect gas (Eq. (5.39) in the text), but since copper is not a perfect gas, we'll use the formula for the entropy change of a system of two components (Eq. (5.14) in the text).

First, we need to find the final temperature of the two pieces of copper after they have reached thermal equilibrium. We can use the formula for the conservation of energy (Eq. (4.29) in the text) to find the final temperature:

mcpln(T2/T1) = h2 - h1 / Cp

where m is the mass, cp is the specific heat capacity, T1 is the initial temperature, T2 is the final temperature, h1 is the enthalpy before the process, and h2 is the enthalpy after the process.

Since the system is isolated, there is no heat transfer to or from the surroundings, so h1 = hCp1T1 and h2 = hCp2T2. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

mcpln(T2/T1) = (Cp2T2 - Cp1T1) / Cp

We are given Cp = 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ for copper between 250 K and 500 K. We can assume that this value is constant over the temperature range of interest (400 K and 300 K). Therefore, we can calculate the entropy change using the formula:

ΔS = m(Cp ln(T2/T1))

where m is the mass of each piece of copper (1 mol), Cp is the specific heat capacity of copper, and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures, respectively.

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔS = 2(1 mol)(22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$) ln(T2/T1)

To find T2, we can use the conservation of energy equation:

mcpl(T2 - T1) = ΔH

where ΔH is the enthalpy change during the process, which is zero since the system is isolated. Solving for T2, we get:

T2 = T1 + ΔT

where ΔT is the temperature difference between the two pieces of copper after they have reached thermal equilibrium. We can use the formula for the temperature difference between two objects in thermal equilibrium:

ΔT = T2 - T1 = T1 - T2 / (1 + r)

where r is the thermal mass ratio, which is the ratio of the mass of one piece of copper to the mass of the other piece. In this case, r = 1 since both pieces have the same mass.

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔT = (T1 - T2) / (1 + 1) = (T1 - T2) / 2

Solving for T2(T1 + T2) = T1 + T2, we get:

T2 = (T1 + T1) / 2 = T1

This means that the final temperature is the average of the initial temperatures of the two pieces of copper. Substituting this value into the equation for ΔS, we get:

ΔS = 2(1 mol)(22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$) ln(T1/T1) = 0 J

Since the initial and final temperatures are the same, the entropy change is zero. However, this result is not physically meaningful since the entropy of an isolated system should always increase during a reversible process. This indicates that our assumption of constant specific heat capacity over the temperature range of interest may not be valid. A more accurate calculation would involve using the specific heat capacity as a function of temperature and integrating it over the temperature range of interest.

Therefore, the answer is:

$$C\_{CTVRpV} = \frac{C\_p}{C\_v} = \frac{T,m \cdot m/c_{45}/c_{61} /c_{61a}}{k^2}$$

First, we need to find the values of $T,m$, $m/c_{45}$, $m/c_{61}$, and $m/c_{61a}$ using the given data.

1. Molar volume: $V = 7 \cdot 10^{-6} m^3 \cdot mol^{-1}$

3. Isobaric expansivity: $\alpha = 6 \cdot 10^{-5} K^{-1}$

We can find the molar mass $M$ using the ideal gas law:

$$M = \frac{1 \cdot atm}{1 \cdot mol \cdot (8.314 J \cdot K^{-1} \cdot mol^{-1}) \cdot 273.15 K \cdot 7 \cdot 10^{-6} m^3}$$

$$M = 0.02897 kg/mol^{-1}$$

Now, we can find the values of $T,m$, $m/c_{45}$, $m/c_{61}$, and $m/c_{61a}$:

$$T,m = \frac{M}{R} = \frac{0.02897 kg/mol}{8.314 J \cdot K^{-1} \cdot mol^{-1}} = 3.48 \cdot 10^{-3} K^{-1} \cdot mol$$

$$m/c_{45} =} = \alpha /R = \frac{6 \cdot 10^{-5} K^{-1}}{8.314 J \cdot K^{-1} \cdot mol^{-1}} = 7.34 \cdot 10^{-3} K^{-1} \cdot mol$$

Assume specific heat capacity of air to be constant and equal to 1080 $J.kg^(-1).K^(-1)$ and π = 3.14. Air at 300 K is passed at a mass flow rate of 1.5 $kg.s^(-1)$ through a metallic tube of inner diameter 0.08 m. Inner wall temperature of the tube is maintained at 700 K. Temperature of the air leaving the tube is 600 K. Assuming that heat transfer occurs entirely by steady state convection, length of the tube(in metres) is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ","To find the length of the tube, we need to use the energy balance equation for steady-convective heat transfer. The energy balance equation states that the rate of heat transfer by convection is equal to the rate of heat transfer by conduction through the tube wall.

The rate of heat transfer by convection can be calculated using the given convective heat transfer coefficient (hi) and the surface area of the tube. The surface area can be calculated using the inner diameter and length of the tube.

The rate of heat transfer by conduction can be calculated using Fourier's law and the thermal conductivity of the tube material, the temperature difference between the inner and outer surfaces of the tube, and the cross-sectional area of the tube.

First, let's calculate the rate of heat transfer by convection:

q_conv = hi * A

where A is the surface area of the tube.

A = π * (diameter/2)^2 * length

Substituting the given values:

A = π * (0.08 m)^2 * x

where x is the length of the tube.

q_conv = 500 W.m^-2.K^-1 * π * (0.08 m)^2 * x

Next, let's calculate the rate of heat transfer by conduction.

The temperature difference between the inner and outer surfaces of the tube can be calculated using the given temperatures:

ΔT = T_inner - T_outer = 700 K - 600 K = 100 K

The cross-sectional area of the tube can be calculated using the inner diameter:

A_cross = π * (diameter/2)^2 = π * (0.08 m)^2

Now, we can calculate the rate of heat transfer by conduction using Fourier's law:

q_cond = k * A_cross * ΔT / L

where k is the thermal conductivity of the tube material and L is the thickness of the tube wall.

Substituting the given values:

q_cond = (12 W.m^-1.K^-1) * (π * (0.08 m)^2) * (100 K) / L

Setting the rates of heat transfer by convection and conduction equal to each other:

500 W.m^-2.K^-1 * π * (0.08 m)^2 * x = (12 W.m^-1.K^-1) * (π * (0.08 m)^2) * (100 K) / L

Solving for x:

x = (12 W.m^-1.K^-1 * 100 K * L) / (500 W.m^-2.K^-1 * π * (0.08 m)^2)

x = 0.0118 * L

To find the value of L, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the thickness of the tube wall is 0.001 m.

Substituting the value of L:

x = 0.0118 * 0.001 m

x = 0.000118 m or 0.118 m

Therefore, the length of the tube is approximately 0.118 m or 118 mm.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing (d) for Chromium using its atomic diameter (a) and the fact that the bcc structure has a face-centered lattice.

The relationship between the lattice parameter (a) and the interplanar spacing (d) for a bcc lattice is:

d = a√(3/4)

Substituting the given atomic diameter (a = 2.494 Å) into this equation, we get:

d = 2.494 Å√(3/4) ≈ 2.152 Å

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the angle of diffraction (θ):

nλ = 2dsinθ

Solving for sinθ, we get:

sinθ = nλ / (2d)

Substituting the given values, we have:

sinθ = (1) * (1.54 Å) / (2 * 2.152 Å) ≈ 0.301

To find the angle of diffraction (θ), we can use the inverse sine function:

θ = sin⁻¹(0.301) ≈ 17.62°

Since the diffraction angles are measured in 2θ, we need to double this value:

2θ = 2 * 17.62° ≈ 35.24°

Now, we can compare this value with the given options to find the correct answer.

2d sinθ = λ

where d is the interplanar spacing, θ is the diffraction angle, and λ is the wavelength of the monochromatic radiation.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing for the (113) set of planes in a face centered cubic lattice. The formula for the interplanar spacing in a face centered cubic lattice is:

d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter.

Substituting h = 1, k = 1, and l = 3, we get:

d = a / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2) = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 9) = a / sqrt(11)

Substituting the given lattice parameter of 0.392 nm, we get:

d = 0.392 nm / sqrt(11) = 0.198 nm

Now we can use the Bragg equation to find the diffraction angle:

2 * 0.198 nm * sin(θ) = 0.1542 nm

Solving for sin(θ), we get:

sin(θ) = 0.1542 nm / (2 * 0.198 nm) = 0.318

To find the diffraction angle in degrees, we can use the inverse sine function:

θ = sin^-1(0.318) = 18.43 degrees

Therefore, the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for face centered cubic Pt using monochromatic radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm is approximately 18.43 degrees.",,,0,

The area of number of atoms centered on a plane to the area of the plane is given by the formula ρplane = Number of atoms centered on a plane / Area of the plane.

For the (100) plane in an fcc crystal, there are two atoms at each corner and one atom at the center of each face. So, the number of atoms centered on the plane is 2 × (number of corners) + 2 × (number of faces) = 2 ×6+2×4=14. The area of the plane is a², where a is the lattice parameter.

(i) Polymers that are less coiled are not necessarily more crystalline than those that are more coiled. The degree of crystallinity in polymers depends on various factors, including the molecular structure, cooling rate, and thermal history, among others.

(ii) Branched polymers can have different crystallinity levels compared to linear polymers, depending on the specific molecular structure and the degree of branching. In some cases, branched polymers may have lower crystallinity due to the hindered molecular motion, while in other cases, they may have higher crystallinity due to the increased intermolecular interactions.

(iii) Polymers with inter-with inter-chain interactions have higher glass transition temperatures than those without inter-chain interactions. Intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonds or van der Waals forces, can enhance the intermolecular interactions and increase the energy required to initiate molecular motion, leading to a higher glass transition temperature.

The Miller indices of Bragg peaks in an X-ray diffraction pattern represent the planes in the crystal lattice that are responsible for the diffraction. The given context describes an X-ray diffraction pattern for a polycrystalline iron sample, and the question asks for the Miller indices of the first three Bragg peaks.

The context does not provide enough information to determine the exact Miller indices, but it does mention that the pattern shows three identical {hkl} planes separated by a common interplanar spacing or d-spacing.

Option C is not correct because the atomic displacement due to the movement of a screw dislocation is perpendicular to the Burgers vector and the dislocation line, not in the direction of the motion of the dislocation line.

First, let's find the molecular weight of one ethylene repeat unit:

Molecular weight of ethylene = 2 * C(12) + 2 * H(1)
= 2 * 12 + 2 * 1
= 22 g/mol

Next, let's find the molecular weight of one repeat unit of $−CH_2−CHCl−$:

Molecular weight of $−CH_2−CHCl−$ = 2 * C(12) + 2 * H(1) + C(12) + Cl(35.5)

Number-averaged molecular weight = $10^(5)gmol^(-1)$ = $100,000gmol^(-1)$

Since the molecular weight of one repeat unit of $−CH_2−CHCl−$ (68.5 g/mol) is less than the given number-averaged molecular weight ($100,000gmol^(-1)$), it cannot be the repeat unit with the higher molecular weight, which is the other repeat unit in the alternating copolymer.

In a body centered cubic crystal, there is one atom at each corner of the unit cell and one atom at the body center. Since the (110) plane is a face plane, it contains all the atoms at the corners and half of the atoms at the body center. Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area of the (110) plane is:

Number of atoms per unit area = Number of atoms per unit cell × Surface area per unit cell / Area of the (110) plane

The surface area per unit cell of a body centered cubic crystal can be calculated by finding the area of one face and multiplying it by the number of faces. Since the (110) plane is a face plane, one face of the unit cell is a (110) plane. The area of one face can be calculated by finding the area of a square with side length 'a' and then multiplying it by a factor of √2 because the shape of the face is a square with two sides of length 'a' and two sides of length '√2a'.

Area of one face = (Side length)² × √2 = a² × √2

The number of faces in a body centered cubic crystal is 6 because it has 12 edges and each edge is shared by 2 faces.

Number of faces = 12 edges / 2 edges per face = 6

The total surface area per unit cell is the sum of the areas of all six faces. Since there are two (110) planes in a unit cell, the total surface area per unit cell is 2 × Area of one face = 2 × a²√2.

The number of atoms per unit cell in a body centered cubic crystal is 2 because it has 2 lattice points.

Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area of the (110) plane is:

Number of atoms per unit area = 2 atoms per unit cell × 2 × a²√2 / a² = 2√2 atoms/m²

The wavelength of the monochromatic X-ray beam is 1.54 Å. Considering first-order reflection, the lattice parameter(in Å) of the crystal is? (Round off to two decimal places)","To find the lattice parameter of the face-centered cubic crystal using the given information, we can use the Bragg equation (10.10) and the relationship between the lattice parameter and the interplanar spacing (dhkl).

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing (dhkl) using the given 2θ value and the wavelength of the monochromatic X-ray beam.

From the Bragg equation (10.10), we have:

2dsinθ = nλ

where d is the interplanar spacing, θ is the scattering angle (equal to 2θ in this case), n is an integer, and λ is the wavelength of the X-ray beam.

Given that θ = 45°, λ = 1.54 Å, and n = 1 (first-order reflection), we can solve for d:

2dsin45° = 1 × 1.54 Å

Using the trigonometric identity sin2θ + cos2θ = 1, we can find cos45°:

cos45° = sqrt(1 - sin245°) = sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3/4)

Now, we can find d:

d = 2sin45°cos45° / λ = 2 × (1/√2) × (√3/2) / 1.54 Å = 1.987 Å

Next, we can find the lattice parameter (a) using the relationship between the lattice parameter and the interplanar spacing for a face-centered cubic lattice:

dhkl = a√h² + k² + l²

We don't have the Miller indices (h, k, l) for this peak, but since we know that the crystal is face-centered cubic, we can assume that the third peak corresponds to a (hkl) plane with relatively small Miller indices, as a crystal with less symmetry has a greater number of peaks. Let's assume that the third peak corresponds to the (200) plane.

For the (200) plane in a cubic structure, we have h² + k² + l² = 2² + 0² + 0² = 4.

So, the lattice parameter (a) can be found as:

"," To find the fraction of vacancies in pure copper at a given temperature, we can use the Boltzmann distribution equation:

x = A exp(-Ef/kT)

where x is the fraction of vacancies, A is a constant, Ef is the energy of formation of vacancies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:

T = 27°C + 273.15 = 290.15 K

Next, we can substitute the given values into the equation:

x = A exp(-0.9 eV/(8.62*$10^(-5)$eV/K)*290.15 K)

To find the value of A, we can use the fact that the total number of vacancies and total number of atoms in the copper sample are related by the equation:

n_v = N x

where n_v is the number of vacancies and N is the total number of atoms in the sample. Since we don't have the total number of atoms in the sample, we cannot directly find the value of A. However, we can express x in terms of the total number of vacancies:

x = n_v/N = n_v/(6.022*$10^23*molar mass of copper)

Substituting this expression into the Boltzmann distribution equation, we get:

n_v = (6.022*$10^23*molar mass of copper)*A*exp(-0.9 eV/(8.62*$10^(-5)$eV/K)*290.15 K)

We can solve for A by rearranging the equation:

A = n_v/(6.022*$10^23*molar mass of copper)*exp(0.9 eV/(8.62*$10^(-5)$eV/K)*290.15 K)

Now we can substitute this expression for A back into the original equation for x:

x = [n_v/(6.022*$10^23*molar mass of copper)]*exp(-0.9 eV/(8.62*$10^(-5)$eV/K)*290.15 K)

To find the numerical value of x, we need to know the molar mass of copper and the number of vacancies in the sample. Without this information, we cannot find the exact value of x. However, we can express x as a function of the number of vacancies and the molar mass of copper:

The text in the context states that an inorganic material that is transparent under solar light appears coloured when doped with transition metal ions. The possible reasons for the colour are:

1. The electronic energy levels of the host materials change significantly by doping.
2. The doped element selectively absorbs certain wavelengths of light other than the perceived colour.

This is known as absorption spectroscopy, and the absorption spectrum of a material can provide information about the electronic structure and the presence of specific impurities or functional groups.

In an FCC lattice, there are four unique lattice parameters: a, b, c, and α. The reciprocal lattice parameters are given by:

h*a = h/a, k*b = k/b, l*c = l/c, and hα* = (h+k+l)/α.

Since there are no restrictions on the signs of h, k, and l, there are three independent Miller indices for each plane in the reciprocal lattice. Therefore, the total number of unique Miller indices is given by:

N = 3 × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × Z³

where Z is the number of atoms in the unit cell. For aluminium, Z = 13.

Substituting the given lattice parameter and the number of atoms in the unit cell, we get:

N = 3 × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × 13³
N = 3 × (1/2) × (1/2) × 27
N = 1728

However, not all of these Miller indices will correspond to physically distinct diffraction peaks. Some of them will correspond to the same peak due to symmetry. In an FCC lattice, there are four three-fold axes passing through the centre of each atom, and each of these axes reduces the number of unique Miller indices by a factor of 4.

Therefore, the maximum number of distinct peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern is given by:

N' = N/4

(give answer up to 2 decimal places).," To calculate the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal, we first need to determine the area of the unit cell in the (110) plane.

The (110) plane is a two-dimensional plane in the three-dimensional BCC crystal lattice. In the given context, the lattice parameter of iron is given as 0.287 nm. We can use this information to calculate the length of the side of the unit cell in the (110) plane.

The side length of the unit cell in the (110) plane can be calculated using the relationship between the lattice parameters in the BCC structure. In a BCC lattice, the side length of the cube is equal to the length of the diagonal of the square face of the cube. Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the lattice parameters a and c:

a² = c² + (a/√2)²

We are given a = 0.287 nm, so we can solve for c:

c² = a² - (a²/2)
c² = 0.287² - 0.287²/2
c² = 0.043184
c ≈ 0.207 nm

Now that we have the side length of the unit cell in the (110) plane, we can calculate the area of the unit cell by squaring the side length:

Area = (side length)²
Area = (0.207 nm)²
Area ≈ 0.0423 nm²

To find the planar atomic density, we need to know the number of atoms in the unit cell in the (110) plane. In a BCC lattice, there are two atoms in the unit cell. Therefore, the planar atomic density is:

Planar atomic density = (number of atoms in the unit cell) / (area of the unit cell)
Planar atomic density = 2 / 0.0423 nm²
Planar atomic density ≈ 47.35 nm²

2d sin θ = λ

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d for the fourth reflection. Since the fourth reflection has Miller indices (hkl) = (111), we can calculate the interplanar spacing using the lattice parameter a:

d = a √h² + k² + l²
d = 3.5 Å √(1² + 1² + 1²)
d = 3.5 Å √3
d = 2.025 Å

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the Bragg angle (2θ):

2d sin θ = λ
2 × 2.025 Å × sin(θ/2) = 1.54056 Å
sin(θ/2) = 0.4515
θ/2 = sin⁻¹(0.4515)
θ = 2 × sin⁻¹(0.4515)
θ = 90° × sin⁻¹(0.4515) / sin(180° / 2)
θ = 90° × sin⁻¹(0.4515) / 0.5
θ = 180° × sin⁻¹(0.4515) / 2
θ = 111.31°

2θ = 180° - 111.31°
2θ = 68.69°

Atomic structure,40,G-XEC-2020-15,NUM,35,"For a FCC metal, the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface is? (round off to two decimal places). Assume that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy. "," According to the context, the surface energy of FCC metals increases with their mechanical strength. The {111} surface has a higher density of atoms compared to the {100} surface, which results in a stronger interatomic bonding and higher surface energy. However, the text does not provide a specific value for the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface for a FCC metal.

To estimate this ratio, we can refer to the Lennard-Jons model provided in the text, which can be used to estimate the cohesive energy per atom. The cohesive energy is related to the surface energy through the number of broken bonds at the surface. Assuming that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy, we can estimate the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface based on the difference in the number of broken bonds per unit area.

The {111} surface has a hexagonal close-packed structure, and the {100} surface has a square structure. The {111} surface has four nearest neighbors for each atom, while the {100} surface has six nearest neighbors for each atom. Therefore, the number of broken bonds per unit area for the {111} surface is lower than that for the {100} surface.

Let's assume that the surface energy is proportional to the number of broken bonds per unit area. Then, the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface can be estimated as:

Surface energy of {111} surface / Surface energy of {100} surface = (Number of broken bonds per unit area for {111} surface) / (Number of broken bonds per unit area for {100} surface)

The number of broken bonds per unit area for the {111} surface can be calculated as:

Number of broken bonds per unit area for {111} surface = 4 * (Number of atoms per unit area) * (Energy per bond)

The number of atoms per unit area for the {111} surface can be calculated as:

Number of atoms per unit area for {111} surface = (Number of atoms in a unit cell) / (Area of the unit cell)

The area of the unit cell for the {111} surface can be calculated as:

Area of the unit cell for {111} surface = (a^2 * sqrt(3)) / 2

where a is the lattice constant of the FCC metal.

Similarly, the number of broken bonds per unit area for the {100} surface can be calculated as:

Number of broken bonds per unit area for {100} surface = 6 * (Number of atoms per unit area) * (Energy per bond)

The number of atoms per unit area for the {100} surface can be calculated as:

Number of atoms per unit area for {100} surface = (Number of atoms in a unit cell) / (Area of the unit cell)

The area of the unit cell for the {100} surface can be calculated as:

Area of the unit cell for {100} surface = a^2

Therefore, the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface can be estimated as:

Surface energy of {111} surface / Surface energy of {100} surface = (4 * (Number of atoms in a unit cell) / (a^2 * sqrt(3)) / 2) / (6 * (Number of atoms in a unit cell) / a^2)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Surface energy of {111} surface / Surface energy of {100} surface = sqrt(3) / 2

Therefore, the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface for a FCC metal is approximately 0.866.

Answer: 0.86

Note: This answer assumes that the surface energy is proportional to the number of broken bonds per unit area and that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy. This may not be an accurate assumption, and the actual ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface for a FCC metal may be different.",,,0,

Fe - 10 atom % C austenite (fcc), having no Fe vacancies, has a lattice parameter of 4 Å. The density of austenite in g $cm^(−3)$ is? (round off to 2 decimal places) "," To find the density of austenite, we first need to determine the mass of one unit cell and then divide it by the volume of the unit cell.

1. Find the mass of one unit cell:
The unit cell contains 4 Fe atoms (each with a mass of 55.8 g/mol) and 10 C atoms (each with a mass of 12.0 g/mol).
So, the mass of one unit cell = (4 × 55.8 g/mol) + (10 × 12.0 g/mol) = 203.04 g/mol

The lattice parameter is given as 4 Å = 4 × 10^-8 cm = 4 × 10^-8 m.
The volume of the unit cell = (4 × 10^-8 m)³ = 64 × 10^-24 m³

The enthalpy required to create an oxygen vacancy in $CeO_2$ is 4 eV. The number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K is? (Round off to the nearest integer)," To find the number of oxygen vacancies per mole of $CeO\_2$ at 1000 K, we can use the given equation for the equilibrium constant of vacancy formation and the ideal gas law.

First, we need to calculate the partition function $W$ using Eq. (3.1) in the context:

$$W = N! \cdot n!(N-n)!$$

where $N$ is the total number of regular atom sites in one mole of $CeO\_2$.

$$N = N\_A \cdot \frac{molar\ mass\ of\ CeO\_2}{molar\ mass\ of\ CeO\_2\ per\ formula\ unit}$$

$$N = 6.02 \cdot 10^{23} \cdot \frac{162.31 g/mol}{55.1 g/mol}$$

$$N = 1.10 \cdot 10^{25}$$

Now, we can calculate the number of oxygen vacancies $n$ using the given equation for the equilibrium constant $K\_c$:

$$K\_c = \frac{[Vacancies]}{[CeO\_2]^{N_{Oxidizer}} \cdot [O\_2]^{N_{Reducer}}}$$

where $N_{Oxidizer}$ and $N_{Reducer}$ are the number of moles of $CeO\_2$ and $O\_2$ per mole of vacancy, respectively.

Since one oxygen vacancy creates one interstitial oxygen atom, the number of moles of $O\_2$ per mole of vacancy is equal to the number of moles of oxygen atoms in one mole of $CeO\_2$.

$$N_{Oxidizer} = 1$$

$$N_{Reducer} = \frac{molar\ mass\ of\ CeO\_2}{molar\ mass\ of\ O\_2}$$

$$N_{Reducer} = \frac{162.31 g/mol}{32.00 g/mol} = 5.07$$

Now, we can calculate the number of oxygen vacancies $n$:

$$K\_c = \frac{n}{N^{N_{Oxidizer}} \cdot [O\_2]^{N_{Reducer}}}$$

$$ln(K\_c) = ln(n) + ln\left(\frac{1}{N^{N_{Oxidizer}}} \cdot [O\_2]^{N_{Reducer}}\right)$$

$$ln(K\_c) = ln(n) + ln\left(\frac{1}{N^{N_{Oxidizer}}} \cdot \left(\frac{P_{O\_2}}{RT}\right)^{N_{Reducer}}\right)$$

where $P_{O\_2}$ is the partial pressure of oxygen in the system, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

We are given the temperature $T = 1000 K$, and we can assume a standard atmospheric pressure of $1 atm = 1.01325 \cdot 10^5 Pa$ for the partial pressure of oxygen.

$$P_{O\_2} = 0.21 \cdot 1.01325 \cdot 10^5 Pa = 2.13 \cdot 10^5 Pa$$

$$R = 8.314 J/mol\cdot K$$

Now, we can calculate the number of oxygen vacancies $n$:

$$ln(K\_c) = ln(n) + ln\left(\frac{1}{(1.10 \cdot 10^{25})^1 \cdot \left(\frac{2.13 \cdot 10^5 Pa}{8.314 J/mol\cdot K \cdot 1000 K}\right)^5.07}\right)$$

$$ln(K\_c) = ln(n) + ln\left(\frac{1}{1.10^{25} \cdot 1.21 \cdot 10^{-11}}\right)$$

$$ln(K\_c) = ln(n) + ln(9.52 \cdot 10^{-13})$$

$$ln(K\_c) = ln(n) - ",,,0,

Given:

We need to find d, the interplanar spacing for the {311} planes. First, we'll calculate sinθ:

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find d:

2d * sinθ = λ
2d * 0.6325 = 0.154 nm
d ≈ 0.248 nm

Finally, we can find the lattice parameter a using the relationship between d and a:

d = a * √(h² + k² + l²)

For the {311} planes, h² + k² + l² = 3² + 1² + 1² = 10

From Eq. (1.10), the inter-planar spacing dhkl is given by the length of the normal vector, which is the product of the direction cosines and the lattice constants. Therefore, the inter-planar spacing of the planes {nh nk nl} would be given by the length of the normal vector in the direction of the reciprocal lattice vector of the planes {nh nk nl}.

From Eq. (2.20c), the distance between two consecutive planes in the reciprocal lattice is 2π|gm|, where gm is the reciprocal lattice vector. Therefore, the inter-planar spacing of the planes {nh nk nl} would be given by 2π|gnh nk nl|.

Substituting nh=h, nk=k, and nl=l into the equation for the reciprocal lattice vector, we have gnh nk nl=1/dhkl=(cos α/dhxl) (cos β/dhyl) (cos γ/dhzl), where dhxl, dhyl, and dhzl are the inter-planar spacings along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.

Therefore, the inter-planar spacing of the planes {nh nk nl} is given by:

dhhn nk nl=2π|gnh nk nl|=2π|(1/dhxl cos α)(1/dhyl cos β)(1/dhzl cos γ)|

According to the context, a unit dislocation with Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0] has a tendency to dissociate into two partial dislocations with smaller Burgers vectors to minimize its elastic strain energy. The Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations can be obtained by finding the vectors that result in a decrease in strain energy when compared to the original Burgers vector.

Using the given Burgers vector, we can find the partial Burgers vectors by looking at the context, which states that the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations are of the a/6(1 12) type. Therefore, we can find the partial Burgers vectors by dividing each component of the Burgers vector by 2.

Grain size of the material is approximately  (A) 45 µm (B) 35 µm (C) 4.5 µm (D) 3.5 µm,"To find the grain size of the material, we can use the Hall-Petch equation (6.25) given by ∆σgbs = kHP√d. We are given the lattice frictional stress ri = 100 MN/$m^2$, the locking parameter kHP = 0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$, and we need to find the grain size d.

First, we need to find the value of kHP in N/mm^3/2. Since kHP = 0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$, we have kHP = 0.10 * (10^6 N/m^2) / (10^(0.5 * 1.5) m^(1.5/2)) = 0.10 * 1728 N/mm^3/2 = 1728 * 0.10 N/mm^3/2 = 1728 * 0.001 N/mm^3/2 = 1.728 N/mm^3/2.

Now, we can use the Hall-Petch equation to find the grain size:

∆σgbs = kHP√d
1.728 N/mm^3/2√d = 100 MN/$m^2$

To find the grain size, we need to take the square root of both sides and then divide by 1.728 N/mm^3/2:

From the text, we know that the first two planes in the X-ray diffraction pattern for an FCC metal have the following Miller indices: (111) and (200). We can use the Bragg equation to find the interplanar spacings for these planes.

The Bragg equation is given by:

nλ = 2d sinθ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the diffraction angle.

For the (111) plane, the diffraction angle θ is given by:

sinθ = h^2 + k^2 + l^2 / 2a^2

where a is the lattice parameter of the FCC metal.

For the (200) plane, the diffraction angle θ is given by:

sinθ = (h^2 + k^2 / a^2 + (l/2)^2) / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 / a^2)

Using the given values of h, k, and l for the (111) and (200) planes, and the lattice parameter a for an FCC metal, we can calculate the interplanar spacings d1 and d2 for these planes using the Bragg equation.

For the (111) plane, we have h=1, k=1, l=1, and a=0.3839 nm. Therefore,

sinθ = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 / 2(0.3839)^2 = 0.622

Using the Bragg equation, we have:

1λ = 2d1 sinθ

Solving for d1, we get:

d1 = λ / (2 sinθ) = 0.3839 nm / (2 * 0.622) = 0.215 nm

For the (200) plane, we have h=2, k=0, l=0, and a=0.3839 nm. Therefore,

sinθ = (2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 / (2 * 0.3839)^2 + 0^2) / √(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 / (2 * 0.3839)^2) = 0.5

Using the Bragg equation, we have:

1λ = 2d2 sinθ

Solving for d2, we get:

d2 = λ / (2 sinθ) = 0.3839 nm / (2 * 0.5) = 0.232 nm

The ratio of the interplanar spacings is:

d1 / d2 = 0.215 nm / 0.232 nm = 0.923

Therefore, the answer is not exactly one of the given options. However, we can see that the ratio is close to 1, so it might be approximated as 1.15 or 1.16. Therefore, none of the given options is correct.

However, it is worth noting that the ratio of interplanar spacings for an FCC metal is not a constant value, as it depends on the specific lattice parameter of the metal.

a = √(2 × 1.431 Å) = √(2.8622 Å²) = 1.753 Å

Now, we can use the Bragg equation to find the interplanar spacing d of (111) planes. The Bragg equation for an FCC crystal is:

d = 2π / √(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the (111) planes. Since the Miller indices for (111) planes are all equal to 1, we have:

d = 2π / √(1² + 1² + 1²) = 2π / √(3) = 2π × √(3) / 2π = √(3) Å

Therefore, the interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium is approximately √(3) Å ≈ 1.732 Å.

Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the question using the context alone.

However, in general, for a simple cubic crystal, the first peak in the X-ray powder pattern corresponds to the (111) plane, and the second peak corresponds to the (200) plane. So, the answer is (C) (200).

Here's the explanation:

In X-ray diffraction, the intensity of the diffracted beam depends on the crystal structure and the orientation of the crystal planes with respect to the incident X-ray beam. For a simple cubic crystal, the planes with the highest symmetry and the strongest scattering are the (111) and (200) planes.

The (111) planes are called the ""cubic planes"" because they contain atoms at the corners of a cube, as well as at the center of each face. The Miller indices (hkl) of a plane are defined as the intercepts of the plane with the three axes of the crystal lattice. In a simple cubic lattice, the (111) planes intercept the axes at the same distance, so their Miller indices are (111).

The (200) planes are called the ""principal planes"" because they contain the most atoms per unit area. They intercept the x and y axes at the same distance, but they intercept the z axis at a distance that is twice the distance to the origin along the z axis. Therefore, their Miller indices are (200).

So, in the X-ray powder pattern of a simple cubic crystal, the first peak corresponds to the (111) planes, and the second peak corresponds to the (200) planes.

Therefore, the answer is (C) (200).

Find x"," To find the value of x, we need to use the given information that the strain energy per unit length of a dislocation is proportional to the square of its Burgers vector.

First, let's find the magnitude of the Burgers vectors for the given dislocations in an FCC crystal:

For a dislocation with Burgers vector (𝑎/2)〈110〉:
b = 𝑎/2

For a dislocation with Burgers vector (𝑎/6)〈112〉:
b = 𝑎/6√(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2)
b = 𝑎/6√(1 + 1 + 4/9)
b = 𝑎/6√(6/9)
b = 𝑎/3

Now, let x be the ratio of the strain energy per unit length of the two dislocations:

x = (Strain energy per unit length of (𝑎/2)〈110〉 dislocation) / (Strain energy per unit length of (𝑎/6)〈112〉 dislocation)

Using the given information that the strain energy per unit length is proportional to the square of the Burgers vector, we have:

x = (Gb^2_((𝑎/2)〈110〉)) / (Gb^2_((𝑎/3)〈112〉))

Substituting the values of the Burgers vectors, we get:

x = (G(𝑎/2)^2) / (G(𝑎/3)^2)

The angle (in degrees) between the dislocation line and its Burger’s vector is,"To find the angle between the dislocation line and its Burgers vector, we can use the dot product of their direction cosines and apply the dot product identity cos(θ) = A.B, where A and B are two vectors and θ is the angle between them.

First, we need to find the direction cosines of the dislocation line [112] and the Burgers vector (a/2)[1 1 0].

The direction cosines of [112] are:
L₁ = 1/√(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) = 1/√(3)
L₂ = 1/√(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) = 1/√(3)
L₃ = -2/√(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) = -2/√(3)

The direction cosines of (a/2)[1 1 0] are:
M₁ = a/2
M₂ = a/2
M₃ = 0

Now, we can calculate the dot product:
A.B = L₁*M₁ + L₂*M₂ + L₃*M₃
= (1/√(3))*(a/2) + (1/√(3))*(a/2) + (-2/√(3))*0
= a/√(3)

Since the Burgers vector and the dislocation line are in the cubic crystal, the angle between them can be found using the inverse cosine function:

θ = cos⁻¹(A.B/|A||B|)
= cos⁻¹(a/√(3)/(a√(2)/2))
= cos⁻¹(√(2)/3)
≈ 60°

So, the angle between the dislocation line and its Burgers vector is approximately 60 degrees.

Atomic structure,68,G-META-16-50,NUM,24,For a bcc metal the ratio of the surface energy per unit area of the (100) plane to that of the (110) plane is,"To find the ratio of the surface energy per unit area of the (100) plane to that of the (110) plane for a bcc metal, we first need to find the surface energies for each plane.

From the context, we have the average surface energy of a solid bcc metal, gsg. However, we don't have specific surface energies for the (100) and (110) planes. To proceed, we'll assume that the surface energies for different planes in a bcc metal are proportional to their respective lattice point densities.

First, let's calculate the lattice point densities for the (100) and (110) planes.

For a bcc lattice, the lattice constant a is the distance between two adjacent atoms along a body diagonal. The volume of the unit cell is given by V = a³.

The number of atoms in the unit cell is given by Z = 2 × (number of atoms in the basis). For a bcc lattice, the basis consists of two atoms at the origin and one atom at (x, x, x), where x = a/2. So, Z = 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of atoms in a plane for each index.

For the (100) plane, the number of atoms in the plane is given by the area of the plane divided by the area of the unit cell. The area of the unit cell is given by A = a², and the area of the (100) plane is given by the area of the square base of the unit cell, which is also a². So, the number of atoms in the (100) plane is N = a² / a² = 1.

For the (110) plane, the number of atoms in the plane is given by the area of the plane divided by the area of the unit cell. The area of the unit cell is given by A = a³, and the area of the (110) plane is given by the area of the rhombus base, which is given by (a√3) / 2. So, the number of atoms in the (110) plane is N = (a√3) / 2 / a³ = (√3) / 2.

Now, let's calculate the surface energy per unit area for each plane. The surface energy per unit area is given by the total surface energy of the plane divided by the area of the plane.

For the (100) plane, the total surface energy is given by the energy of the atoms at the edges and corners of the plane. Since there is one atom in the plane, the total surface energy is given by the energy of one atom at an edge and one atom at a corner. In a bcc lattice, there are two types of edges and corners: edge sharing and corner sharing. Since there is one atom in the plane, there will be one edge-sharing atom and one corner-sharing atom. The energy of an edge-sharing atom is given by √3/4 * gsg, and the energy of a corner-sharing atom is given by √2/4 * gsg. So, the total surface energy for the (100) plane is √3/4 * gsg + √2/4 * gsg = (√3 + √2) / 4 * gsg. The area of the (100) plane is a². So, the surface energy per unit area for the (100) plane is (√3 + √2) / 4 * gsg / a².

For the (110) plane, the total surface energy is given by the energy of the atoms at the edges. Since there are (√3) / 2 atoms in the plane, the total surface energy is given by the energy of one atom at an edge times the number of atoms in the plane, which is (√3) / 2 * gsg. The area of the (110) plane is (a√3) / 2. So, the surface energy per unit area for the (110) plane is (√3) / 2 * gsg / (a√3) / 2 = (√3) / 2 * gsg / (a³)².

Now, we can find the ratio of the surface energy per unit area of the (100) plane to that of the (110) plane:

(Surface energy per unit area of (100) plane) / (Surface energy per unit area of (110) plane) = ((√3 + √2) / 4 * g",,,0,

(answer up to three decimal places)"," To find the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void of a FCC metal, we can use the relationship between the lattice parameter and the radius of an atom in the closest packed structure. In a FCC structure, the radius of an atom is given by r = a/4, where a is the lattice parameter.

The radius of the sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void can be calculated using the relationship between the radius of an atom and the radius of the sphere that fits in the tetrahedral void. The radius of the sphere that fits in the tetrahedral void is given by r\_tetrahedral = (1/2)r, where r is the radius of an atom.

Therefore, we can find the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void of a FCC metal with a lattice parameter of 0.401 nm as follows:

Atomic structure,70,G-META-17-13,NUM,30,"A cubic metal has density of 19000 kg.$m^(-3)$, lattice paramter of 0.4nm and atomic weight of 183. The effective number of atoms in an unit cell of this metal is?","To find the effective number of atoms in the unit cell of the cubic metal, we can use the given density, lattice parameter, and atomic weight.

First, we need to find the mass of one atom:

Mass of one atom = Atomic weight
Mass of one atom = 183 g/mol
Mass of one atom = 183 × 1.66054 × 10^-24 g

Next, we can calculate the volume of the unit cell using the lattice parameter:

Volume of the unit cell = (Lattice parameter)^3
Volume of the unit cell = (0.4 nm)^3
Volume of the unit cell = 0.00064 cubic nanometers

Now, we can find the number of atoms in the unit cell by dividing the total mass of the unit cell by the mass of one atom:

Total mass of the unit cell = Density × Volume of the unit cell
Total mass of the unit cell = 19000 kg/$m^3$ × 0.00064 cubic nanometers
Total mass of the unit cell = 1.21728 × 10^-2 kg

Number of atoms in the unit cell = Total mass of the unit cell / Mass of one atom
Number of atoms in the unit cell = 1.21728 × 10^-2 kg / (183 × 1.66054 × 10^-24 g)
Number of atoms in the unit cell = 6.602 × 10^22

However, since the metal has a cubic lattice structure, the unit cell contains two atoms (one at each corner and one at the center). Therefore, the effective number of atoms in the unit cell is twice the number of atoms calculated above:

Effective number of atoms in the unit cell = 2 × Number of atoms in the unit cell
Effective number of atoms in the unit cell = 2 × 6.602 × 10^22
Effective number of atoms in the unit cell = 1.3204 × 10^23

The assertion [A] states that a reduction in grain size results in a significant increase in creep rate for a material exhibiting Coble creep. The reason [R] given is that grain boundaries act as a barrier to the motion of dislocations.

The correctness of assertion [A] can be verified from the text provided, which states that the Coble creep rate is directly proportional to stress and varies as d^(-1/3), meaning it is more sensitive to grain size than Nabarro-Herring creep. Smaller grain sizes have a larger number of grain boundaries, which increases the Coble creep rate.

We are given the lattice parameter (a = 0.287 nm) and the diffraction angle (θ = 68.7°). We need to find the order of reflection (n).

First, let's calculate the interplanar spacing (d):

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

Since the first peak, h = k = 0 and l = 2, we have:

d = a / √(0² + 0² + 2²) = a / √(2) = a / √(2) * √(2) = a

First, we need to find the lattice plane spacing for the (111) planes in a FCC lattice. The lattice parameter (a) is given, so we can use the relationship between the lattice parameter and the lattice plane spacing for the (111) planes:

d111 = a / √3

Substituting the given lattice parameter (a = 0.3615 nm) into this equation, we get:

2. The Burgers vectors must have the same sign for the same crystal plane.
3. The Burgers vectors must have the same glide plane.

Let's check each reaction against these rules:

(A) (1/2)[0 -1 1] → (1/6)[1 -2 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]
The sum of the Burgers vectors of the reactants is (1/2)[0 -1 1], and the sum of the Burgers vectors of the products is (1/6)[1 -2 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2] = (1/3)[-1 0 2]. These vectors do not have the same crystal plane or the same glide plane, so this reaction is not feasible in a FCC crystal.

(B) (1/2)[1 -1 0] + (1/2)[1 -1 0] → [1 -1 0]
The sum of the Burgers vectors of the reactants is 2(1/2)[1 -1 0] = [1 -1 0], which equals the Burgers vector of the product. Both reactants and the product have the same crystal plane and glide plane, so this reaction is feasible in a FCC crystal.

(C) (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] → (1/2)[1 1 0]
The sum of the Burgers vectors of the reactants is (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] = (1/2)[1 1 0], which equals the Burgers vector of the product. Both reactants and the product have the same crystal plane and glide plane, so this reaction is feasible in a FCC crystal.

(D) (1/2)[-1 0 1] → (1/6)[-2 1 1 ] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]
The sum of the Burgers vectors of the reactant and the product is not the same, so this reaction is not feasible in a FCC crystal.

Therefore, the answer is (A) (1/2)[0 -1 1] → (1/6)[1 -2 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2].",,,0,

The correct reason for the assertion that the rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution of B in A is controlled by the diffusivity of B is that the diffusivity of B atoms determines their ability to move and mix with the host matrix A, which is a key factor in the process of homogenization. The statement that ""atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries"" is true, but it is not the correct reason for the assertion about the control of homogenization rate by diffusivity. The reason is that while atomic migration along dislocations and grain boundaries can contribute to the homogenization process in some cases, the primary mechanism for homogenization in dilute solid solutions is usually the diffusion of solute atoms through the matrix.",,,0,
Atomic structure,82,G-META-21-15,NUM,60,Given: For the symmetric distribution: Probability P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98. The grain size (X) of annealed specimens follows a symmetric distribution with a mean (µ) of 5µm and a standard deviation (σ) of 0.5 µm. The percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is expected to be?(round off to nearest integer) ,"To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm, we first need to calculate the z-score for the lower limit of the range (5 µm) and the upper limit of the range (6 µm) using the given mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ).

The z-score for a given value X is given by:

z = (X - µ) / σ

For the lower limit (5 µm):
z_lower = (5 - 5) / 0.5 = 0

For the upper limit (6 µm):
z_upper = (6 - 5) / 0.5 = 1.2

Now, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between z_lower and z_upper, which corresponds to the percentage of specimens with grain size in the given range.

Using the given symmetric distribution with Probability P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98, we have:

P(Z ≤ 2σ) = 0.98

Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find that the z-score corresponding to a probability of 0.975 (which is close to 0.98) is approximately 1.0.

Therefore, the area under the normal distribution curve between z_lower and z_upper can be approximated as:

Area = Area from z = -∞ to z = 1.2 - Area from z = 1.2 to z = ∞

Using symmetry, we have:

Area = 2 * Area from z = 0 to z = 1.2

Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find that the area under the normal distribution curve from z = 0 to z = 1.2 is approximately 0.3989.

Therefore, the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is:

Percentage = 2 * 0.3989 ≈ 0.798 * 100% ≈ 79.8%

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is approximately 80%.

Explanation: According to the Orowan equation for plastic flow due to dislocation movement, the stress required to move the dislocations is inversely proportional to the square of the spacing between them. The spacing between dislocations is inversely proportional to the square root of the dislocation density. Therefore, the strain rate, which is proportional to the applied stress, is proportional to the square of the dislocation velocity and the square root of the dislocation density. Hence, the relationship between the strain rate, dislocation density, dislocation velocity is given by 𝜖̇ ∝ $𝑣^2$ * $𝜌^{1/2}$.

The half-dislocations or Shockley partials have Burgers vectors of the a/6(1 1 2) type.

The dissociation reaction given in the question can be written as:
(a/2)[1 -1 0] → (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1]

The Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations are (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]. To determine on which plane these two partial dislocations lie, we need to find the planes that intersect along the [1 -1 0] direction and contain the given Burgers vectors.

2d sin θ = λ

where d is the interplanar spacing, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, and θ is the Bragg angle.

First, we need to find the interplanar spacing d using the lattice parameter a:

d = a √(h² + k² + l²)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the second peak. Since the second peak occurs after the first peak in the diffraction pattern, we can assume that the Miller indices have the same values as the first peak but with the next highest integers.

For a FCC lattice, the first peak usually corresponds to the (111) plane. So, we can assume that the second peak corresponds to the (222) plane).

Substituting the given values into the equations:

d = 0.36 nm √(2² + 2² + 2²) = 0.36 nm √(9) = 0.60 nm

We can calculate it using the given atomic radius and the area of the (100) plane.

The area of the (100) plane in an FCC lattice is given by:

Area = a²

where a is the lattice parameter. Since we know the lattice parameter is equal to 4R for FCC, where R is the atomic radius, we can write:

Area = (4R)²

Substituting the given atomic radius of Pb, we get:

Area = (4 × 0.175 nm)²
Area = 0.288 nm²

Now, we can calculate the atomic area density by dividing the number of atoms in the unit cell by the area of the (100) plane:

Atomic area density = Number of atoms in the unit cell / Area of Pb (100) plane

The number of atoms in the unit cell of an FCC lattice is given by:

Number of atoms = 4 + 1 = 5

So,

Atomic area density = 5 / 0.288 nm²
Atomic area density ≈ 17.8 nm²

Finally, to find the number of atoms per unit area, we multiply the atomic area density by the area of the (100) plane:

Number of atoms per unit area = Atomic area density × Area
Number of atoms per unit area = 17.8 nm² × 1 nm²
Number of atoms per unit area ≈ 17.8 nm²

Given: λ = 0.1543 nm, θ = 24.65°

First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:

θ = 24.65° = 0.4318 radians

2θ = 2arcsin(λ/2a√(h² + k² + l²))

Given that the first reflection occurs at a Bragg angle of 30°, we can find the wavelength (λ) using the following relationship:

λ = 2a sin(θ/2)

Substituting θ = 30°, we get:

λ = 2 × 0.052917 nm × sin(15°) = 0.0414 nm

Now, we can find the Bragg angle for the second reflection using the Bragg equation:

2θ₂ = 2arcsin(λ/2a√(h²₂ + k²₂ + l²₂))

Since we don't know the Miller indices (h, k, l) for the second reflection, we can assume that they are related to the first reflection by a simple scaling factor. In FCC crystals, the spacing between adjacent (111) planes is given by:

d₁₁₁ = a√2/2

Assuming that the second reflection corresponds to the (222) planes, we have:

h₂₂₂ = 2h₁₁₁, k₂₂₂ = 2k₁₁₁, l₂₂₂ = 2l₁₁₁

Substituting these values in the Bragg equation, we get:

2θ₂ = 2arcsin(λ/2a√(4h₁₁₁² + 4k₁₁₁² + 4l₁₁₁²))

Substituting h₁₁₁ = 1, k₁₁₁ = 1, and l₁₁₁ = 1, we get:

2θ₂ = 2arcsin(λ/2a√(4(1)² + 4(1)² + 4(1)²))

2θ₂ = 2arcsin(λ/2a√16)

2θ₂ = 2arcsin(λ/2a√4)

(round off to 2 decimal places). ," To find the enthalpy of vacancy formation, we can use the given information about the temperature and the change in vacancy concentration, as well as the definition of the change in free energy for the formation of a vacancy. The change in free energy, ΔG, is given by the equation:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔH is the enthalpy change and TΔS is the entropy change. Since we are given that the vacancy concentration doubles upon increasing the temperature, we can assume that the entropy change is constant and that the temperature change is 100°C.

First, we need to find the vacancy concentration at each temperature. We are given that at 27°C, there is one vacancy per 10^15 lattice atoms, so the vacancy concentration is:

n_v(27°C) = 1 / (10^15)

At 127°C, the vacancy concentration is twice this value, so:

n_v(127°C) = 2 * n_v(27°C) = 2 / (10^15)

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

We are given that ΔG = 0 at both temperatures (since we are in thermodynamic equilibrium), so:

0 = ΔH - TΔS

We can rearrange this equation to find ΔH:

ΔH = TΔS

We are given that the temperature change is 100°C, so T = 350.15 K (since T = 27°C + 100°C). We are also given that R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$, so:

ΔS = R * ln(n_v(127°C) / n_v(27°C))

Using the given vacancy concentrations, we can calculate ΔS:

ΔS = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$ * ln(2 / 1) = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$ * ln(2) = 1.0986 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$

Now we can find ΔH:

ΔH = TΔS = 350.15 K * 1.0986 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$ = 3868.3 J $mol^(-1)$ = 3.86 kJ $mol^(-1)$

Therefore, the enthalpy of vacancy formation is approximately 3.86 kJ $mol^(-1)$.",,,0,
Atomic structure,97,G-META-21-53,NUM,38,Assume the radius of Fe atom to be 0.124 nm. The radius of an interstitial atom which just fits(without distorting the structure) inside an octahedral void of a bcc-iron crystal (in nm) is?(round off to 3 decimal places)," To find the radius of an interstitial atom that fits inside an octahedral void of a bcc-iron crystal without distorting the structure, we can use the perfect sphere model and the fact that the octahedral void in a bcc crystal has a diameter of about 0.072 nm in the Fe lattice.

The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:

V = (4/3)πr³

We can set up an equation for the volume of the sphere to be equal to the volume of the octahedral void:

(4/3)πr³ = (1/2)a³(√3/4)(1 - √(1/4 + (r/a)²))³

where a is the lattice parameter of the bcc crystal.

Substituting the given value of a = 0.41r (where r is the radius of the Fe atom), we get:

(4/3)πr³ = (1/2)(0.41r)³(√3/4)(1 - √(1/4 + (r/0.41r)²))³

Solving for r, we get:

r = 0.154 nm

(A) Fine grain size (B) FCC crystal structure (C) High melting point (D) Cold worked microstructure ","[C, High melting point]

Explanation: According to the context provided, a material with a high melting point is desirable for achieving better creep resistance in high-temperature applications. This is because creep occurs to a greater extent at a homologous temperature greater than about 0.5, and the diffusion coefficient on which creep rate depends is lower in materials with high melting points. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Options A, B, and D are not directly related to achieving better creep resistance in high-temperature applications based on the context provided. A fine grain size (Option A) may be beneficial for other reasons such as improving strength and reducing grain boundary diffusion, but it is not the only factor for achieving better creep resistance. An FCC crystal structure (Option B) is not necessarily related to creep resistance, as different crystal structures can exhibit varying creep properties depending on other factors. A cold worked microstructure (Option D) can increase strength but may also increase the risk of creep damage due to the presence of dislocations.",,,0,

The spacing(in nm) between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary is? (round off to 2 decimal places). ,"To find the spacing between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary, we can use the given equation (n = 1 / (h * sin(θ/2))), where h is the magnitude of the Burgers vector and θ is the tilt angle in radians.

First, we need to convert the tilt angle from degrees to radians:

θ = 2° = 0.0349 radians

Next, we can find the magnitude of the Burgers vector using the lattice parameter:

b = √2 * a
where a is the lattice parameter
b = √2 * 0.143 nm = 0.211 nm

Now, we can calculate the spacing between the dislocations:

h = 1 / (n * sin(θ/2))
h = 1 / (1 * sin(0.0174))
h = 1 / 0.0174
h = 57.3 nm

The Young’s modulus of steel ($E_(steel)$) is 200 GPa, and of aluminium ($E_(Al)$) is 70 GPa. The Poisson’s ratio (ν) can be taken as 0.3. When the same load is applied to an aluminium bar, it is found to give same elastic strain as the steel. Calculate the cross-sectional area of the aluminium bar.  (A) 11.43 $cm^2$ (B) 14.93 $cm^2$ (C) 18.26 $cm^2$ (D) 22.86 $cm^2$ "," To find the cross-sectional area of the aluminum bar, we first need to determine the elastic strain in both materials under the given load.

The elastic strain (ε) is defined as the applied load divided by the product of the Young's modulus and the cross-sectional area:

ε = F / (E * Ω)

For the steel bar:
F = 20 kN = 20,000 N
E_(steel) = 200 GPa = 200,000,000 Pa
Ω = 8 cm² = 8000 mm² = 8 × 10⁴ m²

ε_(steel) = 20,000 N / (200,000,000 Pa * 8 × 10⁴ m²) = 1 × 10⁻⁶

Now, we know that the aluminum bar experiences the same elastic strain under the same load. We can use this information to find its cross-sectional area:

ε = F / (E * Ω)
ε = 20,000 N / (E_(Al) * Ω_(Al))

We are given that ε = 1 × 10⁻⁶, and we know the values of F, E_(steel), and ε. We can solve for Ω_(Al) as follows:

Ω_(Al) = 20,000 N / (E_(Al) * 1 × 10⁻⁶)

Substituting the given values:

Ω_(Al) = 20,000 N / (70 GPa * 1 × 10⁻⁶) = 28,571,428,571,429 m²

To convert this value to cm²:

Ω_(Al) = 28,571,428,571,429 m² * (1 cm)² / (1 m)² = 2.8571428571429 × 10¹⁴ cm²

Taking the square root of this value to find the side length of the aluminum bar's cross-section:

Side length = √Ω = √(2.8571428571429 × 10¹⁴ cm²) = 5,344,356.22 cm

The area of a square cross-section is equal to the side length squared:

Ω_(Al) = (side length)² = (5,344,356.22 cm)² = 28,571,428,571,429 cm²

To find the cross-sectional area in the given units (cm²), we divide the calculated area by 1,000,000:

Ω_(Al) = 28,571,428,571,429 cm² / 1,000,000 = 28,571,429 cm²

Young's modulus of composite = 185 GPa
Young's modulus of fibers (SiC) = 360 GPa

Volume fraction of fibers = [(185 GPa - 110 GPa) / (360 GPa - 110 GPa)]

When the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm, the expected yield strength(MPa) is ? ","To find the expected yield strength when the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm, we can use the Hall-Petch relationship:

Rp0.2 = σs + kd

where Rp0.2 is the yield strength, σs is the strength due to solid solution, and k is the Hall-Petch constant. The grain size d is given in meters, so we need to convert the given grain sizes to meters.

First, let's find the yield strength increase due to grain size reduction from 256 μm to 64 μm:

d1 = 256 × 10^-6 m
d2 = 64 × 10^-6 m

ΔRp0.2 = 150 - 120 = 30 MPa

Using the Hall-Petch relationship:

30 = k(d2 - d1)

Solving for k:

k = 30 / (d2 - d1) = 30 / (192 × 10^-12) = 158.1 MPa·m^(1/2)

Now, let's find the expected yield strength when the grain size is 16 μm:

d3 = 16 × 10^-6 m

Using the Hall-Petch relationship:

Rp0.2 = σs + kd

We don't have the value of σs, but we can find the contribution of grain size to the yield strength:

ΔRp0.2 = k(d2 - d1) + k(d3 - d2)

Solving for Rp0.2:

Rp0.2 = σs + k(d2 - d1) + k(d3 - d2)

Substituting the values:

Rp0.2 = σs + 158.1 * (192 × 10^-12 - 128 × 10^-12) + 158.1 * (128 × 10^-12 - 64 × 10^-12)

Rp0.2 = σs + 158.1 * (64 × 10^-12)

Since we don't have the value of σs, we cannot find the exact yield strength. However, we can find the contribution of grain size to the yield strength increase:

ΔRp0.2 = 158.1 * (64 × 10^-12) = 10.1 GPa

So, so the expected yield strength increase when the grain size is reduced to 16 μm is approximately 10.1 GPa. To find the actual yield strength, we would need to know the value of σs.

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What is the relaxation time constant for this material?","To find the relaxation time constant, we need to use the given stress and strain values, as well as the time elapsed, to calculate the prefactor A0 in equation (7.80). Once we have A0, we can find the relaxation time constant using the relationship tr = η/(E1 + E2), where E1 and E2 are the elastic and viscous moduli, respectively.

First, let's find A0 using the given information:

From equation (7.80), we have:

1 / C01 * (n/C01) = 1 / C0A0 * (Et / n)

We know that the initial stress ri = 10 MPa, the final stress rf = 5 MPa, and the time t = 40 days = 1.152 x 10^7 seconds. We also know that n is independent of stress and temperature, so we can assume a value based on the given temperature (20°C) and assuming a glass transition temperature of 40°C higher, i.e., 60°C).

Using the given equation (7.79), we can find the value of C:

C = (rn/C01) * (i / (rn/C01))

We don't have the value of rn directly, but we can find it using the given stress and strain values:

ε = η / (E * rn)

We know that ε = 0.5 and E = 1 MPa (assuming a Young's modulus of 1 MPa for the elastomer at 20°C). We can find rn using this equation:

rn = η / (0.5 * 1 MPa)

Now we can find C:

C = (rn/C01) * (i / (rn/C01))

C = (rn/C01) * (i * C01 / rn)

C = i * C01

Now we can find A0:

A0 = 1 / (C * C01)

A0 = 1 / (i * C01 * rn / η)

A0 = η / (i * C01 * rn)

Now we can find the relaxation time constant tr:

tr = η / (E1 + E2)

We don't have the values of E1 and E2 directly, but we can estimate them based on the given temperature and the glass transition temperature. We can assume that E1 is the elastic modulus at the glassy state (assuming a value of 1 GPa for the elastomer at the glass transition temperature), and E2 is the viscous modulus at the rubbery state (assuming a value of 10 MPa for the elastomer at 20°C).

tr = η / (1 GPa + 10 MPa)

tr = η / (1.01 x 10^9 Pa)

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What will be the stress after 60 days at 20°C?","To determine the stress after 60 days at 20°C, we first need to find the strain rate and the time it takes for the stress to decrease from 10 MPa to 5 MPa.

Given that the strain is held constant at 50%, the elastomer undergoes a deformation that can be described by a strain-stress relationship. Let's assume that the strain-stress relationship for this elastomer follows the Mooney-Rivlin equation:

σ = C₁ + C₂ε + C₃ε²

where σ is the stress, ε is the strain, and C₁, C₂, and C₃ are material constants. Since the strain is constant at 50%, we can write:

10 MPa = C₁ + C₂(0.5) + C₃(0.5)²

To find the stress after 60 days, we need to determine the strain rate and the time it takes for the stress to decrease from 10 MPa to 5 MPa.

First, let's find the strain rate:

The strain rate is given by the negative of the time derivative of the strain:

dε/dt = -dσ/dt / E

where E is the Young's modulus of the elastomer. Since the strain is constant, the time derivative of the strain is zero, and we can write:

dσ/dt = -E(dε/dt)

We don't have the exact value of the strain rate, but we can find it by using the given information that the stress decreases from 10 MPa to 5 MPa in 40 days.

Let's call the strain rate ""r"":

10 MPa = σ₀
5 MPa = σₙ
t₀ = 40 days

Using the Mooney-Rivlin equation, we can write:




σ₀ = C₁ + C₂ε₀ + C₃ε₀²
σₙ = C₁ + C₂εₙ + C₃εₙ²

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get

(σ₀ - σₙ) = (C₂ + 2C₃) (ε₀ - εₙ)

Now, we can use the given information to find the strain difference:

ε₀ - εₙ = 50% - 50% = 0

So, σ₀ - σₙ = 0

This means that C₂ + 2C₃ = 0, which is not possible since both C₂ and C₃ are material constants. This means that the given information is not consistent with the Mooney-Rivlin equation.

Therefore, we cannot determine the stress after 60 days at 20°C using the given information.

(round off to the nearest integer)","To find the engineering stress when the engineering strain is 0.12, we need to use the given relationship between true and engineering stresses during plastic deformation.

From the text, we know that:

True stress = 𝜎(𝜀) = 600𝜀^𝑛

And,

True strain = 𝜀

We are given that when true strain is 0.05, the true stress is 350 MPa. So, we can find the value of n (strain hardening exponent) by solving the given equation for 𝜀:

350 MPa = 600𝜀^𝑛

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, we get:

log10(350) = log10(600) + log10(𝜀^𝑛)

Using the property of logarithms, we can separate the terms:

log10(𝜀^𝑛) = log10(600) - log10(350)

Now, taking the exponent of base 10, we get:

𝜀^𝑛 = 600 / 350 ≈ 1.714

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides of the given equation, we get:

log10(𝜎) = 600𝜀^𝑛) = log10(600) + log10(𝜀^𝑛)

Substituting the value of log10(𝜀^𝑛) that we found earlier, we get:

log10(𝜎) = log10(600) + log10(1.714) ≈ 3.217

So, 𝜎 = 10^3.217 ≈ 620 MPa

Now, we can use the relationship between true and engineering stresses to find the engineering stress when the engineering strain is 0.12:

Engineering stress = True stress / (1 + n𝜀)

Substituting the values we found, we get:

Engineering stress = 620 MPa / (1 + 1.714 * 0.12) ≈ 555 MPa

(round off to the nearest integer),"To find the stress required to change the polarization, we need to use the given Young's modulus (E) and the change in polarization density (ΔP). We can then use the Legendre relation to find the stress.

First, we need to convert the given polarization density from C m^(-3) to N m^(-2).

640 C m^(-3) = 6.4 × 10^6 N m^(-2)

Now, we can use the Legendre relation:

ΔP = ε0 * Δεr + εm * Δσ

where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10^(-12) F m^(-1)), εm is the permittivity of the material, and Δεr is the change in the relative permittivity.

Since we don't have the values for εm and Δεr, we cannot directly use the Legendre relation. However, we can use the given Young's modulus (E) and the piezoelectric strain constant (d33) to find the relative permittivity (εr) using the following equation:

εr = (1 + 2 * d33^2 / E)

We don't have the value for d33, but we can use the given Young's modulus to find it using the following equation:

d33 = sqrt(E / (2 * (1 + ν) * ρ))

where ν is the Poisson's ratio (assumed to be 0.35 for this material), and ρ is the mass density (we don't have this value, but it can be calculated using the given Young's modulus and mass density of the epoxy matrix).

First, let's find the Poisson's ratio:

ν = (E / 3) * (1 - 2 / 3 * εm)

We don't have the value for εm, but we can use the given Young's modulus and mass density of the epoxy matrix to find it using the following equation:

E = 3 * εm * (1 - 2 * ν^2)

We have the following values:

E = 72 GPa = 7.2 × 10^10 Pa
ν = 0.35

First, let's find εm:

E = 3 * εm * (1 - 2 * ν^2)
7.2 × 10^10 Pa = 3 * εm * (1 - 2 * (0.35)^2)

Solving for εm:

εm = 1.32 × 10^11 F m^(-1)

Now, let's find d33:

d33 = sqrt(E / (2 * (1 + ν) * ρ))
d33 = sqrt(7.2 × 10^10 Pa / (2 * (1 + 0.35) * ρ))

We don't have the value for ρ, but we can use the given mass density of the piezoelectric material (72 GPa) to find it:

ρ = E / (3 * εm)
ρ = 7.2 × 10^10 Pa / (3 * 1.32 × 10^11 F m^(-1))
ρ = 5.5 × 10^3 kg m^(-3)

Now, let's find d33:

d33 = sqrt(7.2 × 10^10 Pa / (2 * (1 +1 0.35) * 5.5 × 10^3 kg m^(-3)))
d33 = 2.3 × 10^(-2) C m^(-1) N^(-1)

εr = (1 + 2 * d33^2 / E)
εr = (1 + 2 * (2.3 × 10^(-2) C m^(-1) N^(-1))^2 / 7.2 × 10^10 Pa)
εr = 1.002

(round off to nearest integer)"," To calculate the Vickers hardness, we can use the formula given by equation (3.17) in the text:

where P is the applied load (10 kg) and A is the surface area of the elastically recovered pyramidal indentation.

First, we need to find the lateral area (A) of the pyramidal indentation. From the text, we know that the length of each arm of the square base of the pyramidal indentation (a) is related to the average diagonal length (D) by the equation:

a² = D² / 4

A = 4a² / C2 = 4 x 0.0625 mm² / C2 = 0.025 mm²

Explanation:

The given problem describes a polymer matrix composite reinforced with long continuous ceramic fibers aligned in one direction. The question asks for the Young's modulus of the composite in a direction perpendicular to the length of the fibers, assuming an isostress condition.

The rule of mixtures is a common method used to estimate the elastic properties of composite materials. In the case of parallel loading, the rule of mixtures states that the composite's Young's modulus is given by the sum of the products of the volume fraction and Young's modulus of each constituent material.

However, in the given problem, the loading direction is perpendicular to the fibers, which is referred to as serial connection. In this case, the balance of forces must hold at each fiber-matrix interface.

To simplify matters, the problem assumes that the fibers are plates extending over the whole cross section of the material and oriented perpendicularly to the applied load.

Using the rule of mixtures, the Young's modulus of the composite can be calculated as:

$E\_C = Em(1-f) + E\_ff$

Since the fibers are stiffer than the matrix, $E\_f > Em$, and the volume fraction of the fibers is $f$, the final expression for the Young's modulus of the composite is:

$E\_C = (1-f)Em + fE\_f$

Therefore, the answer is (A) $E\_C = (1-f)Em + fE\_f$.",,,0,

First, let's calculate the strain rate during hot extrusion. The initial diameter is 10 cm or 0.1 m, and the final diameter is 5 cm or 0.05 m. The velocity is given as 2 cm/s or 0.02 m/s. The volume of the billet remains constant during extrusion, so the cross-sectional area decreases as the diameter decreases. The relationship between the initial and final areas is:

A1 = π(D1^2) and A2 = πD2^2

Since A1/A2 = (D1/D2)2, we can write:

D1/D2 = (A1/A2)1/2

Now, let's calculate the strain rate:

ε = v/D

During hot extrusion, the velocity is constant, so the strain rate is inversely proportional to the diameter:

ε = ε0 * (D0/D)

where ε0 is the initial strain rate and D0 is the initial diameter.

Substituting the given values, we have:

ε = 0.02/(0.1) = 0.02 m/s * (0.05 m/0.1 m)2 = 0.0016 m/s

Now, let's find the flow stress:

Since the answer is not exactly provided in the options, it's important to note that the given relationship between flow stress and strain rate is an approximation. The actual value may vary depending on the specific alloy and processing conditions.

Yield strength of the material is approximately  (A) 100 MPa (B) 115 MPa (C) 165 MPa (D) 215 MPa," To find the yield strength of the material using the Hall-Petch equation, we need to use the given values of lattice frictional stress (ri), locking parameter (Ky), and grain size (d). The Hall-Petch equation is given by:

r0 = ri + Ky * d^(0.5)

We are given ri = 100 MN/$m^2$ and Ky = 0.10 MN/$m^{(1.5)}$. We need to find the yield strength (r0) in MPa.

First, we need to convert the given values to SI units:

ri = 100 * 10^6 MN/$m^2$ = 100,000 MPa
Ky = 0.10 MN/$m^{(1.5)}$ = 0.10 * (10^3 N/m^3) / (2^(0.5) * 10^(0.5) m^(1.5)) = 0.0141 MN/m^2

Now, we can use the Hall-Petch equation to find the yield strength:

r0 = ri + Ky * d^(0.5)

We need to find the grain size (d) in meters. ASTM No. 6 corresponds to a grain size of approximately 1.35 mm or 1.35 * 10^-3 m.

First, we need to find the value of K for this metal. We are given that the increase in yield strength on decreasing the grain size from 64 µm to 25 µm is 45 MPa. Using the Hall-Petch equation, we can write:

145 MPa = Y0 + K(25 µm)^(-1/2)
100 MPa = Y0 + K(64 µm)^(-1/2)

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

45 MPa = K[(64 µm)^(-1/2) - (25 µm)^(-1/2)]

Solving for K, we get:

K = 45 MPa * [(64 µm)^(-1/2) / (25 µm)^(-1/2)]
K = 112.8 MPa * sqrt(2.56)
K = 155.6 MPa

From the text, we know that the strain rate is related to the crosshead velocity and the original gauge length of the specimen:

Engineering strain rate, _e = dL/dt = v/L0 (1:145a)

where v is the crosshead velocity and L0 is the original gauge length.

We are given that the crosshead speed is 6 mm/min and the initial strain rate is 5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$. We can find the crosshead velocity as:

v = crosshead speed = 6 mm/min

0.405 = ln(L/L0)

We know that L0 + DL = L (where DL is the change in gauge length) and L = L0 + DL. Substituting these values into the equation:

0.405 = ln((L0 + DL)/L0)

Now, let's find L:

L = L0 + DL = L0 + 5

Substitute L and L0 into the equation:

0.405 = ln((L0 + 5)/L0)

To solve for L, first, we need to find the numerator:

L0 + 5 = e^(0.405 * L0)

Now, divide both sides by L0:

1 + 5/L0 = e^(0.405)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1 + 5/L0) = ln(e^(0.405))

Use the property of log(ln(a^b) = b*ln(a)):

ln(1 + 5/L0) = 0.405*ln(e)

Now, use the value of ln(e) = 1:

ln(1 + 5/L0) = 0.405

To find L, we need to find the value of 1 + 5/L0:

1 + 5/L0 = e^(0.405)

Now, take the exponential of both sides:

1 + 5/L0 = 1.4686

Subtract 1 from both sides:

5/L0 = 0.4686

Now, multiply both sides by L0:

5 = 0.4686 * L0

Divide both sides by 0.4686:

L0 = 10.67 mm

Total strain (εtotal) = Stress / Young's modulus
εtotal = 400 MPa / 200 GPa = 0.002

Since the rod is completely unloaded, the elastic strain (εelastic) is the strain that has been recovered. The elastic strain is defined as the partial strain that occurs up to the elastic limit, which is the strain that is fully reversible.

To find the elastic strain, we need to know the elastic limit of the material. Let's assume that the elastic limit is 300 MPa. We can then calculate the elastic strain using the following equation:

Elastic strain (εelastic) = Total strain up to elastic limit
εelastic = σelastic / Young's modulus

We can find the stress at which the elastic strain occurs by using the given stress value and the elastic limit:

σelastic = Elastic limit * Elastic strain

Here, we are given that kd ≈ 0.1, G = 25.4 GPa, b = 2.86×10−10m, and ϱ = 1/(2λ).

First, we need to find the new value of λ when inter-precipitate spacing is 200 nm. Since each penetration point in a plane perpendicular to the dislocation occupies an area of 2λ·2λ, the new value of λ can be found by:

√ϱ = 1/2λ
1/√ϱ = 2λ
1/√(1/(2λ)) = 2λ

∆σd = kdMGb√ϱ
∆σd = 0.1×25.4×10^9×2.86×10^-10×1/(0.2828×10^-9)^2

D = Lc / (h1 + h2)

where h1 is the height of the ingoing stock (billet), h2 is the height of the outgoing product (pancake), and Lc is the contact length between the die and the work-piece in the deformation zone.

First, we need to find the contact length Lc. Since the billet is undergoing upset forging, the expression for the contact length is:

Lc = h1 / (1 + (h2 / h1))

Now, we can substitute the given values:

h1 = 1.0 m
h2 = 0.25 m

Lc = 1.0 m / (1 + (0.25 m / 1.0 m))
Lc = 1.0 m / (1 + 0.25)
Lc = 1.0 m / 1.25
Lc ≈ 0.8 m

Next, we can find the diameter of the pancake using the given expression for the parameter D:

D = Lc / (h1 + h2)

D = 0.8 m / (1.0 m + 0.25 m)
D = 0.8 m / 1.25 m

Explanation:

The text suggests that the driving force for sintering a compact is related to the surface area and the grain boundary area. When the particle size is reduced, the surface area per particle decreases, leading to a decrease in the driving force for sintering. The text also mentions that the Zener drag equation overestimates the driving force for grain growth, indicating that there is a more complex relationship between particle size and driving force.

where:
- Tc is the critical stress (fracture strength)
- Ysv is the surface energy
- c is the crack length
- E is the elastic modulus

First, we need to find the crack length c in medium P, given the fracture strength of 300 MPa:

Mechanical,42,G-META-16-19,MCQS,22,Creep resistance decreases due to  (A) Small grain size (B) Fine dispersoid size (C) Low stacking fault energy (D) High melting point ," The given context suggests that creep resistance decreases with small grain size (A). The reason being that a fine grain size increases the grain boundary area per unit volume, which increases the likelihood of grain-boundary sliding and grain-boundary diffusion, both of which contribute to creep deformation. Additionally, the context states that in fine-grained materials, the smaller grain boundaries have a higher density of dislocations, which can interact with dispersoids and impede dislocation motion, but this interaction also requires a higher stress to detach the dislocation from the dispersoid, making it less effective in increasing creep resistance at lower temperatures. Therefore, the overall creep resistance is lower in fine-grained materials.

However, it's important to note that there are other factors that can increase creep resistance, such as high melting point (B in the question), which makes the climbing process more difficult, and low stacking fault energy (C in the question), which makes it harder for dislocations to cross grain boundaries and form subgrains, reducing the likelihood of grain-boundary sliding and grain growth.

- E_comp is the elastic modulus of the composite,
- V_f is the volume fraction of the reinforcement (glass fiber),
- E_f is the elastic modulus of the reinforcement (glass fiber),

E_comp = (28 GPa + 2.1 GPa) / 1

E_comp = 29.9 GPa

Explanation:

Nabarro-Herring creep occurs when vacancies diffuse through the grain interiors, while Coble creep occurs when vacancies diffuse along the grain boundaries. The grain size and temperature affect the dominant deformation mechanism in different ways.

Nabarro-Herring creep is favored at high homologous temperatures, which means higher temperatures relative to the material's melting point. It is also favored in larger grains because the shortest path for diffusion is through the grain interiors.

On the other hand, Coble creep is favored at lower homologous temperatures and for smaller grain sizes. This is because the activation energy for grain boundary diffusion is lower than that for lattice diffusion, making diffusion more rapid through the grain boundaries. Additionally, smaller grain sizes have a higher density of grain boundaries, which increases the likelihood of Coble creep occurring.

Therefore, the answer is (B) smaller grain size and higher temperature.",,,0,

* v: instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod

According to the conservation of energy principle, the initial potential energy of the rod is equal to the sum of its final kinetic energy and potential energy:

mgh = (1/2)mv² + mgh'

where h' is the height of the top of the rod above the ground level. Since the bottom of the rod is 30 cm away from the wall, and the rod is 50 cm long, the height h can be calculated as follows:

h = 30 cm + 50 cm = 80 cm = 0.8 m

Now, we can solve for the velocity v:

mgh = (1/2)mv² + mgh'
0.8g = (1/2)v² + v²sinθ

where θ is the angle between the rod and the ground. Since the rod is placed against a vertical wall, θ is equal to 90 degrees, and sinθ is equal to 1. Rearranging the equation, we get:

Explanation:
Coble creep is a diffusional creep mechanism that occurs due to the grain boundary diffusion of vacancies. It is named after the scientist who first proposed this mechanism, R. W. Coble. Therefore, the statement that Coble creep occurs via grain boundary diffusion is actually true.

The other statements are true as follows:

(A) The minimum creep rate is obtained in the primary stage (stage I).
This is true because the primary stage of creep is characterized by a decreasing creep rate, which eventually reaches a minimum value.

(B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size.
This is true because smaller grain sizes increase the area available for diffusional flow mechanisms, making it easier for creep deformation to occur.

Explanation:

Necking instability occurs when the rate of change of true stress with respect to true strain is zero, meaning that an increase in true strain produces no increase in the true stress supported by the material.

Since dσ/dε represents the hardening rate and is positive for strain-hardening materials, the only way for dσ/dε to be zero is if dA/dε is infinite or dA = 0.

Given:

Re = ρvL/μ

where L is the characteristic length (in this case, the radius of the steel ball). Solving for v:

v = Re * μ / ρ * L

v = 5 * 10^(5) * 1 * 10^(–3) Pa.s / 2360 kg/m³ * R

Now we can find the force:

σ = 700 $(ε)^0.2$ MPa

First, we need to find the strain ε after a 50% reduction in area. Since the volume of the rod remains constant during the rolling process, a 50% reduction in area means a corresponding 50% increase in length. Therefore, the strain can be calculated as:

ε = ln(new length / original length)

Let's assume the original length of the rod is L0. After the 50% reduction in area, the new length is 1.5 * L0.

First, let's find the value of ε when the true stress is equal to the maximum true stress (ultimate tensile strength). We can use the given equation σ = 1050 * $ε^{0.25}$ and set it equal to the ultimate tensile strength.

1050 * $ε^{0.25}$ = ultimate tensile strength

Let's assume the ultimate tensile strength is 500 MPa.

500 MPa = 1050 * $ε^{0.25}$

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides,

log10(500 MPa / 1050) = log10($ε^{0.25}$)

Using the property of logarithms,

log10(500 / 1050) + log10($ε^{0.25}$) = 0

Now, we can use the property of logarithms again to separate the variables.

log10(500 / 1050) = -log10($ε^{0.25}$)

Taking the exponent of both sides,

$10^{log10(500 / 1050)} = 10^{-log10($ε^{0.25}$)}$

$0.00241 = ε^{0.25}$

Taking the logarithm base e of both sides,

loge($0.00241$) = 0.25 * loge($ε$)

Using the property of logarithms again,

loge($0.00241$) - 0.25 * loge($ε$) = 0

Solving for loge($ε$),

loge($ε$) = loge($0.00241$) / (1 - 0.25)

Using a calculator, we find that loge($ε$) = 1.3113.

Taking the exponent of both sides,

$ε$ = $10^{1.3113}$

$ε$ = 3.115

Now that we have the value of ε when the true stress is equal to the ultimate tensile strength, we can find the maximum true uniform strain by differentiating the given equation σ = 1050 * $ε^{0.25}$ with respect to ε and setting it equal to zero.

d(σ)/d(ε) = 1050 * 0.25 * $ε^{0.25-1}$ = 0

Solving for ε,

$ε$ = ($1050$ / $0.25$)$^(1/0.25)$ = 12.625

Taking the true strain at the point of maximum load, we have:

eu = ln(σ0/σ) = ln(1050 / 12.625) = 0.313

Therefore, the maximum true uniform strain that can be imparted to a material obeying σ = 1050 * $ε^{0.25}$ is eu = 0.313.

The fracture stress (in MPa) is?"," To determine the fracture stress for the given glass plate with two parallel cracks, we need to calculate the stress intensity factor (SIF) for both internal and surface cracks separately and then use the appropriate equation to find the fracture stress.

First, let's calculate the SIF for the internal crack:

SIF_int = Y * sqrt(a / w)
where Y is Young's modulus, a is the crack length, and w is the width of the plate. Since the crack is internal, the width w is equal to the plate thickness.

SIF_int = 70 GPa * sqrt(5 μm / t)

Next, let's calculate the SIF for the surface crack:

SIF_surf = Y * sqrt(2 * a / w)

SIF_surf = 70 GPa * sqrt(2 * 3 μm / (t - 3 μm))

Now, we can use the fracture stress equation for plane stress condition:

For the internal crack:

σ_f_int = (2 * SIF_int^2 / E)

For the surface crack:

σ_f_surf = (2 * SIF_surf^2 / E)

Since we don't have the plate thickness t in the problem statement, we cannot directly calculate the fracture stress. However, we can calculate the ratio of the fracture stresses for the internal and surface cracks:

Using the given relationship between compacting pressure and green density, we can find the theoretical density:

Theoretical density = Density at 150 MPa / 0.55

Now, we can calculate the linear shrinkage:

Linear shrinkage = (1 - Sintered density / Green density) * 100%
Linear shrinkage = (1 - 0.865 / 0.55) * 100%
Linear shrinkage = 35.22%

So, the linear shrinkage of the tungsten powder compact during sintering is approximately 35.22%.",,,0,

rf = (EGc)1/2

where E is the Young's modulus, Gc is the critical elastic strain energy release rate, and rf is the fracture strength.

First, we need to find the critical elastic strain energy release rate (Gc) for the given material. Since it's a surface crack and we're under plane strain condition, we can use equation (9.35b) as follows:

Gc = 20/C2103 * cs

where cs is the specific surface energy.

Given:
Young's modulus (E) = 60 GPa = 60 * 10^9 Pa
Specific surface energy (cs) = 0.5 J.m⁻² = 0.5 * 10⁶ J.m⁻²

Substituting these values into the equation for Gc:

Gc = 20/C2103 * 0.5 * 10⁶ J.m⁻²
Gc = 5.27 * 10⁶ J.m⁻¹

We need to find the value of ε that corresponds to the maximum strain per pass.

First, let's find the maximum reduction per pass, rmax, using the power law relationship between strain and reduction:

rmax = 1 / (C0)^(1 / (n + 1))

where C0 is a material constant and n is the strain-hardening exponent. In this case, n = 0.3.

First, let's calculate the stress range Δσ:

Δσ = σ(max) - σ(min) = 200 MPa

Next, we'll calculate the value of ΔK using the given equation:

da/dN = $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$

We want to find ΔK, so we'll rearrange the equation:

$ΔK = (da/dN)^{1/3}$

Now, we'll substitute the given value of da/dN and calculate ΔK:

$ΔK = (10^(-12) \times (ΔK)^3)^{1/3}$

$ΔK = 10^(-4) \times ΔK^3$

$ΔK^3 - 10^(-4) \times ΔK^3 = 0$

$ΔK^3 = 10^(-4) \times ΔK^3$

$ΔK = 10^(-4/3) \approx 0.01442 MPa.m^{1/2}$

a = a0 + N × da/dN

a = 0.001 m + 1,000,000 × $10.000000001442 \times (ΔK)^3$

a = 0.001 m + 1,000,000 × $1.442 \times 10^{-11} \times (0.01442)^3$

Schmid's law states that slip begins in a single crystal when the shear stress resolved on the slip plane in the slip direction reaches the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS).

First, we need to find the CRSS for the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system. From the context, we know that the CRSS for the primary slip system in aluminium is 4218 MPa.

Next, we need to find the orientation factor m, which relates the applied tensile stress a to the shear stress.

where W is the work done, p is the pressure, and dA is the change in area. Since the flow stress is constant, we can find the work done by integrating the pressure over the change in area.

First, we need to find the initial and final areas of the billet:

Initial area: A0 = πd1² = π(0.02)² = 0.001257 m²
Final area: A = πd2² = π(0.016)² = 0.000364 m²

Now, we can calculate the work done:

W = ∫∫40MPa(πd²)d(πd²)

Integrating this expression, we get:

W = 40MPa∫∫π²d³dd

Using the substitution u = d², we have du = 2dd, so:

W = 40MPa∫∫(1/2)π³du

Integrating, we get:

Substituting the initial diameter:

W = (40MPa * 1/3 * π³ * (0.02)²) = 0.002511 J

$K_1 = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a_0}$

where $K_1 = K_(1c) = 30 \text{ MPa} m^{(1/2)}$ is the fracture toughness and $\sigma$ is the maximum allowed tensile stress.

$\sigma = \dfrac{K_1}{1.1 \sqrt{\pi a_0}}$

Substituting the given value of $K_1$, we get:

$\sigma = \dfrac{30 \text{ MPa} m^{(1/2)}}{1.1 \sqrt{\pi a_0}}$

To find the critical crack size $a_0$, we can solve for it:

Assuming the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is"," To find the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected in the vulcanization of 50 g of natural rubber with 10 g of sulfur, we first need to determine the number of sulfur atoms that can react with the rubber.

Given:
- Mass of natural rubber = 50 g
- Mass of sulfur = 10 g
- Atomic weight of sulfur = 32 amu
- Molecular weight of a mer unit of natural rubber = 68 amu

First, we need to find the number of mers in 50 g of natural rubber:

Molecular weight of natural rubber = Number of mers × Molecular weight of a mer
50 g = n × 68 g/mol
n = 50 g / 68 g/mol = 0.7351 × 10^2 moles

Next, we need to find the number of sulfur atoms that can react with the rubber:

Mass of sulfur = Mass of sulfur atoms × Atomic weight of sulfur
10 g = n' × 32 amu
n' = 10 g / 32 amu = 0.3125 × 10^2 moles

Since we assume a 1:1 mer to S ratio, the number of cross-linked sites that could be formed is equal to the number of sulfur atoms:

Maximum number of cross-linked sites = 0.3125 × 10^2

To find the percentage of cross-linked sites, we divide the number of cross-linked sites by the total number of mers and multiply by 100%:

Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites = (Number of cross-linked sites / Total number of mers) × 100%
= (0.3125 × 10^2 / 0.7351 × 10^2) × 100%

Atomic percentage = (Weight percentage / Atomic weight) × 100%

Given: Weight percentage of carbon (C) = 6%
Atomic weight of carbon (C) = 12 g/mol
Atomic weight of iron (Fe) = 56 g/mol

First, we need to calculate the weight percentage of iron:

Weight percentage of iron = 100% - Weight percentage of carbon
Weight percentage of iron = 100% - 6%
Weight percentage of iron = 94%

Now, we can calculate the atomic percentage of carbon:

Atomic percentage of carbon = (Weight percentage of carbon / Atomic weight of carbon) × 100%
Atomic percentage of carbon = (6% / 12 g/mol) × 100%
Atomic percentage of carbon = 0.5% × 100%

Explanation:

Solid state sintering (P) is a process where the particles in a powder compact are bonded together without melting them. It is typically used for ceramics and refractory materials.

Liquid phase sintering (Q) is a process where a liquid phase is formed during sintering, which helps to wet the particles and promote bonding. It is commonly used for metals and some ceramics.

Spark plasma sintering (R) is a type of consolidation process that uses a high voltage electric discharge to heat and compress a powder compact. It is often used for the production of advanced ceramics and composites.

Laser sintering (S) is a process where a laser beam is used to selectively melt and fuse powder particles together to form a solid part. It is commonly used for the production of 3D printed parts, particularly in the field of additive manufacturing.

Based on this information, the most suitable products for each sintering process are:

1. Carbon nanotube products: Spark plasma sintering (R) is often used for the production of carbon nanotube composites due to its ability to consolidate the nanotubes at high temperatures and pressures without damaging them.
2. Mixture of Cu and Zn powder products: Liquid phase sintering (Q) is commonly used for the production of copper-zinc alloys, as the liquid phase formed during sintering helps to wet the particles and promote bonding.
3. Iron powder products: Solid state sintering (P) is the most suitable process for the production of iron powder products, as it allows for the particles to be bonded together without melting them.
4. 3D printed products: Laser sintering (S) is the most suitable process for the production of 3D printed products, as it allows for the selective melting and bonding of powder particles to form a solid part layer by layer.",,,0,

(A) Increase in the gap between solidus and liquidus lines (B) Increase in the solubility of impurities in solid as compared to that in liquid phase (C) Agitation of melt (D) Low cooling rate of melt,"C) Agitation of melt

Explanation: In zone refining, the impurities are selectively enriched at the end of the molten zone, and the purer material is obtained at the other end. The separation of impurities depends on the difference in solubility between the solid and liquid phases, and the temperature gradient.

(C)	Statement-1 is TRUE but Statement -2 is FALSE.  (D)	Statement-1 is FALSE but Statement-2 is TRUE. ," (C) Statement-1 is TRUE but Statement-2 is FALSE.

Explanation:
Statement-1 is true because sintering in a vacuum reduces the risk of atmospheric contamination or undesirable chemical reactions that can hinder the densification process. This allows for more effective mass transport mechanisms and faster densification.

Statement-2 is false because closed pores formed during sintering do not necessarily inhibit full densification. In fact, they can contribute to densification by acting as sinks for the diffusing species during the sintering process. However, if the closed pores are too large or not evenly distributed, they can hinder densification by limiting the connectivity of the densifying material.",,,0,

The smallest integer value of ‘n’ such that P(n) ≤ ½ is? (round off to the nearest integer) ","To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½, we need to calculate the probability of no accidents in 'n' months. Since the probability of an accident in one month is 1/100, the probability of no accident in one month is 99/100.

Using the property of independent events, the probability of no accidents in 'n' months is:

P(n) = (Probability of no accident in one month) ^ n
= (99/100) ^ n

To find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½, we need to find the value of 'n'n' such that (99/100) ^ n ≤ ½.

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, we get:

n * log10(99/100) ≤ log10(1/2)

Using a calculator, we find that log10(1/2) ≈ -0.301.

(round off to 2 decimal places) ","To find the required side of the cubic green compact, we first need to determine the volume of the porosity in the green compact and the volume of the solid ceramic in the sintered cube.

1. Volume of porosity in the green compact:
Porosity = 18% = 0.18
Volume of porosity = (0.18) × (Volume of the green compact)

2. Volume of solid ceramic in the sintered cube:
Theoretical density of ceramic = 6.76 g/cm³
Sintered density of ceramic = 6.60 g/cm³

The context provided mentions that heat flows from the liquid (inside) through the composite walls to the environment (outside). This implies that there are thermal resistances to heat transfer in the liquid and air, as well as in the solid phases (the sand mold). Therefore, there is a coupled convection–conduction mechanism taking place prior to pouring the melt into the mold cavity.

Let $w\_(CaO)$, $w\_(MgO)$, $w\_(Al\_2O\_3)$, and $w\_(SiO\_2)$ be the weight percentages of CaO, MgO, Al2O3, and SiO2, respectively. Then, we have:

$$w\_(CaO) = 0.55 \times 0.40 = 0.22$$
$$w\_(MgO) = 0.10 \times 0.24 = 0.024$$
$$w\_(Al\_2O\_3) = 0.15 \times 0.27 = 0.0405$$
$$w\_(SiO\_2) = 0.20 \times 0.28 = 0.056$$

Now, we can calculate the mole fractions $X\_(CaO)$, $X\_(MgO)$, $X\_(Al\_2O\_3)$, and $X\_(SiO\_2)$:

$$X\_(CaO) = \frac{w\_(CaO)}{\sum w\_i} = \frac{0.22}{0.22 + 0.024 + 0.0405 + 0.056} = 0.31$$

$$X\_(SiO\_2) = \frac{w\_(SiO\_2)}{\sum w\_i} = \frac{0.056}{0.22 + 0.024 + 0.0405 + 0.056} = 0.21$$

Explanation:

Oil quenching (P) is the least severe quenching method as it involves quenching a hot oil or other non-aqueous fluid with a cooler fluid or gas.

Water quenching (Q) is a more severe quenching method as it involves quenching a hot fluid with water. Water has a higher heat capacity than oil, so it can absorb more heat and cool the fluid more effectively.

Water quenching with agitation (R) is even more severe as it involves agitating the water during the quenching process. Agitation increases the surface area of the water in contact with the hot fluid, allowing for more efficient heat transfer and faster cooling.

Brine quenching (S) is the most severe quenching method as it involves quenching a hot fluid with a brine solution, which has a much higher thermal conductivity than water.

B = (s(t))^2 / t
B = (3 cm)^2 / (2 min)

1. Calculate the mass of Fe in 1 kg of hot metal:
Hot metal = 95% Fe, so the mass of Fe in 1 kg of hot metal is 0.95 kg.

2. Calculate the mass of Fe in the iron ore:
Iron ore = ≡ 95% Fe2O3, so the mass of Fe in 1 kg of iron ore is 0.95 kg / (Fe2O3 → 2 Fe + 3 O2, where Fe = 56 g/mol and Fe2O3 = 160 g/mol) = 0.95 kg / (160 g/mol / 56 g/mol)² = 1.68 kg.

3. Calculate the mass of gangue in the iron ore:
Since the iron ore contains 95% Fe2O3, it contains 5% gangue. The mass of gangue in 1 kg of iron ore is 0.05 kg.

4. Calculate the mass of iron ore required to produce 1 kg of hot metal:
Mass of iron ore = Mass of Fe in hot metal / (Mass of Fe in iron ore / Mass of iron ore) = 0.95 kg / (1.68 kg / kg) = 0.56 kg.

- casting speed ($U\_c$) = 0.2 $m.s^(-1)$

We are given the mould heat flux ($q\_m$) as a function of distance below the meniscus (z):

$$q\_m(z) = [2.67 - 0.33(z/U\_c)^{0.5}] * 10^6$$

To find the average mould flux, we need to calculate the mould flux at the minimum and maximum distances below the meniscus and then find the average value.

Let's assume the minimum distance is at the meniscus ($z$ = 0) and the maximum distance is at the bottom of the mould ($z$ = $L\_m$).

At the meniscus ($z$ = 0):
$$q\_m(0) = [2.67 - 0.33(0/0.2)^{0.5}] * 10^6 = 2.67 * 10^6 \text{ W/m}^2$$

At the bottom of the mould ($z$ = $L\_m$):

Neglecting material losses, the yield of Fe (in %) is?"," To find the yield of Fe in BOF steelmaking, we first need to determine the mass of CaO and FeO in the slag. Then, we can calculate the mass of Fe in the hot metal based on the given mass of Fe in the hot metal and the yield of Fe.

1. Calculate the mass of CaO and FeO in the slag:

The mass of CaO in the lime used is 5 metric ton x 90 wt.% = 4.5 metric ton.
The mass of CaO in the slag is 40 wt.% x 100 metric ton = 40 metric ton.

The difference between the mass of CaO in the lime and the mass of CaO in the slag represents the mass of CaO that has reacted with FeO to form FeO and other compounds.

Mass of CaO reacted = 4.5 metric ton - 4.0 metric ton = 0.5 metric ton

The mass of FeO in the slag is 22 wt.% x 100 metric ton = 22 metric ton.

2. Calculate the mass of Fe in the hot metal:

The mass of Fe in the hot metal is 100 metric ton x 93.2 wt.% = 93.2 metric ton.

3. Determine the yield of Fe:

The total mass of CaO and FeO in the slag is 40 metric ton + 22 metric ton = 62 metric ton.

The mass of Fe that has reacted with CaO to form FeO and other compounds is equal to the mass of CaO that has reacted.

Mass of Fe reacted = 0.5 metric ton

The mass of Fe in the steel is the initial mass of Fe in the hot metal minus the mass of Fe that has reacted.

Mass of Fe in the steel = 93.2 metric ton - 0.5 metric ton = 92.7 metric ton

The yield of Fe is the mass of Fe in the steel divided by the initial mass of Fe in the hot metal.

First, let's calculate the value of the equilibrium constant at the given temperature:

T = 1600° C + 273.15 = 1873.15 K

log K = (1160/T) + 2.003
log K = (1160/1873.15) + 2.003
log K ≈ 2.551

Now, we can use the equation for the activity product:

K = hC(wt.%C) × hO(wt.%O)

Since the activity coefficients for both O and C are assumed to be unity, we have:

K = (wt.%C) × (wt.%O)

We want to find the dissolved oxygen content (wt.%O), so we can rearrange the equation:

wt.%O = K / (wt.%C)

Substituting the value of K and wt.%C, we get:

wt.%O = 2.551 / 0.007
wt.%O ≈ 364.43 wt.%

When the partial pressure of CO ($𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$) is 1 atm, K = 0.002. If $𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$ = 0.1 atm, what is the value of K, at the same temperature? Note: Assume Henry’s law is applicable.  (A) 0.06 (B) 0.002 (C) 0.02 (D) 0.0002"," To solve this problem, we can use Henry's law, which relates the partial pressure of a gas in a solution to the concentration of that gas. Henry's law states that the partial pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the mole fraction of that gas in the solution.

First, we need to find the mole fraction of dissolved oxygen in terms of the weight percentages of carbon and oxygen. We can set up a ratio of the weight percentages and use the given relation:

(wt.%C) / (wt.%O) = K

Let xC be the mole fraction of carbon and xO be the mole fraction of oxygen. We have:

xC = wt.%C / 100
xO = wt.%O / 100

From the given relation, we have:

xC / xO = K

Now, we can use Henry's law to relate the partial pressures of CO to the mole fractions of oxygen in the solution. The solubility of CO in the steel bath can be expressed as:

$p_{CO} = H * xO$

where H is the Henry's law constant.

When $p_{CO}$ is 1 atm, we have:

1 atm = H * xO (when K = 0.002)

Solving for xO, we get:

xO = 1 atm / H = 0.002

Now, when $p_{CO}$ is 0.1 atm, we have:

0.1 atm = H * xO (when we want to find K)

Solving for xO, we get:

xO = 0.1 atm / H = 0.001

Using the given relation xC / xO = K, we can find K:

xC / 0.001 = K

Solving for K, we get:

K = xC / 0.001

Since xC = wt.%C / 100, we have:

K = (wt.%C) / (0.001 * 100)

Therefore, the answer is (wt.%C) / 0.001 = 1000 * (wt.%C) = 1000wt.%C.

To make this answer dimensionally consistent with the given options, we need to divide by 100 to get the weight percent. So, the final answer is 1000 * (wt.%C) / 100 = 10,000 * (wt.%C).

Comparing this to the given options, the closest answer is 10,000 * 0.002 = 20. So, the answer is not among the given options.

The given options are oxides of aluminum, iron, silicon, and magnesium.

The context mentions that silica (SiO2) reacts rapidly with ferric oxide (Fe2O3) to form fayalite, which has a lower melting point and helps collect unwanted impurities. However, it also states that silica has a surprising tolerance for basic CaO-rich slags due to the existence of a monotectic plateau at its silica-rich end in the SiO2-CaO diagram. This feature accounts for the slower rate of attack by molten basic slag and the feasibility of using lime as a bonding agent for silica grains during firing.

The quenching power of a quenchant is a measure of its ability to remove heat from the material being quenched. The higher the quenching power, the faster the cooling rate.

Water has the highest quenching power due to its high specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Brine, which is a solution of salt in water, has a higher quenching power than oil due to its higher thermal conductivity. Oil has a lower quenching power than water or brine due to its lower thermal conductivity. Air has the lowest quenching power as it is a gas and does not conduct heat as effectively as liquids.

* Electric Heating (Q) is a heat transfer process that can be used in various unit operations, such as heating a charge material in a furnace or melting a material in a furnace or a vessel. It is often used in the Metallurgical Industry, particularly in the Steel Industry, to heat materials to high temperatures.

The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5%C.

First, let's find the weight of iron ore required to produce one ton of hot metal. We know that the iron ore contains 80% Fe2O3 and 20% gangue materials. The weight of Fe2O3 in one ton of hot metal is 95.5 kg, so the weight of Fe2O3 in the iron ore is:

95.5 kg * (1 ton / x) = 95.5 / x kg

where x is the weight of the iron ore in kg required to produce one ton of hot metal.

We also know that the coke contains 85% C and 15% ash, and 600 kg of coke is used per ton of hot metal. The weight of C in one ton of hot metal is 4.5 kg, so the weight of C in the coke is:

4.5 kg * (1 ton / x) = 4.5 / x kg

The weight of the iron ore and gangue materials in the iron ore is (1 - 0.8) * 95.5 / x = 15.5 / x kg. Since the weight of the gangue materials and the ash in the coke form slag, the weight of the slag produced is the sum of the weights of the gangue materials in the iron ore and the ash in the coke:

(15.5 / x) + (15 / 85 * 600 / x)

Now we can find the values of options A, B, C, and D by calculating the weights of iron ore and slag for each option and comparing them to the given values.

Option A: 1705 kg iron ore, 431 kg slag

x = 1705 kg / 1 ton

95.5 / x = 56.3 kg Fe2O3
15.5 / x = 10.3 kg gangue materials
15 / 85 * 600 / x = 112.5 kg ash

Total weight of iron ore = 56.3 + 10.3 = 66.6 kg/kg of hot metal
Total weight of slag = 112.5 kg/kg of hot metal

The given values are not close to 66.6 and 112.5, so option A is not correct.

Option B: 2131kg, 546 kg

x = 2131 kg / 1 ton

95.5 / x = 45.8 kg Fe2O3
15.5 / x = 7.3 kg gangue materials
15 / 85 * 600 / x = 111.1 kg ash

Total weight of iron ore = 45.8 + 7.3 = 53.1 kg/kg of hot metal
Total weight of slag = 111.1 kg/kg of hot metal

The given values are not close to 53.1 and 111.1, so option B is not correct.

Option C: 1705kg, 331kg

x = 1705 kg / 1 ton

95.5 / x = 56.3 kg Fe2O3
15.5 / x = 10.3 kg gangue materials
15 / 85 * 600 / x = 112.5 kg ash

Total weight of iron ore = 56.3 + 10.3 = 66.6 kg/kg of hot metal
Total weight of slag = 112.5 kg/kg of hot metal

The given values are not close to 66.6 and 112.5, so option C is not correct.

Option D: 1500kg, 431kg

x = 1500 kg / 1 ton

95.5 / x = 63.6 kg Fe2O3

The context provided mentions that during the secondary refining, the desulfurization reaction occurs between the steel and the slag, as expressed in Eq. (1). At the steel-slag interface, the sulfur reallocates according to the thermodynamic equilibrium.

Explanation: In brazing, the molten filler alloy needs to wet the base metal and the ceramic surface to form a strong joint. A high surface tension of the molten filler alloy helps in promoting capillary action, which aids in the wetting and spreading of the filler alloy over the base metal and ceramic surfaces. This results in a good quality brazed joint.

Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. The other options (A, B, and D) are not directly related to the requirement for good quality brazing. A low contact angle with the base metal (option A) is desirable for good wetting, but it is not the same as having a high surface tension. A low density (option B) and high viscosity (option D) of the molten filler alloy can make the brazing process more difficult and may result in porosity or incomplete wetting of the joint.",,,0,

However, we can infer some information from the context that may help us answer the question.

The context mentions that both SO2 and O2 are always present in the roaster. This suggests that oxidation reactions may occur during roasting, leading to the formation of oxide phases.

The possible solid phases mentioned in the question are M (the metal), MS (sulfide), MO (oxide), and MSO4 (sulfate). According to the phase rule, the number of phases that can co-exist at equilibrium in a system depends on the number of components (C), the number of degrees of freedom (F), and the number of phases (P). In this case, we have C = 3 (M, S, O), F = 3 (solid, liquid, gas), and P = 4 (M, MS, MO, MSO4). However, according to the phase rule, a system with three components and three degrees of freedom can only have a maximum of two phases at equilibrium.

Therefore, it is not possible for all four solid phases (M, MS, MO, MSO4) to co-exist at thermodynamic equilibrium in the roaster.

Based on this information, the answer is (D) M, MSO4. However, it is important to note that this answer is based on the assumption that the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium, which may not always be the case in practice.

To prevent aspiration of molten metal, the maximum cross-section area (in $m^2$) at the base of the sprue is?","To prevent aspiration of molten metal, the pressure at the base of the sprue must be equal to the atmospheric pressure. Using the continuity principle, we can find the minimum cross-sectional area of the sprue at its base (A3) in terms of the area at the top (A2) and the height of the sprue (h):

A2 = A3 × (h / h')

where h' is the height of the melt column at the base of the sprue. To maintain a melt flow rate of 4 m³/s, we can find the velocity of the melt at the top of the sprue using the given cross-sectional area:

v2 = Q / A2 = 4 m³/s / 2.2 m² = 1.818 m/s

The velocity of the melt at the base of the sprue can be found using Bernoulli's equation:

v3 = √(2gh / (h' - h))

where g is the acceleration due to gravity, h is the height of the sprue, and h' is the height of the melt column at the base of the sprue. We want to find the minimum value of h' that satisfies the condition v3 = 0 (no aspiration):

0 = √(2gh / (h' - h))

h' = h + v3² × (h / g)

Substituting the given values:

h' = 0.25 m + (1.818 m/s)² × (.25 m / 9.81 m/s²)
h' = 0.26 m

Now we can find the minimum cross-sectional area of the sprue at its base:

A3 = A2 × (h / h') = 2.2 m² × (.25 m / .26 m) = 2.15 m²

First, let's find the volume (V) and surface area (A) of the cylindrical bloom:

Volume = πr²h = π(375 mm)²(1000 mm) = 45,187,500 mm³
Surface area = 2πrh + πr² = 2π(375 mm)(1000 mm) + π(375 mm)² = 11,309,765.6 mm²

Now, let's find the casting modulus (Mc):

Mc = V/A = 45,187,500 mm³ / 11,309,765.6 mm² = 3.99 × 10³ mm²

Using Chvorinov's rule, the solidification time (tc) is given by:

(answer up to three decimal places)","To find the concentration of carbon in steel at t = 1 min, we need to use the given rate equation and the initial condition.

First, we need to convert the given concentrations from weight percent to mol/cm³ for consistency with the given diffusion coefficient equation.

Given: c(t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.% = 0.0032 mol/cm³ (assuming a mass density of 7.87 g/cm³ and atomic weight of carbon as 12 g/mol)
c* = 0.04 wt.% = 0.00032 mol/cm³

Now, we can use the given rate equation:

dC/dt = -(c - c*)

We want to find c at t = 1 min. We can use the initial condition to find the value of c at t = 0 min and then integrate the rate equation to find the value of c at t = 1 min.

Let's find the value of c at t = 0 min:

c(t = 0 min) = 0.0032 mol/cm³

Now, we can integrate the rate equation:

∫(dC/dt) dt = ∫(-(c - c*)) dt

Let u = c - c*, then du = dc and dt is just dt, so we have:


∫du = ∫(-u) dt

Integrating both sides, we get:

u(t) = u(0) - ∫(-u) dt

Substituting u(0) = c(t = 0 min) = 0.0032 mol/cm³ and u(t) = c(t) - c* = c(t) - 0.00032 mol/cm³, we get:

c(t) = 0.0032 mol/cm³ - ∫(-(c(t) - 0.00032)) dt

Integrating both sides, we get:

c(t) = 0.0032 mol/cm³ + ∫(c(t)) dt

Now, we can use the initial condition to find the value of the integral on the right-hand side:

∫(c(t)) dt from 0 to 1 min = c(1 min) - c(0 min) = 0.0032 mol/cm³ - 0.0032 mol/cm³ = 0 mol/cm³

So, we have:

c(t) = 0.0032 mol/cm³ + 0 = 0.0032 mol/cm³

Now, we need to convert this back to weight percent:

c(t) = 0.0032 mol/cm³ × (12 g/mol) / (7.87 g/cm³) = 0.0043 wt.%

Therefore, the concentration of carbon in steel at t = 1 min is approximately 0.0043 wt.%.

(answer up tp two decimal places) ","To find the height of the riser, we can use Chvorinov's's rule and the given information. First, we need to find the casting modulus (Mc) and the riser modulus (Mr). Since the casting and riser have the same material, their densities and specific heats are the same. The volume and surface area of the casting and riser are different, so we can calculate their moduli as follows:

Casting:
Vc = 5.0 cm * 5.0 cm * 5.0 cm = 125 cm³
Ac = 2 * (5.0 cm * 5.0 cm) * 6 = 90 cm²
Mc = Vc / Ac = 125 cm³ / 90 cm² = 1.39 cm⁻¹

Riser:
Vr = π/4 * (0.5 cm)² * 3.2 cm² = 0.636 cm³
Ar = π * (0.5 cm) * 3.2 cm = 3.14 cm²
Mr = Vr / Ar = 0.636 cm³ / 3.14 cm² = 0.203 cm⁻¹

Now, we can use Chvorinov's rule to find the height of the riser (hr):

tr = BrM²r = 0.203 cm⁻¹ * (3.2 min)² = 3.11 cm²
hr = (tr / Mc)² = (3.11 cm² / 1.39 cm⁻¹)² = 12.5 cm

where A1 = h1 / C0h2 θmax, h1 = 4R, h1sin²θ = Dh², and h1sin²tanθ/C01l = 2.

First, we need to find the value of Dh:

Dh = 4Rp

where p is the mean specific pressure, which can be calculated using the given coefficient of friction (μ) and the plane-strain yield stress (σy) of the nickel alloy:

p = σy / (1 - μ²)

Now, we can find the value of Dh:

Dh = 4 * (450 mm) * (500 MPa / (1 - 0.1²))
Dh = 1,866,667 N/mm²

Next, we can find the value of h1:

h1 = Dh / (4 * sin²θ)
h1 = 1,866,667 N/mm² / (4 * sin²(10°))
h1 = 2,311,111 mm²

Now, we can find the value of A1:

A1 = h1 / (C0 * h2 * θmax)
h2 = 250 mm
θmax = 180° - 2 * 10° = 160°
A1 = 2,311,111 mm² / (0.6 * 250 mm * 160°)
A1 = 1,111,111 mm³/mm

Finally, we can find the maximum possible reduction:

rmax = A1 / C0A2 θmax
rmax = 1,111,111 mm³/mm / (0.6 * (250 mm)² * 160°)
rmax = 1,111,111 mm³/mm / 1,550,625 mm²
rmax = 0.718 mm

* Q. Extrusion: This process is not directly mentioned in the context, so it is difficult to determine which type of crack is associated with it.

First, we need to find the oxygen partial pressure in the gas mixture. The total pressure is 1 atm, and the volume fractions of argon and oxygen are 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. Therefore, the partial pressures of argon and oxygen are:

pAr = 0.6 × 1 atm = 0.6 atm
pO2 = 0.4 × 1 atm = 0.4 atm

Now, we can calculate the oxygen mole fraction, xO2, and the oxygen partial pressure using the ideal gas law:

xO2 = VO2 / (VO2 + VAr) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.6) = 0.4 / 1 = 0.4

pO2 = xO2 × pTotal = 0.4 × 1 atm = 0.4 atm

Next, we can calculate the oxygen molar density, ρmO2, using the ideal gas law:

ρmO2 = pO2 / (RT × 1 atm) = 0.4 atm / (8.205 × 10^(-5) Pa⋅m^3/mol⋅K × 1 atm) = 0.0532 mol/m^3

Now, we can calculate the oxygen flux, J, using the mass transfer coefficient and the Schmidt number (assuming laminar flow):

Sc = μ/D = 0.03 Pa⋅s / (1.8 × 10^(-5) m^2/s) = 17.22

J = Sh × ρmO2 × D × Sc^(-1/3) × (r/2)

where Sh is the Sherwood number, which can be calculated using the dimensionless grouping:

Sh = 2 × (Re−Sc)^(1/3)

Re = ρ × v^2 × r / μ = 0.0532 mol/m^3 × (3 × 10^(-3) m/s)^2 × 0.025 m / 0.03 Pa⋅s = 111.5

Sh = 2 × (11.5−17.22)^(1/3) = 2.25

Next, we can use Henry's law to find the partial pressures of carbon and oxygen in the steel at the given temperature and dissolved concentrations:

For carbon:
ln aC = ln(γC × [C]) = ln(0.77 × 0.03) = -0.412
aC = exp(-0.412) = 0.635
pC = aC × Ptotal = 0.635 × 1 atm = 0.635 atm

For oxygen:
ln aO = ln(γO × [O]) = ln(1.18 × 0.03) = 0.085
aO = exp(0.085) = 1.089
pO = aO × Ptotal = 1.089 × 1 atm = 1.089 atm

Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the partial pressures of carbon and oxygen in the gas phase must be equal to their Henry's law values:

pC = pO = xCO × Ptotal

We can use this equation to find the mole fraction of CO in the gas phase (xCO):

xCO = pC / Ptotal = 0.635 atm / (1 atm + 0.635 atm + 1.08.314×1800×(0.03 wt.% × 55.55 g/mol + 0.03 wt.% × 31.99 g/mol)) = 0.011

Finally, we can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of CO in the gas phase (nCO):

nCO = Ptotal × Vtotal / (RT) × xCO = (1 atm × 1 m3) / (8.314 J.mol^(-1).K^(-1) × 1800 K) × 0.011 = 0.00017 mol

Since the stoichiometric ratio of carbon to oxygen in the reaction is 1:1, we can find the number of moles of carbon in the steel (nC) by using the number of moles of oxygen (nO) and the given dissolved oxygen content:

nO = (0.03 wt.% × 100%) × (mass of steel) / (molar mass of oxygen) = (0.03 × 1) × (mass of steel) / (31.99 g/mol)
nC = nO

We can then find the mass of carbon in the steel:

mass of carbon = nC × molar mass of carbon = (nO) × molar mass of carbon = (nO) × 12.01 g/mol

Rounding off to two decimal places, the answer is:

mass of carbon = (0.00017 mol) × (12.01 g/mol) = 0.00204 g or 0.0020 kg.",,,0,

If solidification time is 60 minutes in the spherical casting, the time(in minutes) required to solidify in the cubical casting is?(round off to nearest integer)"," To solve this problem, we can use Chvorinov's rule, which states that the solidification time is proportional to the square of the casting's characteristic length. The characteristic length for a sphere is its radius, and for a cube, it is half the edge length.

Given:
Solidification time for spherical casting = 60 minutes
Radius of spherical casting = 6 cm
Edge length of cubical casting = 12 cm

Using Chvorinov's rule, we have:

t_sphere = B * (sphere radius)^2
t_cube = B * (cube edge length/2)^2

Where B is the Chvorinov constant, which is given as 6.75 min/cm^2 in the text.

First, let's find the solidification time for the cubical casting:

t_cube = B * (cube edge length/2)^2
t_cube = 6.75 min/cm^2 * (12 cm/2)^2
t_cube = 6.75 min/cm^2 * 144 cm^2
t_cube = 969.6 min

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is 970 minutes.

εy = ln(h0/ho)

where h0 is the initial height and ho is the final height after deformation. In this case, h0 = 100 mm and ho = 40 mm for a 60% height reduction.

Substituting the values, we get:

εy = ln(100/40) = ln(2.5) ≈ 0.916

Since this is the true strain in the y-direction (height direction), the true strain for 60% height reduction in hot forging is approximately 0.92 (rounded off to two decimal places).",,,0,

(A) High top pressure (B) Bell-less top (C) Pulverized coal injection (D) Rotating chute for burden distribution ,"The given context does not provide information about the modern practice used for retarding the solution loss reaction in blast furnace ironmaking. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question directly based on the context. However, based on the keywords provided, it can be inferred that the practices mentioned in the question are related to the blast furnace process. The solution loss reaction is a reaction between the molten iron and the impurities present in the blast furnace, which can lead to the formation of unwanted slag and the loss of valuable iron. Retarding this reaction can help improve the efficiency and productivity of the blast furnace.

One modern practice used for retarding the solution loss reaction in blast furnace ironmaking is the injection of lime or limestone into the furnace. This practice is known as lime or limestone injection, and it is used to increase the pH value of the molten iron bath, which in turn reduces the solubility of impurities and prevents their reaction with the molten iron. This practice can help reduce the amount of slag formed and improve the quality of the iron produced.

Therefore, while the context does not directly answer the question, it does provide some background information on the blast furnace process and the importance of retarding the solution loss reaction. Based on this information, it can be inferred that option C (pulverized coal injection) is not the correct answer, as it is not mentioned in the context as being used for retarding the solution loss reaction. The other options (high top pressure, bell-less top, and rotating chute for burden distribution) are also not directly related to this practice.

If the sulfur content in the steel is reduced from 0.015 mass% to 0.0025 mass%, the desulfurizing index is? (round off to the nearest integer).","To calculate the desulfurizing index, we first need to determine the amount of sulfur removed from the steel. The initial sulfur content is 0.015 mass%, and the final sulfur content is 0.0025 mass%. The mass of sulfur removed is:

(Initial sulfur content * Initial mass) - (Final sulfur content * Final mass)
= (0.0015 * 100000) - (0.000025 * 101250)

(A) 0.14 (B) 0.30 (C) 0.70 (D) 0.86,"To determine the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, we first need to find the number of moles of each monomer unit.

The mer unit for vinyl chloride is C2H3Cl, and its molecular weight is:
Mo(vinyl chloride) = (1 × C) + (2 × H) + (1 × Cl) = 54.51 g/mol

The mer unit for vinyl acetate is C2H3OAc, and its molecular weight is:
Mo(vinyl acetate) = (1 × C) + (2 × H) + (1 × O) + (1 × C) + (2 × H) + (1 × O) + (1 × C) + (2 × H) + (1 × Cl) = 102.09 g/mol

The degree of polymerization (DP) is the number of monomer units in the polymer chain. In this case, DP = 160.

Now, we can calculate the number of moles of each monomer unit:

Moles of vinyl chloride = DP × Moles of vinyl chloride per mer unit
= 160 × (1/Mo(vinyl chloride))
= 160 × (1/54.51)

The total number of moles in the copolymer is the sum of the moles of each monomer:

Total moles = Moles of vinyl chloride + Moles of vinyl acetate

The mole fraction of vinyl chloride is the number of moles of vinyl chloride divided by the total number of moles:

So, the mole fraction of vinyl chloride is 1 - mole fraction of vinyl acetate = 1 - 0.35 = ≈ 0.65.

First, let's calculate the total number of atoms in one unit cell. Each ethylene repeat unit consists of 2 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms. So, two ethylene repeat units contain:

2 * (2C + 4H) = 2 * (2 * 12.01 g/mol + 4 * 1.008 g/mol) = 2 * 28.052 g/mol = 56.104 g/mol

Material Applications,20,G-XEC-2018-15,NUM,56,(Given: Density of water = 1.00 g $cm^(-3)$). A sintered sample was weighed in air and water using an analytical balance. The mass of the sample in air is 2.67 g and its apparent mass in water is 1.67 g. Calculate the density of the sample in g $cm^(-3)$ (give answer up to 2 decimal places),"To calculate the density of the sample, we first need to find its true mass by subtracting the mass of the water displaced when it is in water from its mass in air.

Apparent mass in water = mass in air - mass of water displaced

We know that the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the sample. Since the volume of 1 g of water is 1 cm³, we can find the volume of the sample by dividing its mass in air by the density of water.

Volume of sample = mass in air / density of water

Now, we can find the mass of water displaced by the sample in water and calculate the true mass of the sample.

True mass = mass in air - mass of water displaced

Mass of water displaced = volume of sample × density of water

Finally, we can calculate the density of the sample by dividing its true mass by its volume.

Density = true mass / volume of sample

Let's calculate the values step by step:

1. Volume of sample = mass in air / density of water
Volume of sample = 2.67 g / 1.00 g $cm^(-3)$
Volume of sample = 2.67 cm³
2. Mass of water displaced = volume of sample × density of water
Mass of water displaced = 2.67 cm³ × 1.00 g $cm^(-3)$
Mass of water displaced = 2.67 g
3. True mass = mass in air - mass of water displaced
True mass = 2.67 g - 2.67 g
True mass = 0 g

However, we made an error in calculating the true mass. The true mass should be the difference between the mass in air and the mass of the water displaced, which is 1.00 g in this case.

True mass = mass in air - mass of water displaced
True mass = 2.67 g - 1.67 g
True mass = 1.00 g

4. Density = true mass / volume of sample
Density = 1.00 g / 2.67 cm³
Density = 0.375 g $cm^(-3)$

So, the density of the sample is approximately 0.38 g $cm^(-3)$.",,,0,

(C) Silica has a significantly lower melting point than magnesia.

Explanation:

The context provided mentions that silica bricks are used for self-supporting arches in furnace roofs, while magnesia bricks cannot be used for this purpose. The reason given in the text is that silica has a relatively low theoretical density and is resistant to creep at elevated temperatures, allowing it to be used for extended durations at temperatures approaching the melting point. In contrast, the use of magnesia bricks has decreased in the glass industry due to alkali-induced corrosion in oxy-fuel fired glass hearths.

(C) addition of plasticizers. (D) annealing"," The correct answer is (B) increasing the cross-link density.

Explanation:

The context provided discusses several studies on the creep behavior of various materials, including polymers such as epoxies. The text mentions that the creep resistance of polymers can be increased by adding ceramic particles and fibers, which is consistent with the general understanding that reinforcing materials can enhance the creep resistance of polymers. However, the specific mechanism for how this enhancement occurs is not explicitly stated in the context.

One possible explanation for how adding reinforcements can increase the creep resistance of polymers is by increasing the cross-link density. Cross-linking is a chemical reaction that forms covalent bonds between polymer chains, resulting in a more rigid and less mobile structure. This can make the polymer less susceptible to creep deformation, as there are fewer molecular chains that can move and deform under stress.

The context also mentions that the creep resistance of composites made of bio-based epoxy resin, reinforced with flax fibers, was investigated in Jia and Fiedler (2020). The study used prepregs with 4 layers of flax fabric, which were pre-dried and vacuum cured to form a cross-linked network. The results showed that the creep resistance of the composites increased with increasing cross-link density.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the context, the most likely answer is (B) increasing the cross-link density.

Explanation:
The passive film in stainless steel is a thin oxide layer that forms on the surface of the material when it is exposed to an electrolyte. This film provides protection against corrosion by preventing the reaction of the metal with the electrolyte. The formation of the passive film occurs through a complex electrochemical process that involves the oxidation of the metal surface and the reduction of oxygen in the electrolyte.

The anodic polarization behavior of a stainless steel in an electrolyte solution, such as 3.5% NaCl, consists of several regions: active dissolution, passivity, and trans-passive dissolution. The active dissolution region is characterized by a high current density and the rapid dissolution of the metal. The passivity region is characterized by a low current density and the formation of the passive film. The trans-passive dissolution region is characterized by a sudden increase in current density and the breakdown of the passive film.

The passive film forms above the trans-passive potential, which is the potential at which the passive film breaks down and the trans-passive dissolution occurs. Therefore, the answer is (C) Trans-passive potential.",,,0,

The technique involves extremely slow directional cooling and the design of a ""crystal selector,"" a pigtail-shaped tortuous opening at the base of the casting mold, which ensures that only one grain survives and grows into the liquid alloy when the mold is slowly withdrawn out of the hot zone of the furnace.

Therefore, the molecular weight of one mer unit is (12 g/mol for carbon x 2) + (1 g/mol for hydrogen x 4) = 28 g/mol.

The degree of polymerization is the number of mer units in an average polyethylene molecule, so the average molecular weight is 28 g/mol/mer x 30000 mer = 848,000 g/mol or 848 kg/mol.

(A) 44.9% (B) 66.1% (C) 55.1% (D) 34.9% ","To find the volume % of proeutectoid α just below 723°C for the steel, we need to use the lever rule. The lever rule states that the sum of the product of the mole fractions of each phase and their respective volumes is equal to 1.

First, we need to find the mole fractions of each phase. We can calculate the mole fraction of α from its weight percentage, which is given as 0.02 wt.%. The mole fraction of carbon in α is 0.0088 (since it contains 0.02 wt.% C), and the molecular weight of iron is 55.85 g/mol.

Mole fraction of α = (mass of α / total mass) * (1 / molecular weight of α)
Mole fraction of α = (0.02 * 100) / (100 + 6.67*100) * (1 / 55.85)
Mole fraction of α = 0.00052

The mole fraction of γ is 1 - mole fraction of α = 0.99948

Now, we can use the lever rule to find the volume % of proeutectoid α:

Volume % of α = (mole fraction of α * volume of α) / (mole fraction α + mole fraction γ * volume of γ) * 100%

We don't have the volume of each phase given, but we can calculate it using the given weight percentages and the densities of α and γ.

Density of α = 7.7 g/cm³
Density of γ = 7.87 g/cm³

The total weight of the steel is:
Total weight = (3 wt.% C * 12 g/mol) + (0.8 wt.% Mn * 54.94 g/ol) + (1.2 wt.% Si * 28.09 g/ol) + (0.4 wt.% P * 30.97 g/ol) + (0.04 wt.% S * 32.07 g/ol) + (99.1 wt.% Fe * 7.87 g/cm³ * 100)
Total weight = 3.78 kg

The weight of α is:
Weight of α = 0.02 wt.% * 3.78 kg = 0.0757 g

The volume of α is:
Volume of α = 0.0757 g / 7.7 g/cm³ = 0.0100 cm³

The weight of γ is:
Weight of γ = 99.1 wt.% * 3.78 kg = 3.74 kg

The volume of γ is:
Volume of γ = 3.74 kg / 7.87 g/cm³ = 4.75 cm³

Now, we can calculate the volume % of proeutectoid α:

Volume % of α = (0.00052 * 0.0100 cm³) / (0.00052 * 0.0100 cm³ + 0.99948 * 4.75 cm³) * 100%

Explanation:

The context provided describes the behavior of diffusion coefficients and the growth rate of crystals or precipitates during solidification.

Phase transition,15,G-XEC-2012-18,MCQS-NUM,63,A plain 0.45 wt.% carbon steel is cooled slowly from 900°C to just below the eutectoid temperature (723°C) so that the following reaction occurs: γ (0.8 wt.% C) ↔ α (0.02 wt.% C) + $Fe_3C$ (6.67 wt.% C). Find the volume % of pearlite for the steel just below 723°C for 0.45 wt.% carbon steel.  (A) 44.9% (B) 55.1% (C) 40.9% (D) 59.1%," To find the volume % of pearlite for the steel just below 723°C for 0.45 wt.% carbon steel, we need to use the given information about the phase transformation and the fractions of each phase in the equilibrium iron-carbon phase diagram.

First, let's find the fractions of each phase in the steel just below 723°C based on the given carbon content. From the iron-carbon phase diagram, we can see that for a carbon content of 0.45%, the steel is in the austenitic phase at higher temperatures. However, when it is cooled below the eutectoid temperature of 723°C, it transforms into pearlite and ferrite.

The equilibrium fractions of pearlite and ferrite for a carbon content of 0.45% can be found by applying the lever rule to the phase diagram. The lever rule states that the sum of the mole fractions of the two phases in equilibrium is equal to 1. Since we are given the weight percentages, we need to convert them to mole fractions using the molar masses of iron, carbon, and cementite.

The molar mass of iron is 55.85 g/mol, the molar mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol, and the molar mass of cementite (Fe3C) is 169.32 g/mol.

First, let's find the mole fraction of carbon in the steel:

C = 0.45% = 0.00045 × 12.01 g/mol = 0.005407 mol/kg

The total mass of the steel is the sum of the masses of iron and carbon:

Total mass = (1 − C) × Mw(Fe) + C × Mw(C)
Total mass = (1 − 0.005407) × 55.85 g/mol + 0.005407 × 12.01 g/mol
Total mass = 55.7946 g/mol

Now, we can find the mole fractions of iron and pearlite (cementite) using the lever rule:

Fe = (Mw(Fe) / (Mw(Fe) + Mw(C) + Mw(Fe3C))) × Total mass
Fe = (55.85 g/mol / (55.85 g/mol + 12.01 g/mol + 169.32 g/mol)) × 55.7946 g/mol
Fe = 0.9715 mol/kg

The mole fraction of pearlite (cementite) is the difference between the mole fractions of carbon and iron:

Pearlite = Xp = XC - XFe
Pearlite = 0.005407 mol/kg - 0.9715 mol/kg
Pearlite = -0.9661 mol/kg

Since the mole fraction cannot be negative, this means that the given carbon content does not correspond to an equilibrium pearlite fraction just below the eutectoid temperature. However, we can still estimate the volume % of pearlite based on the given information about the phase transformation.

The given information states that the steel transforms into pearlite and ferrite in the given temperature range, but it does not specify the exact fractions of each phase. However, we can assume that the transformation is approximately equal, since the carbon content is close to the eutectoid composition. Therefore, we can estimate the volume % of pearlite to be around 50%.

So, the answer is (B) 55.1%.",,,0,
Phase transition,16,G-XEC-2021-15,NUM,82,"(Given: 1 atm = 1.01325 × $10^(5)$ Pa). An element transforms from α to β at 773 K and 1 atm pressure with 912 J $mol^(−1)$ as enthalpy of transformation. The molar volumes of α and β phases are 7.377 $cm^3$ and 7.317 $cm^3$ , respectively. Assume that the difference in molar volumes of α and β is independent of pressure. The pressure (in atm) required for α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is (round off to nearest integer) "," To find the pressure required for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K, we can use the Clapeyron equation (7.9) which relates the pressure, temperature, and enthalpy of transformation for a phase equilibrium.

First, we need to find the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the transformation at 773 K and 1 atm. We are given that ΔH = 912 J $mol^(−1)$.

Next, we can rearrange the Clapeyron equation to find the pressure (p) as a function of temperature (T) and ΔH:

dp/dT = ΔH/TΔV

We are given that the difference in molar volumes (ΔV) of the α and β phases is constant and equal to 0.06 cm³ $mol^(−1)$. We can convert this value to Pa·m³ $mol^(−1)$ by multiplying by Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³ $mol^(−1)$) and the conversion factor from cm³ to m³ (10⁶):

ΔV = 0.06 cm³ $mol^(−1)$ × 6.022 × 10²³ $mol^(−1)$ × 10⁶ m³ $mol^(−1)$ = 3.611 × 10⁶ Pa·m³ $mol^(−1)$

Now we can substitute the given values into the Clapeyron equation:

dp/dT = 912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (773 K × 3.611 × 10⁶ Pa·m³ $mol^(−1)$)

To find the pressure at 723 K, we need to integrate this equation from the known pressure at 773 K (1 atm = 1.01325 × 10⁵ Pa) to the unknown pressure at 723 K:

∫(dp/dT) dt = ∫(912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (773 K × 3.611 × 10⁶ Pa·m³ $mol^(−1)$)) dt

We can use the integral of the inverse function of the natural logarithm (ln) to solve this integral:

∫(dp/dT) dt = ln(p/1.01325 × 10⁵ Pa) = ln(p) - ln(1.01325 × 10⁵ Pa)

Now we can use the fact that the natural logarithm of a product is the sum of the natural logarithms of the factors:

ln(p) = ln(1.01325 × 10⁵ Pa) + ∫(912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (773 K × 3.611 × 10⁶ Pa·m³ $mol^(−1)$)) dt

We can evaluate the integral by finding the antiderivative of the integrand and then evaluating it at the limits of integration:

∫(912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (773 K × 3.611 × 10⁶ Pa·m³ $mol^(−1)$)) dt = (912 J $mol^(−1)$ / (773 K × 3.611 × 10⁶ Pa·m³ $mol^(−1)$)) × t + C

where C is the constant of integration. We can find the value of C by using the known pressure at 773 K:

ln(1.01325 × 10⁵ Pa) = ln(1.01325) + ln(10⁵) = 6.9904 + 7.745996 = 14.736396

So, C = ln(1.01325 × 10⁵ Pa) - 14.736396 = -13.726396

During heating, Ti undergoes allotropic transformation from hcp to bcc at 882 °C. The percent volume change accompanying this transformation is (round off to 1 decimal place) "," To find the percent volume change during the allotropic transformation of Ti from hcp to bcc, we first need to calculate the molar volumes of hcp and bcc Ti.

Molar volume of hcp Ti:
V\_hcp = (Number of atoms in a unit cell) × (Volume of the unit cell)

Given that the density of hcp Ti is 4.51 g $cm^(−3)$, we can find the volume of the unit cell using its density:

V\_hcp = (1 g) / (4.51 g $cm^(−3)$) = 0.2218 $cm^3$ $mol^(−1)$

Now, we can use Avogadro's number to find the number of atoms in the unit cell:

Number of atoms in the unit cell = V\_hcp × Avogadro's number

Number of atoms in the unit cell = 0.2218 $cm^3$ $mol^(−1)$ × 6.023 × 10^(23) $mol^(−1)$ = 13.31 × 10^(22)

Since hcp Ti has two formula units per unit cell, the number of Ti atoms in the unit cell is half of the total number of atoms:

Number of Ti atoms in the unit cell = 13.31 × 10^(22) × 0.5 = 6.655 × 10^(22)

Molar volume of bcc Ti:
V\_bcc = (Number of atoms in a unit cell) × (Volume of the unit cell)

The lattice parameter of bcc Ti is given as 0.332 nm, which is equivalent to 0.332 × 10^(−8) $cm$. We can find the volume of the unit cell using its edge length:

V\_bcc = (Number of atoms in a unit cell) × (Edge length)^3

Since bcc Ti has two formula units per unit cell, the number of Ti atoms in the unit cell is twice the number of atoms in the simple cubic lattice:

Number of Ti atoms in the unit cell = 2 × (Number of atoms in a simple cubic lattice)

Number of Ti atoms in a simple cubic lattice = (1/2) × Avogadro's number × (Edge length)^3

Number of Ti atoms in the unit cell = 2 × (1/2) × 6.023 × 10^(23) × (0.332 × 10^(−8))^3 = 4.195 × 10^(22)

Molar volume of bcc Ti = V\_bcc / (Number of Ti atoms in the unit cell)

Molar volume of bcc Ti = 4.195 × 10^(22) / (4.195 × 10^(22)) = 1 $cm^3$ $mol^(−1)$

Percent volume change during the transformation:

ΔV = V\_bcc - V\_hcp

ΔV = 1 $cm^3$ $mol^(−1)$ - 0.2218 $cm^3$ $mol^(−1)$ = 0.7782 $cm^3$ $mol^(−1)$

Percent volume change = (ΔV / V\_hcp) × 100%

Percent volume change = (0.7782 $cm^3$ $mol^(−1)$ / 0.2218 $cm^3$ $mol^(−1)$) × 100% = 348.3%

Explanation:

The text states that the condition for equilibrium between two phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is the equality of the chemical potentials of all components in both phases. In this case, there are only two components, $x$ and $y$, present in the phases. Therefore, the conditions for equilibrium are:

$\left(\mu\_x\right)^\alpha = \left(\mu\_x\right)^\beta$ and $\left(\mu\_y\right)^\alpha = \left(\mu\_y\right)^\beta$

However, since the text also states that the two phases are in thermal and mechanical equilibrium, which means they have the same temperature and pressure, we can use the given equation (7.1) to derive the relationship between the pressure and temperature at phase equilibrium:

$\mu\_1(p,T) = \mu\_2(p,T)$

where $\mu\_1$ and $\mu\_2$ represent the chemical potentials of component 1 (which could be $x$ or $y$) in phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively.

Since $x$ and $y$ are the only components present in the phases, we can substitute 1 with $x$ or $y$ in the above equation to get:

$\mu\_x(p,T) = \mu\_x(p,T)$ and $\mu\_y(p,T) = \mu\_y(p,T)$

Eutectic reactions are characterized by the formation of a solid solution from the liquid phase, where the liquid and solid phases coexist at a constant temperature. This is described by reaction 4 in Group II, where a solid (𝛼) and a liquid (𝐿) react to form another solid (𝛼).

In an iron-carbon alloy containing 0.35 wt.% C, the mass fraction of pearlilte just below the eutectoid temperature is? (answer up to two decimal places)","To find the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature, we can use the lever rule. The lever rule states that the mass fraction of each phase in a eutectic reaction is given by the ratio of the length of the arm between the eutectoid composition and the composition in question, to the total length of the lever.

First, we need to find the length of the arms of the lever. The length of the arm for ferrite is the difference between the eutectoid composition and the composition in question, multiplied by the mass fraction of ferrite in the eutectoid composition. The length of the arm for pearlite is the difference between the composition in question and the eutectoid composition, multiplied by the mass fraction of pearlite in the eutectoid composition.

The mass fraction of ferrite in the eutectoid composition is given as 0.8 wt.%, or 0.08. The mass fraction of pearlite in the eutectoid composition is 1 - 0.08 = 0.92.

The composition of the alloy is 0.35 wt.% C, which is less than the eutectoid composition. Therefore, the mass fraction of pearlite will be greater than 0.92.

The length of the arm for ferrite is:

length of arm for ferrite = (0.08) * (0.8 - 0.35)
length of arm for ferrite = 0.08 * 0.45
length of arm for ferrite = 0.036

The length of the arm for pearlite is:

length of arm for pearlite = (0.92) * (0.35 - 0.025)
length of arm for pearlite = 0.92 * 0.325
length of arm for pearlite = 0.301

The total length of the lever is the sum of the lengths of the arms for ferrite and pearlite:

total length of lever = length of arm for ferrite + length of arm for pearlite
total length of lever = 0.036 + 0.301
total length of lever = 0.337

The mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature is the length of the arm for pearlite divided by the total length of the lever:

mass fraction of pearlite = length of arm for pearlite / total length of lever
mass fraction of pearlite = 0.301 / 0.337
mass fraction of pearlite = 0.901

y = 1 - exp(-ktn)

Substituting k = 1.106, n = 2, and t = 400, we get:

y = 1 - exp(-1.106 * 2 * 400) = 0.682

In a Jominy end-quench test of the eutectoid plain-carbon steel, the sequence of microstructures observed from the quenched end of the specimen is as follows:

1. Martensite: Martensite is the metastable solid solution of iron and carbon that forms when the austenite is rapidly quenched. It is the hardest microstructure and forms first at the quenched end of the specimen.
2. Martensite: More martensite continues to form as the cooling rate decreases away from the quenched end.
3. Pearlite: At moderately fast cooling rates, a mixture of bainite, martensite, and retained austenite may form. However, in the context of the question, it is mentioned that only the eutectoid plain-carbon steel is being tested, which means that pearlite will not form in this case.

The volume of a BCC unit cell is given by:

V\_BCC = a³

The volume of an FCC unit cell is given by:

V\_FCC = (a³/4)

So the ratio of the volumes is:

V\_FCC/V\_BCC = (a³/4)/a³ = 1/4

/Delta1H∗

Since we are given the melting temperature (Tm) and enthalpy of melting (ΔHm), we can find ΔVm (molar volume change) using the given equation:

ΔHm = ΔHvap + ΔHfus

where ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, which is not given. However, since copper does not undergo significant vaporization during solidification, we can assume ΔHvap to be negligible.

So, ΔHm ≈ ΔHfus

Now, we can find ΔVm using the given equation:

ΔHm = ΔHfus = Δ1Hs = Δ1H∗f + Δ1HfA − Δ1HfB

where Δ1Hs is the latent heat of solidification, Δ1H∗f is the enthalpy of fusion, and Δ1HfA and Δ1HfB are the enthalpies of solid and liquid copper, respectively.

We are given Δ1Hm = 13.05 × 10³ J/mol and Tm = 1356 K.

Using the given equation, we can find Δ1H∗f:

Δ1H∗f = Δ1Hm + Δ1HfA − Δ1HfB

We are given Δ1HfB (cp for liquid copper) = 32.43 − 3.10 × 10⁻³ T J/Kmol. We can assume Δ1HfA (cp for solid copper) to be the same as the given value for solid copper (23.56 + 9.75 × 10⁻³ T J/Kmol).

Substituting the given values, we get:

Δ1H∗f = 13.05 × 10³ J/mol + 23.56 + 9.75 × 10⁻³ (1356 K) − (32.43 − 3.10 × 10⁻³ (1356 K))

Δ1H∗f ≈ 13.05 × 10³ J/mol + 23.56 + 9.75 × 10⁻³ (1356 K) − 32.43 + 3.10 × 10⁻³ (1356 K)

Δ1H∗f ≈ 13.05 × 10³ J/mol + 26.32 × 10³ J/mol

Δ1H∗f ≈ 39.37 × 10³ J/mol

Now, we can find Δ1Vm using the given equation:

The value of free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for liquid to solid transformation at 1058K is?(round off to nearest integer),"To calculate the free energy change for the liquid to solid transformation of copper at 1058K, we need to use the given equation (4.93) from the context:

dG(ph.I) = dG(ph.II)

We are given the temperature (1058K) and the enthalpy change (ΔH = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$) for the phase transformation. We can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) using the given equation (4.22) with the assumption that $(C_p)^{liquid}$ = $(C_p)^{solid}$:

dG = ΔH - TΔS

First, we need to calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the phase transformation:

ΔS = ΔH / T

Given: ΔH = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$

To find T, we need to use the melting point of copper (1358K) and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (4.95) from the context:

ln(P2/P1) = ΔHtr / (R * ΔT)

We are not given the pressures (P1 and P2), but we can rearrange the equation to find ΔT:

ΔT = ΔHtr / (R * ln(P2/P1))

We are not given the transition temperature (T) or the temperature difference (ΔT), but we can use the given melting point (1358K) and the latent heat of melting (13400 J $mol^(-1)$) to find ΔHtr:

ΔHtr = ΔH = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$

We can also find R (the gas constant) using the given specific heat capacities of copper (24.0 J $mol^(-1)$ $K^(-1)$):



R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)$ $K^(-1)$

Now, we can calculate ΔT:

ΔT = ΔHtr / (R * ln(P2/P1))

ΔT = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$ / (8.314 J $mol^(-1)$ $K^(-1)$ * ln(P2/P1))

Since we don't have the pressures, we cannot find the temperature difference (ΔT) and thus cannot calculate the entropy change (ΔS) directly. However, we can make an approximation by assuming that the temperature difference is small and using the given melting point (1358K) as an estimate for the transformation temperature (T).

With this approximation, we can calculate the entropy change (ΔS) using the given equation:

ΔS = ΔH / T

ΔS = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$ / 1358K

ΔS ≈ 9.91 J $K^(-1)$ $mol^(-1)$

Now, we can calculate the free energy change (ΔG) using the given equation:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

ΔG = 13400 J $mol^(-1)$ - 1358K * 9.91 J $K^(-1)$ $mol^(-1)$

ΔG ≈ 13290.1 J $mol^(-1)$

First, let's calculate the weight loss of the Mg anode:

Weight loss = mass loss

Given mass = 1 kg

Now, we need to find the mass loss in grams:

1 kg = 1000 g

So, the mass loss in grams is 1000 g.

Next, we need to find the moles of Mg that have corroded:

Moles of Mg = mass loss (g) / atomic weight of Mg (g/mol)

Moles of Mg = 1000 g / 24.31 g/mol

Moles of Mg ≈ 41.15 mol

Now, we need to find the number of electrons transferred during the corrosion process. Since Mg loses 2 electrons during the corroxion process, we have:

Charge transferred = 2 * moles of Mg * Avogadro's number

Charge transferred = 2 * 41.15 mol * 6.022 × 10^23 electrons/mol

Charge transferred ≈ 2.68 × 10^25 electrons

$E_{cell} = E_{cell,standard} - \frac{RT}{nF}ln\left(\frac{a_{Cd^{2+},cathode}}{a_{Ni^{2+},anode}}\right)$

Since the voltage is zero, the cell potential is equal to the potential difference between the two half-cells:

$E_{cell} = E_{Ni/Ni^{2+}} - E_{Cd/Cd^{2+}}$

Substituting the given standard electrode reduction potentials:

$0 = -0.250V - (-0.403V)$

$0.153V$

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the activity ratio of $Ni^{2+}$ and $Cd^{2+}$ ions:

$\frac{a_{Cd^{2+}}}{a_{Ni^{2+}}} = e^{\frac{nF}{RT}E_{cell}}$

Given $E_{cell} = 0.153V$, $n = 2$, $R = 8.31J\ mol^{-1}K^{-1}$, $F = 96500C\ mol^{-1}$, $T = 298.15K$, and $a_{Cd^{2+}} = 1M = 1Molar = 1Molarity = 1mol\ L^{-1}$:

$a_{Ni^{2+}} = e^{\frac{0.346}{1}} = 1.398$

Since the activity of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the standard state is 1, we can find the activity concentration (molarity) of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution:

$[Ni^{2+}] = a_{Ni^{2+}} \times Molarity$

$[Ni^{2+}] = 1.398 \times 1Molar = 1.398Molar = 1.398\times10^{3}M$

To convert this to micro molar:

$[Ni^{2+}] = 1.398\times10^{3}M \times 10^{6} \mu mol\ L^{-1} \mu mol\ L^{-1}$

$[Ni^{2+}] = 1.398\times10^{9} \mu mol\ L^{-1}$

Doping with arsenic or aluminum can also increase the electrical conductivity of silicon by introducing impurities that donate or accept electrons, respectively. This is known as extrinsic conductivity.

First, we need to find the number of free electrons per cubic centimeter (n) using the electrical resistivity and the electron mobility:

n = 1 / (ρ * μ)

where ρ is the electrical resistivity and μ is the electron mobility.

Substituting the given values:

n = 1 / (1.7 * $10^(-8)$ Ωm * 3.2 * $10^(-3)$ m^2V^(-1)s^(-1))
n = 8.48 * $10^28$ m^(-3)

Now, we need to find the average number of free electrons per atom. We know that copper has a density (d) of 8.96 g/cm^3 and an atomic mass (M) of 63.55 g/mol.

N = d * N0 / M

where N0 is the Avogadro constant.

Substituting the given values:

N = 8.96 g/cm^3 * 6.022 * $10^23$ atoms/mol / 63.55 g/mol
N = 8.51 * $10^28$ m^(-3)

Now, we can find the average number of free electrons per atom by dividing the number of free electrons per cubic centimeter by the number of atoms per cubic centimeter:

Number of free electrons per atom = n / N

Substituting the calculated values:

Number of free electrons per atom = 8.48 * $10^28$ m^(-3) / 8.51 * $10^28$ m^(-3)
Number of free electrons per atom = 1

However, this result is not correct because we expect more than one free electron per atom in copper. The discrepancy is due to the fact that we assumed all electrons in the conduction band, but in reality, only a fraction of the electrons contribute to the electrical conduction.

j = νnεE = nqμnE

where j is the current density, νn is the number density of electrons, q is the charge of an electron, μn is the mobility of electrons, and E is the electric field.

First, we need to find the electric field inside the semiconductor. The electric field can be calculated using the potential difference (V) and the length of the cube (L):

E = V/L

The potential difference (V) can be calculated using the applied voltage (V0) and the number of electrons (n) and their charge (q):

Substituting the given values, we have:

V = (1.6 * 10^-19 C) * ($10^{12}$ cm^-3) * (1 cm)^2 = 1.6 * 10^-13 J

Now, we can calculate the electric field:

E = V/L = 1.6 * 10^-13 J / 1 cm = 1.6 * 10^-13 V/cm

$E^\circ (Li^+/Li) = -3.04$ V versus SHE
$E^\circ (Zn^{2+}/Zn) = -0.77$ V versus SHE

To find the potential difference between the $Li^+/Li$ and $Zn^{2+}/Zn$ reference electrodes, we can use the difference in their standard electrode potentials:

$E^\circ (Li^+/Li) - E^\circ (Zn^{2+}/Zn) = -3.04$ V - (-0.77) V = -2.27 V

Now, we know that the reaction occurs at +4.50 V against a $Li^+/Li$ reference electrode. To find the potential against a $Zn^{2+}/Zn$ reference electrode, we need to add the potential difference between the two reference electrodes to the potential of the reaction against the $Li^+/Li$ electrode:

The standard potential for the given reaction is given as -0.136 V versus SHE.

T = 298 K, pH = 5, and pH2 = 1 atm

First, we need to calculate the hydrogen ion activity (aH+) from the given pH value using the equation:

pH = -log10(aH+)

pH = 5 => aH+ = 10^-5 M

Next, we need to calculate the hydrogen gas pressure (pH2) using the equation:

Now, we can calculate the reduction potential for the given reaction using the Nernst equation:

Substituting the given values:

E = -0.136 V + (8.314 J/mol*K * 298 K / 2 * 96,485 C/mol) ln(10^-2 / 10^-5)

E = -0.136 V + (8.314 J/mol*K * 298 K / 2 * 96,485 C/mol) ln(10^-3)

E = -0.136 V + (8.314 J/mol*K * 298 K / 2 * 96,485 C/mol) (-0.477)

E⁰ = E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = -0.337 V

Next, we need to calculate the reaction quotient Q. The activity of copper(II) ions is given as 0.9 (Raoultian standard state), so we can calculate the activity of copper(I) assuming 100% faradaic efficiency (all the copper(II) is reduced to copper(I)):

aCu = aCu²⁺ / (1 + α)

where α is the stoichiometric coefficient of copper(II) ions. Since there is one copper(II) ion and two electrons involved in the reaction, α = 1.

aCu = aCu²⁺ / (1 + 1) = aCu²⁺ / 2

We don't have a direct value for aCu²⁺, but we can use the Legendre convention to relate the activities of copper(II) and copper(I) at the same temperature and pressure:

ln(aCu / aCu²⁺) = ΔG° / RT

where ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. We can use tabulated values or calculate it from the standard reduction potentials:

ΔG° = -nFE⁰ = -2 × 96500 × (-0.337) = 61,612 J/mol

aCu = aCu²⁺ / 2 = 0.9 / 2 = 0.45

Now we can calculate the reaction quotient Q:

Q = aCu²⁺ / aCu²⁺ = aCu²⁺ / (aCu²⁺ × aCu) = 1 / aCu = 1 / 0.45 = 2.22

Substituting the values into the Nernst equation, we get:

E = -0.337 V - (8.314 J/mol·K·1 × 300 K / 2 × 96500 C/mol) ln(2.22)

E = -0.337 V - (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/C) ln(2.22)

E = -0.337 V - (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/C) × 0.699

E = -0.337 V - 9.52 × 10⁻⁵ J

E = -0.327 V (approximation)

E = -327 mV

Percentage of copper in the concentrate = 21%
Mass of copper in the concentrate = 21,000,000 g

2. Calculate the mass of copper deposited during the electrolysis process:

What is the absolute value of the cell potential (in millivolts) at 25°C, given that copper is divalent? Faraday constant is 96500 C/mol and the universal gas constant is 8.314 J/(mol.K)."," To calculate the absolute value of the cell potential at 25°C for an electrolytic refining cell for copper, we can use the Nernst equation:

E = E⁰ - (RT / nF) ln(a_(Cu, anode) / a_(Cu, cathode))

where:
- E⁰ is the standard potential for the copper reduction reaction
- R is the universal gas constant
- T is the temperature in Kelvin
- n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (for copper, n = 2)
- F is the Faraday constant
- a_(Cu, anode) and a_(Cu, cathode) are the activities of copper at the anode and cathode, respectively

Given:
- a_(Cu, anode) = 0.8
- a_(Cu, cathode) = 1 (since pure copper is the cathode)
- T = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

First, we need to find the standard potential for the copper reduction reaction. From the context, we know that the standard potential for the copper oxidation reaction (Cu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻) is 0.337 V. Since the reduction reaction is the reverse of the oxidation reaction, the standard potential for the reduction reaction is the negative of the oxidation potential:

E⁰ = -0.337 V = -337 mV

Now we can calculate the cell potential:

E = -337 mV - (8.314 J/(mol.K) * 298.15 K / (2 * 96500 C/mol)) * ln(0.8)

Using a calculator, we find:

In electrolytic refining of Ni, the anode is Cu-10 atom % Ni and the cathode is pure Ni. Assuming the Cu-Ni solution to be ideal, the ABSOLUTE value of the minimum voltage (in mV) required for refining is?","To find the minimum voltage required for electrolytic refining of Ni, we can use the Nernst equation for a galvanic cell. The Nernst equation relates the potential difference between two electrodes to the concentration difference of the redox species involved in the half-cell reactions. In this case, we have a Cu-Ni redox system.

First, we need to write the half-cell reactions for the anode (Cu) and cathode (Ni). We assume ideal behavior for the Cu-Ni solution.

Anode (Cu): Cu(s) → Cu²+(aq) + 2e⁻
Cathode (Ni): Ni²+(aq) + 2e⁻ → Ni(s)

Now, we can calculate the standard potential difference (E⁰) for the cell using the standard potentials for the half-cell reactions. Since the standard potential for Cu is 0.34 V and for Ni is -0.25 V, the standard potential difference for the cell is:

E⁰ = E⁰(Cu) - E⁰(Ni) = 0.34 V - (-0.25 V) = 0.61 V

Next, we need to calculate the Nernst potential (E) for the cell at the given temperature. The Nernst potential depends on the concentration difference of the redox species. Since we assume ideal behavior for the Cu-Ni solution, the activities of the ions are equal to their molalities.

The molality of Ni²+(aq) in the anode is 0.01 molal (10 atom % Ni in the anode), and the molality of Ni²+(aq) in the cathode is 1 molal (pure Ni).

Using the Nernst equation:

E = E⁰ - (RT / nF) ln(Q)

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and Q is the reaction quotient.

Since we have a one-electron transfer reaction, n = 1.

The reaction quotient Q is the ratio of the activities (or molalities) of the products to the activities (or molalities) of the reactants. In this case, Q = [Ni(s)] / [Cu²+(aq)] = 1 / 0.01 = 100.

Substituting the given values:

E = 0.61 V - (8.314 J mol⁻¹K⁻¹ × 300 K / 1 × 96490 C mol⁻¹) × ln(100)

Calculminating in:

E = 0.61 V - 0.051 V = 0.559 V

To find the absolute value of the minimum voltage required, we need to convert the potential difference to millivolts (mV).

E = 0.559 V × 1000 mV/V = 559 mV

So, the absolute value of the minimum voltage required for electrolytic refining of Ni, assuming ideal behavior for the Cu-Ni solution, is 559 mV.

The specific energy consumption (in $kJ.kg^(-1) zinc) is? (answer up to two decimal places)","To calculate the specific energy consumption, we first need to find the electrical energy required to produce one kilogram of zinc. We can use Equation 16.14:

wmzEF = M / (3600 * kWh)

where M is the mass of zinc produced and wmzEF is the energy required to produce it.

First, we need to find the amount of zinc produced in one hour with the given current:

I = 400 A
t = 1 h
M = I * t * (1 kg / (10^3 A * h))
M = 400 * 1 * (1 / 1000)
M = 0.4 kg/h

Now, we can find the energy required to produce this amount of zinc:

wmzEF = M / (3600 * kWh)
wmzEF = 0.4 / (3600 * 1)
wmzEF = 1.11 x 10^-3 kWh/kg

Next, we need to find the actual amount of zinc produced, taking into account the cathodic current efficiency:

Theoretical amount deposited = M / (hours of operation * current density)
Theoretical amount deposited = 0.4 / (5 days * 300 A/m^2 * 0.95 m^2)
Theoretical amount deposited = 0.00133 kg

Current efficiency = Actual amount deposited / Theoretical amount deposited
Current efficiency = 0.9

Actual amount deposited = Theoretical amount deposited * current efficiency
Actual amount deposited = 0.00133 * 0.9
Actual amount deposited = 0.0012 kg

Now, we can find the energy required to produce this actual amount of zinc:

wmzEF = M / (3600 * kWh)
wmzEF = 0.0012 / (3600 * 1)
wmzEF = 3.33 x 10^-5 kWh/kg

Finally, we can find the specific energy consumption:

Specific energy consumption = wmzEF * 10^3
Specific energy consumption = 3.33 x 10^-5 * 10^3
Specific energy consumption = 3.33 kJ/kg

E = E° - (RT/nF) ln(Q)

where E is the cell potential, E° is the standard potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and Q is the reaction quotient.

We are given the cell potential (0.5 V) and the standard potentials for Zn and Fe (−0.76 V and −0.44 V, respectively). We need to find the reaction quotient Q.

First, let's write the half-reactions for the Zn and Fe electrodes:

Zn: Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn
Fe: Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Fe

The overall reaction is the sum of the half-reactions:

Zn + Fe²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Fe

The reaction quotient Q is the ratio of the activities of the products to the activities of the reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients:

Q = [Zn²⁺][Fe]/[Zn][Fe²⁺]

Since we are given the concentrations in terms of molarity, we can assume that the activities are proportional to the concentrations. Therefore, we can write:

Q = ([Zn²⁺]/[Zn]) × ([Fe]/[Fe²⁺])

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the potential of the cell:

0.5 V = −(8.314 J.mol⁻¹.K⁻¹ × 298 K)/(2 × 96500 C.mol⁻¹) × ln(Q)

Solving for ln(Q):

ln(Q) = −(0.5 V × 2 × 96500 C.mol⁻¹)/(8.314 J.mol⁻¹.K⁻¹ × 298 K)
ln(Q) ≈ −1.03

Taking the exponent of both sides:

Q ≈ e⁻¹.03 ≈ 0.1

Now, we can find the ratio of the concentrations:

[Fe]/[Fe²⁺] = 1
[Zn]/[Zn²⁺] = 1

So, Q = [Zn²⁺][Fe]/[Zn][Fe²⁺] = 1

Taking the logarithm of both sides and solving for the ratio [Fe]/[Zn]:

ln(1) = ln([Zn²⁺]/[Zn]) + ln([Fe]/[Fe²⁺])
ln(1) = ln([Zn]/[Zn²⁺]) - ln([Fe²⁺]/[Fe])

Since ln(1) = 0, we have:

ln([Fe²⁺]/[Fe]) = -ln([Zn]/[Zn²⁺])

Using the given standard potentials, we can calculate the ratio of the activities of Zn²⁺ and Fe²⁺ ions:

a(Zn²⁺)/a(Fe²⁺) = e⁺(E°(Zn²⁺/Zn) - E°(Fe²⁺/Fe))
a(Zn²⁺)/a(Fe²⁺) ≈ e⁺((−0.76 V - (−0.44 V)) = e⁺0.32 V

Now, we can find the ratio of the concentrations:

[Fe]/[Zn] = [Fe²⁺]/[Zn²⁺] × a(Zn²⁺)/a(Fe²⁺)

Since a(Zn²⁺)/a(Fe²⁺) ≈ e⁺0.32, we can assume that the activities are approximately equal to the concentrations:

Here, E° is the standard potential for the iron/water reaction, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and F is the Faraday constant.

For the iron/water reaction, E° = -0.447 V (Table 9.1). Assuming a temperature of 25°C (298 K), we have:

R = 8.314 J/mol·K
n = 2
F = 96,485 C/mol

Substituting these values, we get:

E = -0.447 V + (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(15 mM / [Fe2+])

E = -0.447 V + (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K / (2 * 96,485 C/mol)) * ln(15 mM / 10^-6 M)
E = -0.447 V + 0.059 V
E = -0.388 V

2. Calculate the overpotential (η) using the Nernst potential and the applied potential:
η = E - E°
η = -0.388 V - (-0.447 V)
η = 0.059 V

3. Use the Tafel equation to calculate the current density (j):
j = j0 * exp((η + ba)/bT)

Here, j0 is the exchange current density, ba is the Tafel slope, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Assuming a typical value for the exchange current density of j0 = 10^-3 A/cm^2 for iron in fresh water, we get:

j = 10^-3 A/cm^2 * exp((0.059 V + 0.06 V)/(0.06 V * 298 K))
j = 10^-3 A/cm^2 * exp(0.118)

Mass of P in 1 gm of Si = 0.1 parts per billion * 1 gm = 0.000001 gm

Np = (0.000001 gm) / (6.02 * 10^23 * 28.09 gm/mol)
Np ≈ 3.53 * 10^12 atoms/cm^3

Explanation:

Upon recrystallization of a cold-worked metal, the strain-free grains nucleate and consume the entire cold-worked structure, resulting in the complete restoration of mechanical properties to their pre-cold-worked state. However, the recovery process that occurs before recrystallization results in a decrease in stored energy and electrical resistivity, but only a slight lowering of hardness. The greatest simultaneous change in properties occurs during the primary recrystallization stage. Therefore, the metal after recrystallization has lower strength but increased ductility compared to the cold-worked state.",,,0,

Explanation:

The assertion is that during rolling, front tension and (or) back tension are employed to decrease rolling load. The reason given is that roll pressure decreases due to lowering of flow stress as a result of front tension/back tension.

Both the assertion and the reason are correct. The application of front tension and back tension during rolling can indeed decrease the rolling load. This is because the roll pressure is distributed along the length of contact between the roll and the workpiece. The application of front tension and back tension results in a reduction in the roll pressure at the entry and exit planes of the workpiece, respectively. This reduction in roll pressure leads to a decrease in the rolling load.

The reason given, that the roll pressure decreases due to a lowering of flow stress as a result of front tension/back tension, is also correct. The flow stress of the workpiece is affected by the applied tension, both front and back. The lowering of flow stress leads to a decrease in roll pressure, as explained above.

This loss of carbon and the development of unfavorable tensile residual stresses at the surface are detrimental to fatigue performance.

Explanation:
Weld decay, also known as sensitization, is a form of intergranular corrosion that occurs in austenitic stainless steels due to the depletion of chromium in the grain boundaries. This depletion occurs when strong carbide formers such as Nb or Ti associate with the carbon in preference to chromium, leaving the grain boundaries unprotected by the passive oxide film. Rapid cooling can help avoid weld decay, but in large structures, this is not always possible. To overcome this issue, a small amount (0.5%) of a strong carbide-former is added to the steel to stabilize it and prevent sensitization.

If the height of the green sample was 12 mm, then the fill height of powder (in mm) would have been?","To find the fill height of the powder, we first need to determine the volume of the green compact and the volume of the powder used to make it.

The volume of the green compact can be calculated using its height and cross-sectional area:

Volume of green compact = π * (diameter / 2)² * height

Given that the diameter of the green compact is not provided, we cannot directly calculate its volume. However, we can use the given green density to find the mass of the green compact and then calculate its volume based on a density of 5.5 g/$cm^3$.

First, let's find the mass of the green compact:

Mass of green compact = density * volume

We know the density (5.5 g/$cm^3$) and the mass can be calculated from the given density and the initial powder mass (which we will find later).

Mass of green compact = (5.5 g/$cm^3$) * (mass of powder)

Now, let's find the volume of the powder used to make the green compact. Since the initial powder had a density of 2.5 g/$cm^3$, we can calculate its volume and then subtract the volume of the pores (or voids) to find the volume of the solid powder:

Volume of solid powder = (mass of powder) / (2.5 g/$cm^3$)

Since the green compact has a density of 5.5 g/$cm^3$, the volume of the green compact is:

Volume of green compact = (mass of powder) / (5.5 g/$cm^3$)

To find the mass of the powder, we can use the given height of the green compact and the volume of the powder per unit height:

Volume of powder per unit height = π * (diameter / 2)²

We don't have the diameter of the green compact, but we can use the given height and the green density to find it:

Diameter = (4 * height * density) / (π * (5.5 g/$cm^3$ - 2.5 g/$cm^3$))

Now, we can calculate the volume of the powder per unit height and then find the mass of the powder:

Volume of powder per unit height = π * (diameter / 2)²

Mass of powder = Volume of powder per unit height * height

Finally, we can find the volume of the solid powder and the volume of the green compact:

Volume of solid powder = Mass of powder / (2.5 g/$cm^3$)

Volume of green compact = Mass of powder / (5.5 g/$cm^3$)

Since the volume of the green compact is equal to the volume of the solid powder plus the volume of the pores, we can find the volume of the pores:

Volume of pores = Volume of green compact - Volume of solid powder

Now, we can find the fill height of the powder:

Fill height = Volume of powder / Volume of powder per unit height

Putting it all together:

1. Calculate the diameter of the green compact.
2. Calculate the volume of the powder per unit height.
3. Calculate the mass of the powder.
4. Calculate the volume of the solid powder.
5. Calculate the volume of the green compact.

Explanation:
Indirect compression processes are those in which uniaxial tensile stress is applied directly to the work-piece, and the reaction of the work-piece with the dies or tools induces two more compressive stresses that act on two mutually perpendicular planes. Wire drawing and deep drawing are examples of this type of process.

Forging, on the other hand, is a direct compression process in which a compressive stress is applied directly to the work-piece using a hammer or press.

The density of the as-pressed aluminium compact is 1755 kg.$m^(-3)$. If the height of the as-pressed compact is 12 mm, the fill height (in mm) required is?","To find the fill height required for compacting the aluminium powder in the cylindrical die at 600 MPa, we need to determine the green density of the compacted material and then calculate the fill height based on the given dimensions of the as-pressed compact.

First, let's find the green density of the compacted aluminium using the given data:

Apparent density of aluminium powder = 810 kg.m⁻³
Density of as-pressed aluminium compact = 1755 kg.m⁻³

Since the density of the as-pressed compact is greater than the apparent density of the powder, we can assume that the green density is between these two values. Let's call it ρg.

We can use the given relationship between the green density, compaction pressure, and particle size to estimate the green density:

ln(1 - p) = In(ρg/ρp)⁴ - m In(P/Po)

where p is the porosity, P is the compaction pressure, ρg is the green density, ρp is the particle density (assumed to be the same as the apparent density), Po is the pressure at which the green density is 100% theoretical, and m is a compaction constant.

We don't have a value for Po or m, but we can assume that they are constant for aluminium powder and can be approximated based on the data given in the text. Let's assume m = 0.5 and Po = 1 GPa (a typical value for metals).

Substituting the given values, we get:

ln(1 - p) = In(ρg/810)⁴ - 0.5 In(600/1000000000)

Solving for ρg, we get:

ρg = 810(10⁴)ⁱ⁴(1 - p)ⁱ⁴(10⁶)ⁱ⁻(0.5)

Now, we can calculate the fill height required based on the given dimensions of the as-pressed compact:

Volume of as-pressed compact = πr²h

where r is the radius of the compact and h is the height.

The volume of the green compact is equal to the volume of the as-pressed compact, so:

ρgπr²h = ρapπr²(h₀ - h)

where ρap is the apparent density of the powder, h₀ is the fill height, and h is the height of the as-pressed compact.

Solving for h₀, we get:

h₀ = h + (ρg/ρap)h

Substituting the given values, we get:

h₀ = 12 + (1755/810)12

Using a calculator, we find that h₀ ≈ 21.5 mm.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) P < S < Q < R

Explanation:

From the context, it is mentioned that sand casting is a process where the mould is made by ramming sand into a pattern, and the sand particles remain embedded on the metal surface after solidification. This results in a rougher surface finish compared to other casting processes.

Investment casting, on the other hand, uses a wax pattern that is coated with a refractory material and melted away during the casting process. This leaves a smooth, typically porosity-free, surface finish.

Permanent mould casting uses a reusable metal mould, which can be machined to produce a smooth surface finish.

Pressure die casting uses a metal die, which is subjected to high pressure and temperature to force the molten metal into the die cavity. This process results in a very smooth surface finish due to the high pressure and the precision of the die.

Energy input per unit length (W/m) = Power input (W) / Traverse speed (m/s)

First, we need to find the power input (P) in watts. We are given the current (I) in amperes and the voltage (V) in volts, so we can use the power formula:

Power (W) = I^2 * V

Substituting the given values:

Power (W) = 400^2 * 20
Power (W) = 160,000,000

Now, we can calculate the energy input per unit length:

Energy input per unit length (W/m) = Power input (W) / Traverse speed (m/s)
Energy input per unit length (W/m) = 160,000,000 / 5

To convert W/m to W/$𝑚𝑚^(−1)$, we need to convert meters to feet and watts to British thermal units (BTUs) per hour, and then divide by 3,600 hours per hour:

1 W/m = 3.2808 ft/m = 3.2808 * 5282.74 ft/mile = 17,672.53 ft/mile
1 W/m = 1 J/m = 0.2778 BTU/ft-lb

Using a calculator, we get:

Consequently, the driving force for recrystallization in heavily cold-worked metals is lower compared to less deformed metals.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.

Contribution to dilution of the weld pool is 20% from each plate. The Ni content(in wt.%) in the weld pool is?(round off to the nearest integer)","To find the Ni content in the weld pool, we need to use the given mass fraction formula (6.2) and the given compositions and dilution contributions of the plates and the filler rod.

First, let's calculate the mass fractions of Ni in each base metal and the filler rod:

* Fe-10 wt.% Ni: ωb1 = 0.1
* Fe-20 wt.% Cr-5 wt.% Ni: ωb2 = 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25
* Filler rod: ωd = 0.2

Next, we need to find the relative fusion ratio (k) between the two base metals. Since no information is given about their relative reactivity during welding, we assume a value of 1 for simplicity.

Now, we can calculate the Ni content in the weld pool using the mass fraction formula:

ωW = (1 − θ)ωd + kθωb1 + (1 − k)θωb2

Since the dilution contribution from each plate is 20%, the total mass fraction of deposited metal in the weld pool is:

ωd = 2 * 0.2 = 0.4

Substituting the values we have:

ωW = (1 − θ) * 0.4 + 1 * 0.1 * 0.1 + 1 * 0.1 * 0.25

Solving for ωW:

ωW = 0.4 - 0.4 * θ + 0.01 * θ + 0.025 * θ
ωW = 0.4 + 0.035 * θ

Since we don't have a specific value for θ, we can't find the exact Ni content in the weld pool. However, we can find the possible range of Ni content by solving for θ when ωW = 0.3 (the midpoint between the Ni contents of the base metals):

0.3 = 0.4 + 0.035 * θ
0.035 * θ = 0.1
θ = 0.02857

Now we can find the Ni content in the weld pool:

ωW = 0.4 + 0.035 * 0.02857
ωW = 0.4 + 0.00122
ωW = 0.40122

The Ni content in the weld pool is approximately 0.40 wt.%.

Energy input per unit length = Power × Travel speed × Heat transfer factor

Next, we need to find the mass of metal melted per unit length of the weld.

Mass of metal melted per unit length = Energy input per unit length / Melting factor
= 10800 J/m / 0.5
= 21600 g/m

Now, we can calculate the cross-sectional area of the weld by finding the area of a rectangle with the same mass of metal.

Density of metal = 8170 kg/m³ (given in the context)
Mass of metal in the weld = 21600 g
Cross-sectional area = Mass of metal / Density
= 21600 g / 8170 kg/m³
= 2.64 m²

To get the answer in mm², we need to convert this value to square millimeters:

Cross-sectional area = 2.64 m² × (1000 mm/m)²
= 2,672,160 mm²

Explanation:

Earing is a type of cracking that occurs in forged components due to the uneven distribution of stress during the forging process. Therefore, the process that corresponds to earning is (R) Forging.

Cold shut is a defect that occurs during deep drawing or extrusion when the metal does not flow evenly, resulting in a weld or a lack of metal flow in a particular area. Therefore, the defect that corresponds to cold shut is (1) Earing for deep drawing and (2) Squeeze-out or flash for extrusion. Since the question asks for the defect that corresponds to cold shut in deep drawing, the answer is (1).

Edge cracking is a defect that occurs when there is a crack or a weakness in the edge of a component, which can be caused by various processes such as forging, rolling, or deep drawing. However, the context provided in the question mentions that earring is a defect specific to forging, and edge cracking is mentioned separately. Therefore, the process that corresponds to edge cracking is not given in the options.

Fir-tree cracking is a type of cracking that occurs in rolled components due to the uneven distribution of stress during the rolling process. Therefore, the process that corresponds to fir-tree cracking is (S) Rolling.

We can use the formula for heat input in Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW):

Heat Input = (Current * Voltage) / (Efficiency * Speed)

Given:

Weld 1: Current = 200 A, Voltage = 18 V, Speed = 0.002 m/s
Weld 2: Speed = 0.0022 m/s

We want to find the current for Weld 2.

First, let's calculate the heat input for both welds:

Weld 1: Heat Input = (200 A * 18 V) / (0.65 * 0.002 m/s)

Now, we'll calculate the heat input for Weld 2 using the given speed:

We are given the values of D at T=400K and T=500K. We can first find the activation energy Ea by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients and rearranging the equation:

ln(D(T=500K)/D(T=400K)) = ln(D0) - (Ea/R) * (1/T(500K) - 1/T(400K))

Using the given values, we have:

ln(5.75 x $10^(-19)$ / 1.28 x $10^(-22)$) = ln(D0) - (Ea/R) * (1/500 - 1/400)

Solving for Ea, we get:

Ea = R * ln(5.75 x $10^(-19)$ / 1.28 x $10^(-22)$) / (1/500 - 1/400)

T = (-Ea/R) * ln(D/D0) + 1/R * ln(D/D0) + 1/T0

Substituting the values, we get:

D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)

where D is the diffusion coefficient, D0 is the frequency factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given the diffusion coefficients at two temperatures, so we can set up two equations and solve for Q:

1.9 * $10^(-13)$ = D0 exp(-Q/[873.15 + 273.15] * R)
5.8 * $10^(-13)$ = D0 exp(-Q/[873.15 + 273.15 + 12.5] * R)

ln(1.9 * $10^(-13)$) = ln(D0) - (Q/[873.15 + 273.15] * R)

D0 = 1.9 * $10^(-13)$ * exp[(ln(1.9 * $10^(-13)$) + (Q/[873.15 + 273.15] * R)]

Now we can substitute this value of D0 into both equations and solve for Q:

Simplifying:

ln(1.9 * $10^(-13)$) = ln(1.9 * $10^(-13)$) + ln[exp(Q/[873.15 + 273.15] * R)] - (Q/[873.15 + 273.15] * R)

ln(1.9 * $10^(-13)$) = ln[exp(Q/[873.15 + 273.15] * R)] - (Q/[873.15 + 273.15] * R)

First, we need to find the surface concentration of gallium in the silicon wafer. Let's call this concentration $C_s$. We are given that the concentration at a depth of $10^(-3)$ cm should be half of the surface concentration, so the concentration at that depth is $C_s/2$.

Using Fick's second law of diffusion, we have:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$$

where $C$ is the concentration of gallium in the silicon wafer, $x$ is the depth, $t$ is time, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

We can assume that the initial concentration of gallium in the silicon wafer is zero, and that the boundary condition at the surface is $C_s$. We can also assume that the boundary condition at the depth of $10^(-3)$ cm is $C_s/2$.

Using the given information, we can set up the following initial and boundary value problem:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$$

$$C(x,0) = 0$$

$$C(0,t) = C_s$$

$$C(L,t) = \frac{C_s}{2}$$

where $L$ is the thickness of the silicon wafer.

To solve this problem, we can use separation of variables and the method of characteristics. The solution is:

Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer)"," To calculate the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel, we need to use the Nernst equation and the corrosion reaction equation for nickel in the given solution.

The corrosion reaction equation for nickel is:
Ni(s) + 2H+ + 2e- → Ni2+ + H2(g)

Using the given standard reduction potential of nickel (-0.25 V), we can calculate the standard electrode potential (E°) for the nickel corrosion reaction.

E° = -0.25 V = -0.25 J/V = -0.25 × 1.602 × 10^-19 C/F = -4.01 × 10^-19 C

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to calculate the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel.

Nernst equation: E = E° - (RT/nF)ln(Q)

where E is the electrode potential, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, and F is Faraday's constant.

In this case, we want to find the partial pressure of hydrogen (PH2), so we need to rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for PH2.

ln(PH2) = [(E° - E) / (RT/nF)]

We can assume that the electrode potential (E) is zero when the corrosion is stopped, so we can set E = 0 in the equation.

ln(PH2) = [(E° / (RT/nF)]

Substituting the given values:

ln(PH2) = [(-4.01 × 10^-19 C / (8.314 J/K-mol × 298 K / 2 × 96500 C-mol^-1)]

ln(PH2) = -13.73

However, it's important to note that the given value of PH2 is very small and may not be achievable in practice. In reality, a small amount of hydrogen gas will always be present in the solution due to the reduction of protons during the corrosion process.

A plain carbon steel sample containing 0.1 wt% carbon is undergoing carburization at 1100 ° C in a carbon rich surroundings with fixed carbon content of 1.0 wt% all the time. The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer). ,"To find the time required for carburization, we can use Fick's second law of diffusion. First, we need to convert the given diffusivity to the appropriate units.


D = 6.0 * $10^(-11) m^2.s^(-1) = 6.0 * $10^(-11) m^2/s

Next, we can use the given equation for Fick's second law:

∂C/∂t = D * ∂²C/∂x²

We want to find the time required to reach a carbon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5 mm. First, we need to convert the weight percent to molar concentration.


Cs = 0.1 wt% = 0.1 * (12 g/mol) / (7.87 g/cm³) = 0.00148 mol/cm³
Cb = 0.46 wt% = 0.46 * (12 g/mol) / (7.87 g/cm³) = 0.0058 mol/cm³

Now, we can set up the equation for Fick's second law:

∂C/∂t = D * ∂²C/∂x²

We can assume that the boundary conditions are:

C(x, 0) = Cs
C(x, t→∞) = Cb

We can also assume that the initial carbon concentration is the same as the surface concentration, so C(x, 0) = Cs.

We can use the error function to solve for the concentration as a function of depth and time:

C(x, t) = Cs + (Cb - Cs) * erfc(x / (2 * sqrt(D * t)))

We want to find the time required to reach C(5 mm, t) = 0.0058 mol/cm³. We can set up the equation:

0.0058 = 0.00148 + (0.0058 - 0.00148) * erfc(5 / (2 * sqrt(D * t)))

We can solve for t:

t = (5 / (2 * sqrt(D)))² * erfc⁻¹(2 * (0.0058 - 0.00148) / (0.0058))

Using a calculator or software, we can find that erfc⁻¹(0.1825) ≈ 2.25

So,

t ≈ (5 / (2 * sqrt(6 * $10^(-11})))² * 2.25
t ≈ 1.13 * $10^(6) s
t ≈ 3.7 * $10^(6) hours

Given:
i0 = 10^(-5) A/m^2
beta = 0.1 V/decade
eta = 0.4 V
R = 8.314 J/mol.K = 8.314 * 10^(-3) A.s/mol.K
T = 298 K

First, we need to convert the overpotential to volts:

eta = 0.4 V

i = 10^(-5) * exp((0.1 * 0.4) / (1 * 8.314 * 10^(-3) * 298))

(Round off to 1 decimal). "," To find the time it takes for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 600 K, we can use the given equation for the diffusivity of A in the solid and the relationship between diffusion length and time.

First, we need to find the diffusivity coefficient $(D_A)°$ at 300 K using the given information that A diffuses to a depth of 10 μm in 1 hour at 300 K. We can rearrange the given equation to solve for $(D_A)°$:

$D_A = (D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_(B)T})$

$ln(D_A) = ln((D_A)°) - \frac{E_a}{k_(B)T}$

$T = \frac{E_a}{k_(B)ln(\frac{D_A}{(D_A)°})}$

We know that $D_A = \frac{(10 \mu m)^2}{1 hour} = 2.5*10^{-12} m^2/s$ and $E_a = 0.3 eV = 3.6*10^{-19} J$. We can find $k_B$ using its value in eV/K and convert it to J/mol*K:

$k_B = 8.62*10^{-5} eV/K = 1.38*10^{-23} J/mol*K$

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

$T = \frac{3.6*10^{-19} J}{1.38*10^{-23} J/mol*K*ln(\frac{2.5*10^{-12} m^2/s}{(D_A)°})}$

$T = 612.3 K$

Now that we have the temperature at which $(D_A)°$ applies, we can find $(D_A)°$ using the given equation:

$(D_A)° = D_A/exp(-{E_a/k_(B)T}) = 2.5*10^{-12} m^2/s/exp(-{0.3 eV/(8.62*10^{-5} eV/K*313.15 K)}) = 1.1*10^{-11} m^2/s$

Next, we can use the relationship between diffusion length and time to find the time it takes for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K. The diffusion length $x_d$ is given by:

$x_d = \sqrt{2D_AT}$

We want to find the time $t$ such that $x_d = 10 \mu m = 10*10^{-6} m$:

$10*10^{-6} m = \sqrt{2*(1.1*10^{-11} m^2/s)*t}$

$t = \frac{(10*10^{-6} m)^2}{2*(1.1*10^{-11} m^2/s)} = 5.5*10^3 s$

So, it takes approximately 5,500 seconds (or about 1 hour and 28 minutes) for A to diffuse to a depth of 10 μm at 600 K.

(answer up to one decimal place)"," To find the solubility of hydrogen in Pd at $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm, we can use Henry's law and the given solubility data at $P_(H_2)$ = 1 atm.

First, we need to find the mole fraction of hydrogen in Pd at $P_(H_2)$ = 1 atm. We can use Sievert's law, which relates the mole fraction of hydrogen in the metal to the partial pressure of hydrogen in equilibrium with the metal:

$$x_H = K_P \frac{P_{H_2}}{P_{total}}$$

where $x_H$ is the mole fraction of hydrogen, $K_P$ is the equilibrium constant, $P_{H_2}$ is the partial pressure of hydrogen, and $P_{total}$ is the total pressure (which is 1 atm in this case).

We are given that $x_H$ = 1.64 * $10^(4)$ $mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd at $P_{H_2}$ = 1 atm. We can rearrange Sievert's law to find $K_P$:

$$K_P = \frac{x_H}{P_{H_2}} = \frac{1.64 \times 10^4}{1} = 1.64 \times 10^4 \frac{mm^3}{kg\cdot atm}$$

where $S$ is the solubility (in $mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd), $x_H$ is the mole fraction of hydrogen, and $M_Pd$ is the molar mass of Pd (which is 106.4 g/mol).

We can find $x_H$ using Henry's law:

$$x_H = K_P \cdot P_{H_2}$$

$$x_H = (1.64 \times 10^4) \cdot (0.09) = 1.476 \times 10^4 \frac{mm^3}{kg\cdot atm}$$

Explanation:

A diamagnetic material has a negative magnetic susceptibility because it tries to expel the applied magnetic field from itself, not because its magnetic moments are aligned in the opposite direction to the applied field. The misconception that diamagnetic materials have positive susceptibility may arise from the fact that the magnetization vector in a diamagnetic material points in the opposite direction to the applied field, but the susceptibility itself is a measure of the material's response to the applied field, not the direction of the magnetization vector.

An antiferromagnetic material, on the other hand, has a negative magnetic susceptibility due to the cancellation of the magnetic moments of neighboring spins, resulting in a net magnetic moment of zero or very close to zero.

Therefore, statements (ii) and (iii) are true.

Statement (i) is false because diamagnetic materials have a negative magnetic susceptibility, not a positive one.

Statement (iv) is true because paramagnetic materials have a positive magnetic susceptibility due to the alignment of their magnetic moments in the direction of the applied magnetic field.",,,0,

H = NiI / l
H = (150)(I) / 0.25

The saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_(3)O_(4)$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons ($µ_B$) will be ? Ignore contribution from orbital magnetic moments. ,"To calculate the saturation magnetic moment of $Fe\_3O\_4$, we need to determine the effective number of Bohr magnetons ($n\_B$) for each type of ion (Fe and O) and then multiply it by the number of ions in a formula unit and their magnetic moments.

First, let's find the effective number of Bohr magnetons for Fe and O ions based on their electronic configuration:

For Fe$^{2+}$ ion:
- Configuration: (1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s$^2$ 3p$^6$ 3d$^6$)
- Hund's rules: S = 2, L = 2, J = L + S = 4
- Ground state: 5D4
- Effective number of Bohr magnetons: $n\_B$ = 5

For O$^{2-}$ ion:
- Configuration: (1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$)
- Effective number of Bohr magnetons: $n\_B$ = 0

Now, let's find the number of ions in a formula unit of $Fe\_3O\_4$:

- 1/8 of tetrahedral sites are occupied by Fe$^{2+}$ ions: 1/8 * 8 = 1 Fe ion
- 1/2 of the octahedral sites are occupied by Fe$^{2+}$ ions: 1/2 * 8 = 4 Fe ions
- The remaining octahedral sites are occupied by O$^{2-}$ ions: 8 - 1 - 4 = 3 O ions

Finally, we can calculate the saturation magnetic moment of $Fe\_3O\_4$ per formula unit:

$M\_s$ = (Number of Fe ions * Magnetic moment of Fe$^{2+}$ * $n\_B$ of Fe$^{2+}$) + (Number of O ions * Magnetic moment of O$^{2-}$ * $n\_B$ of O$^{2-}$)

$M\_s$ = (1 * 2.2 * 5) + (3 * 0 * 0)
$M\_s$ = 11 * 5 = 55 $µ\_B$

So, the saturation magnetic moment of $Fe\_3O\_4$ per formula unit is 55 Bohr magnetons.",,,0,

(17.1a) in the context) and the relation between saturation magnetization, magnetic moment, and the number of Bohr magnetons (Eq. (17.1b) in the context).

First, we need to convert the lattice parameter from nanometers to Angstroms: 0.2 nm = 0.2 * 10^9 Å = 2 * 10^7 Å.

Next, we can calculate the saturation magnetization using Eq. (17.1a) in the context:

M(0) = μB / (a³) = μB / (2 * 10^7 Å³)

We are given that M(0) = 600 kA/m = 600 * 10^3 A/m = 6 * 10^5 A/cm² = 6 * 10^5 * 10^4 cm³/m³ = 6 * 10^9 A/cm³.

Now, we can calculate the net magnetic moment per atom using Eq. (17.1b) in the context:

μB = M(0) * a³ = 6 * 10^9 A/cm³ * (2 * 10^7 Å³) = 6 * 10^9 A/cm³ * (2 * 10^7 * 10^10 Å³/cm³) = 6 * 10^16 A·m²/kg

Since 1 Bohr magneton = 9.27 * 10^-21 J·T·s²/kg = 1.3996 * 10^-23 J/T, we can convert the magnetic moment to Bohr magnetons:

μB = 6 * 10^16 A·m²/kg * (1.3996 * 10^-23 J/T) / (1.6021 * 10^-13 J·C) = 1.105 * 10^27 J·T·s²/kg = 1.105 * 10^27 * 9.27 * 10^-21 J·T·s²/kg = 1.02 * 10^5 * 9.27 * 10^-21 J·T = 9.75 * 10^4 * 9.27 * 10^-21 J·T = 9.09 * 10^4 * 10^-23 J·T = 8.85 * 10^4 * 10^-23 m²·kg·T = 8.85 * 10^4 * 10^-24 J·T·kg = 8.85 * 10^4 * 10^-24 m²·kg·(J·s²/T) = 8.85 * 10^4 * 10^-24 m²·kg·(kg·m²/s²·A²) = 8.85 * 10^4 * 10^-24 m³·kg

So, the net magnetic moment per atom is approximately 8.85 * 10^-24 m³·kg, which is equivalent to 9.31 * 10^-22 J·T.

(9.23) from the context, which states that the saturation magnetization at high fields and/or low temperatures is given by Ms = NgJ μB. Here, N is the number of Fe atoms per unit volume, g is the gyromagnetic ratio, and μB is the magnetic moment of an Fe atom.

First, we need to find the number of Fe atoms per unit volume. Since the lattice parameter a is given, we can calculate the volume of the unit cell, V = a³, and then find the number of Fe atoms in the unit cell, N = 1/V.

Using the given lattice parameter, a = 0.287 nm = 0.287 × 10⁻⁹ m, we have:

V = a³ = (0.287 × 10⁻⁹ m)³ = 0.112 × 10⁻⁶ m³

N = 1/V = 1/(0.112 × 10⁻⁶ m³) = 8.95 × 10²⁵ m⁻³

Now, we can calculate the saturation magnetization using Eq. (9.23):

Ms = NgJ μB = (8.95 × 10²⁵ m⁻³) × (55.85) × (9.273 × 10⁻²⁴ J⁻¹) × (9.273 × 10⁻²⁴ A m²)

Ms = 1.71 × 10⁵ J T⁻¹ = 1.71 × 10⁵ × (1 × 10⁵ J T⁻¹/J T⁻¹) = 1.71 × 10¹⁰ A m⁻¹

To convert the saturation magnetization to kAm-1, we need to multiply it by 10³:

Ms = 1.71 × 10¹⁰ A m⁻¹ × 10³ = 1.71 × 10¹³ A m⁻¹ = 1.71 × 10³ kA

The context describes the different types of magnetic dipole moments and their behavior in magnetic fields, but it does not provide enough information to directly link the figures P, Q, R, and S to specific types of magnetism.

However, we can make some general assumptions based on the context:

* Paramagnetism is a type of magnetism where the magnetic moments of atoms or ions align with an external magnetic field, resulting in a net magnetization.
* Diamagnetism is a type of magnetism where atoms or ions do not have a permanent magnetic moment, but they still respond to an external magnetic field by generating a magnetic moment in the opposite direction.

First, we need to convert the saturation magnetization to magnetic moments per unit volume. We know that the magnetic moment per Bohr magneton is 9.27 × 10^-21 J/T, so we can convert the saturation magnetization to magnetic moments per cubic meter:

1700 kA/m = 1700 × 10^3 A/m = 1.7 × 10^6 J/m^3 = 1.7 × 10^6 × 9.27 × 10^-21 J/Bohr magneton/m^3 = 1.56 × 10^13 Bohr magnetons/m^3

Next, we can find the number of iron atoms per unit volume using the lattice parameter and the Avogadro constant:

1 unit cell = a^3 = (0.287 nm)^3 = 1.12 × 10^-28 m^3
1 mole = 6.022 × 10^23 atoms
1 g-atom = 55.85 g/mol = 5.585 × 10^22 atoms

So the number of iron atoms per unit volume is:

1.12 × 10^-28 m^3 × 6.022 × 10^23 atoms/mol × 5.585 × 10^22 atoms/g-atom = 3.61 × 10^28 atoms/m^3

Now we can find the magnetic moment per iron atom by dividing the magnetic moments per unit volume by the number of iron atoms per unit volume:

Magnetic moment per iron atom = Magnetic moments per unit volume / Number of iron atoms per unit volume
= 1.56 × 10^13 Bohr magnetons/m^3 / 3.61 × 10^28 atoms/m^3
= 4.32 × 10^-21 J/T = 4.32 × 10^-14 Am^2

However, first, we need to find the terminal velocity of the steel ball in the upward moving liquid Al.

The given information:

* Density of steel ball ($ρ_(steel)$) = 7200 kg/$m^(3)$
* Density of liquid Al ($ρ_(Al)$) = 2360 kg/$m^(3)$
* Viscosity of liquid Al ($μ_(Al)$) = 1*$10^(–3)$ Pa.s
* Reynolds number (Re) = 5*$10^(5)$
* Friction factor (f) = 0.2
* Radius of steel ball (R)

We can calculate the velocity of the steel ball using the given equation:

F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2)

We need to find the velocity (v) of the steel ball.

First, let's calculate the buoyant force on the steel ball:

Buoyant force = $ρ_(Al)$ $V$ $g$

Where $V$ is the volume of the steel ball.

Volume of steel ball = $\frac{4}{3}$ $\pi$ $R^3$

Substituting the given values:

Buoyant force = 2360 kg/$m^(3)$ $\frac{4}{3}$ $\pi$ $(0.05)^3$ $g$

Now, let's calculate the weight of the steel ball:

Weight of steel ball = $ρ_(steel)$ $V$ $g$

Substituting the given values:

Weight of steel ball = 7200 kg/$m^(3)$ $\frac{4}{3}$ $\pi$ $(0.05)^3$ $g$

Now, we can find the velocity of the steel ball using the given equation:

F = Weight of steel ball - Buoyant force

F = ($ρ_(steel)$ - $ρ_(Al)$) $V$ $g$

Substituting the given values:

F = (7200 kg/$m^(3)$ - 2360 kg/$m^(3)$) $\frac{4}{3}$ $\pi$ $(0.05)^3$ $g$

Now, we can find the terminal velocity of the fine spherical steel particle in a quiescent liquid Al bath using Stokes' law:

Terminal velocity = 2 $μ_(Al)$ $d\_p$ /($ρ_(Al)$)

Substituting the given values:

Terminal velocity = 2 $1*10^(–3)$ Pa.s $10^(-6)$ m $2360$ kg/$m^(3)$

At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is","To find the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle, we can use the Bernoulli's equation for steady, incompressible flow through a nozzle. The equation is:

h1 + (v1^2/2g) = h2 + (v2^2/2g)

where h1 is the potential energy per unit volume at the upstream (or inlet) of the nozzle, h2 is the potential energy per unit volume at the downstream (or outlet) of the nozzle, v1 is the velocity of the fluid at the inlet, and v2 is the velocity of the fluid at the outlet.

First, we need to find the velocity of the fluid at the inlet (v1). We can use the energy equation for an open system to find the velocity:

Δh = mgh

where Δh is the change in enthalpy, m is the mass of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height difference.

Since the fluid is draining from a vessel, the change in enthalpy is equal to the potential energy of the fluid at the surface of the vessel minus the potential energy of the fluid at the nozzle outlet:

Δh = ρgh1 - ρgh2

where ρ is the density of the fluid.

We can assume that the velocity of the fluid at the surface of the vessel is zero, so h1 = h, the height of the liquid column. We also need to find h2, the height of the fluid at the nozzle outlet.

The height of the fluid at the nozzle outlet can be found by using the Bernoulli's equation:

h1 + (v1^2/2g) = h2 + (v2^2/2g)

We know that h1 = h, so we can rearrange the equation to find v1:

v1 = sqrt(2g(h2 - h))

We also need to find the velocity of the fluid at the outlet (v2). We can use the nozzle discharge coefficient (Cd) to find the velocity:

Cd = Q / (A * sqrt(2g * h))

where Q is the discharge rate, A is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle, and h is the head (or pressure difference) across the nozzle.

We can assume that the discharge rate is equal to the initial mass flow rate divided by the density of the fluid:

Q = m / (ρ * t)

where t is the time.

We can also find the head across the nozzle using the Bernoulli's equation:

h = (v2^2/2g) + h2

We can assume that the velocity of the fluid at the outlet is equal to the velocity of the fluid in the pipe downstream of the nozzle, which can be found using the continuity equation:

A1 * v1 = A2 * v2

where A1 is the cross-sectional area upstream of the nozzle, and A2 is the cross-sectional area downstream of the nozzle.

Now we have enough information to find the initial mass flow rate. Here are the steps:

1. Find the height of the fluid at the nozzle outlet (h2):

h2 = h1 - (v1^2/2g)
h2 = h - (2g * (h2 - h) / g)

Solving for h2:

h2 = (h / 2) + (h / 2) * sqrt(1 + (2 * g * (h2 - h) / h^2))

2. Find the velocity of the fluid at the inlet (v1):

v1 = sqrt(2g * (h2 - h))

3. Find the velocity of the fluid at the outlet (v2):

Cd = Q / (A * sqrt(2g * h))
v2 = sqrt(2g * h) * Cd

4. Find the cross-sectional area downstream of the nozzle (A2):

A2 = A1 * (v1 / v2)

5. Find the initial mass flow rate (m):

m = Q = A2 * ρ * v2

Re = ρ * V * l / μ

We are not given the fluid viscosity μ, but we can assume it for the sake of calculation. Let's assume μ = 0.001 Pa.s.

Now we can calculate the Reynolds number:

Re = 1000 kg/m³ * V * 1 m / 0.001 Pa.s
Re = 1000000 V

We can find the friction factor f' from the Moody chart or empirical equations. For simplicity, let's assume f' = 0.015 for Re < 2000 (laminar flow).

Now we can find the friction factor f:

f = (4 * 0.015) / Re = (4 * 0.015) / 1000000 = 6 * 10⁻⁶

Explanation:

The given equation for the axial velocity $v\_z$ in a fully developed 1-D flow of a Newtonian fluid through a horizontal pipe is:

$$v\_z = \frac{\Delta P}{L} \cdot \frac{R^2 - r^2}{4\mu}$$

We can see that the shear stress $\tau$ exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is given by the partial derivative of the velocity with respect to the radial distance $r$:

$$\tau = -\mu \cdot \frac{\partial v\_z}{\partial r}$$

By differentiating the given equation for $v\_z$ with respect to $r$, we get:

$$\frac{\partial v\_z}{\partial r} = -\frac{1}{2\mu} \cdot \frac{2r}{R^2 - r^2} \cdot \Delta P \cdot \frac{1}{L}$$

Multiplying both sides by $-\mu$ and rearranging, we get:

$$\tau = \mu \cdot \frac{\partial v\_z}{\partial r} = -\frac{\Delta P}{2L} \cdot \frac{r}{R^2 - r^2}$$

Evaluating this expression at the wall ($r = R$), we get:

$$\tau\_{wall} = -\frac{\Delta P}{2L} \cdot \frac{R}{R^2 - R^2} = -\frac{\Delta P}{2L}$$

Explanation:

In an inviscid incompressible fluid, the flow around a non-rotating smooth spherical object is described by the Bernoulli equation, which states that the pressure decreases along a streamline as the fluid velocity increases. Since the flow is fully developed far from the object, the velocity of the fluid is constant and equal to the velocity at point O. Therefore, the velocity of the fluid at point A is not necessarily zero.

However, the flow is deflected around the object due to the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream sides of the sphere. According to the Bernoulli equation, the pressure at any point on a streamline is lower than the pressure at an upstream point if the fluid velocity is higher at that point. Since the fluid velocity is higher on the downstream side of the sphere due to the deflection of the flow, the pressure at that point is lower than the pressure at point O. This pressure difference causes the flow to be deflected around the object.

Therefore, statement (D) is true. The other statements are not necessarily true. The velocity of the fluid at point A may not be zero, and the fluid pressure at point A may not exceed that at point O by the amount 𝜌$v^2$/2. Fluid moving precisely along OA may not turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object, as the flow may be deflected around the object without turning perpendicularly.",,,0,

ρp = 3650 kg/m^3
ρf = 7000 kg/m^3
μ = 6*10^-3 kg/m/s

Substituting the values:

Vt = 2 * 9.81 * (0.00005)^2 * (3650 - 7000) / (18 * 6*10^-3)
Vt = -1.38 * 10^-3 m/s

The negative sign indicates that the particle is actually sinking, not floating. However, we can use the absolute value of the terminal velocity to calculate the time required for the particle to reach the surface.

Time (t) = (2 * r^2 * (ρp - ρf) / (18 * μ))^2 * g^(-1)

Substituting the values:

t = (2 * (0.00005)^2 * (3650 - 7000) / (18 * 6*10^-3))^2 * (9.81)^(-1)
t = 1.15 * 10^11 s

However, this value is not realistic as it is much larger than the age of the universe. This indicates that the assumption of Stokes law behavior is not valid for this system due to the large particle size and the significant difference in densities between the particle and the fluid. In reality, the alumina particles would experience buoyancy forces and turbulence in the molten steel, which would affect their behavior and make it difficult to calculate an accurate time to reach the surface. Therefore, more complex fluid dynamic calculations would be required to accurately model the behavior of the alumina particles in the molten steel during ladle deoxidation.

More complex fluid dynamic calculations are required to accurately model the behavior of the alumina particles in the molten steel during ladle deoxidation.]",,,0,
Fluid,13,G-META-18-45,NUM,75,"Assume Stokes law; i.e., drag force $𝐹_𝑑$ = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣, where 𝜇 is the viscosity of steel. Given: Density of liquid steel = 7900 kg $m^(-3)$ ; Viscosity of liquid steel = 0.0079 Pa s; Density of the inclusion = 2500 kg $m(-3)$ ; Acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m $s^(-2)$. The terminal velocity(in mm$s^(-1)$ to two decimal places) (𝑣) of a spherical inclusion of diameter D = 50 micrometers rising in liquid steel is?","To find the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion using Stokes' law, we need to calculate the drag force and the buoyant force acting on it.

First, let's calculate the drag force:

Drag force $𝐹_𝑑$ = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣

We are given the density of liquid steel $\rho_𝑝$ = 7900 kg $m^(-3)$, viscosity of liquid steel $\mu$ = 0.0079 Pa s, and the diameter of the inclusion $D$ = 50 micrometers = 50 × 10^-6 m.

We need to find the velocity $𝐷𝑣$ to solve for the terminal velocity.

Drag force $𝐹_𝑑$ = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣

Substituting the given values:

$𝐹_𝑑$ = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣

$𝐹_𝑑$ = 3𝜋 × 0.0079 Pa s × 𝐷𝑣

Now, let's calculate the buoyant force:

Buoyant force $𝐹_𝑏$ = $\rho_𝑝$ × $𝐖_𝑏$

Where $𝐖_𝑏$ is the volume of the displaced liquid.

The volume of the sphere is given by:

$𝐖_𝑏$ = $\frac{4}{3}$𝜋$𝑒^3$

Substituting the diameter $D$:

$𝐖_𝑏$ = $\frac{4}{3}$𝜋$(50\times10^{-6})^3$

$𝐖_𝑏$ = $\frac{4}{3}$𝜋$(1.25\times10^{-15})$

$𝐖_𝑏$ = $5.24\times10^{-12}$ m$^3$

Now, let's calculate the buoyant force:

Buoyant force $𝐹_𝑏$ = $\rho_𝑝$ × $𝐖_𝑏$

$𝐹_𝑏$ = 7900 kg $m^(-3)$ × $5.24\times10^{-12}$ m$^3$

$𝐹_𝑏$ = $4.01\times10^{-6}$ N

For equilibrium, the drag force equals the buoyant force:

$𝐹_𝑑$ = $𝐹_𝑏$

Substituting the expressions for drag force and buoyant force:

$3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣$ = $4.01\times10^{-6$ N

Solving for the velocity $𝐷𝑣$:

$𝐷𝑣$ = $\frac{4.01\times10^{-6}}{3𝜋𝜇}$

$𝐷𝑣$ = $\frac{1.33\times10^{-3}}{3𝜋𝜇}$

$𝐷𝑣$ = $\frac{1.33\times10^{-3}}{3\times3.14\times0.0079}$

$𝐷𝑣$ = $\frac{1.33\times10^{-3}}{1.13}$

$𝐷𝑣$ = $1.17\times10^{-3}$ m/s

To convert to mm/s, we need to multiply by 1000:

$𝐷𝑣$ = $1.17\times10^{-3}$ m/s × 1000 mm/m

$𝐷𝑣$ = $1.17\",,,0,

Explanation:

The given context discusses various methods for determining the fracture toughness of ceramics and designing ceramic components safely. It also mentions some problems with ceramics, such as their brittleness and the presence of flaws. However, it does not provide enough information to directly answer the question about which techniques are not applicable for detecting internal flaws in a ceramic material.

However, based on common knowledge in materials science and non-destructive evaluation, we can make an educated guess.

Liquid penetration testing, also known as dye penetration testing, is a method for detecting surface porosity and cracks in materials. It involves applying a liquid penetrant to the surface of the material and observing the penetration of the liquid into any surface-breaking defects. This method is not suitable for detecting internal flaws in a ceramic material because it only tests the surface.

Ultrasonic testing, on the other hand, is a method for detecting internal flaws by sending high-frequency sound waves through the material and observing the reflections from any defects. This method is commonly used for detecting flaws in metals but can also be used for ceramics, albeit with some limitations due to the different properties of ceramics compared to metals.

Radiography and eddy current testing are both methods for detecting internal flaws in metals and other conductive materials. Radiography uses radiation to produce an image of the internal structure of the material, while eddy current testing uses electromagnetic induction to detect changes in the material's electrical conductivity. Neither of these methods is directly applicable to ceramics because they require the material to be electrically conductive, which ceramics are not.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1 and 3. Liquid penetration testing is not applicable for detecting internal flaws in ceramic materials, and ultrasonic testing is applicable but may have limitations due to the different properties of ceramics compared to metals. Radiography and eddy current testing are not applicable because ceramics are not electrically conductive.",,,0,
Material testing,2,G-META-16-23,MCQS,37,"For dye-penetrant test, identify the CORRECT statement  (A) Pre- and post-cleaning of parts are not required (B) Internal defects can be detected (C) Surface oxides helps in crack identification (D) Dye with low contact angle is required","The correct statement for dye-penetrant testing is:

A) Pre- and post-cleaning of parts are required.

Explanation:
The dye-penetrant testing method relies on the capillary action of a liquid penetrant to enter the surface-breaking defects in a material. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the surface of the part to be tested is clean and free from contaminants such as dirt, oil, water, and oxides. Pre-cleaning is necessary to remove any contaminants that may hinder the penetration of the penetrant into the defects. Post-cleaning is required to remove the excess penetrant and developer from the surface, leaving only the penetrant that has been drawn out of the defects.

Therefore, statement A is the correct answer.

The other statements are incorrect:

B) Internal defects cannot be detected.
The dye-penetrant testing method is primarily used for detecting surface-breaking defects. However, it can also detect some types of subsurface defects, such as delaminations or shallow cracks, if the penetrant is able to penetrate deeply enough into the material.

C) Surface oxides do not help in crack identification.
Surface oxides can interfere with the penetration of the penetrant into the defects and make it difficult to detect the cracks. Therefore, it is important to remove any surface oxides before performing the dye-penetrant test.

D) A dye with a low contact angle is not required.
The contact angle of a liquid is the angle at which it meets a solid surface. In the context of dye-penetrant testing, a penetrant with a low contact angle is desirable because it spreads more easily and penetrates into smaller defects more effectively. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.",,,0,

Explanation:

From the context provided, we can infer that:

1. Piezoelectric materials are those in which polarization is induced by the application of external forces.
2. Ferroelectric materials are those in which there is a spontaneous polarization in the absence of external fields.
3. Pyroelectric materials are those in which a change in temperature results in the generation of an electric field.

Therefore, we can see that:

(i) All piezoelectric materials are not necessarily ferroelectric because some piezoelectric materials, like quartz, do not have spontaneous polarization and are referred to as ""non-ferroelectric piezoelectrics.""

(ii) All ferroelectric materials are not necessarily piezoelectric because some ferroelectric materials, like barium titanate and lead zirconate titanate, exhibit a piezoelectric effect when subjected to an external field.

(iii) All pyroelectric materials are necessarily piezoelectric because the pyroelectric effect is a special case of the piezoelectric effect where the external field is a temperature gradient.

(iv) All pyroelectric materials are not necessarily ferroelectric because some pyroelectric materials, like tourmaline and quartz, do not have spontaneous polarization and are not ferroelectric.

Miscellaneous,3,G-XEC-2019-1,MCQS,30,On decreasing the objective aperture size in an optical microscope  (A) the spherical aberration increases (B) the depth of field increases (C) the diffraction-limited resolution increases (D) the astigmatism increases,"(A) the spherical aberration decreases

Explanation:

Decreasing the objective aperture size in an optical microscope reduces the angle subtended by the lens at the object, which in turn reduces the spread of rays traveling from the object to the image plane. This decrease in the spread of rays helps to minimize spherical aberration, which is a type of aberration that arises due to the variation in focal length as a function of the distance of a beam from the center of the lens. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.

However, it is important to note that decreasing the objective aperture size also conflicts with the requirement of having a large value of the semiangle (α) to optimize resolution. Therefore, a balance is required for optimum resolution, which is achieved when αopt ~ (λ/Cs)1/4.

Assuming activity equals concentration, the minimum pH at which $Fe^(+3)$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is?(answer up to two decimals places)","To find the minimum pH at which $Fe^{3+}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$, we need to use the solubility product expression and the given concentration of $Fe^{3+}$.

Given:
[Fe³⁺] = 1 × 10⁻³ M
Ksp(Fe(OH)₃) = 1 × 10⁻³⁹

Solubility product expression:
[Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = Ksp

Assuming activity equals concentration:
[OH⁻] = [OH⁻]₀ + [Fe(OH)₃] × α(Fe(OH)₃)

Since we're assuming activity equals concentration, we can use the given concentration of $Fe^{3+}$ to find the concentration of $OH⁻$.

[OH⁻] = [OH⁻]₀ + [Fe³⁺] × (1)

[OH⁻] = [OH⁻]₀ + 1 × 10⁻³

[OH⁻] = [OH⁻]₀ + 1 × 10⁻³

Now, we can substitute these values into the solubility product expression and solve for the minimum pH.

[Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = Ksp

(1 × 10⁻³)[OH⁻]³ = 1 × 10⁻³⁹

[OH⁻]³ = 1 × 10⁻³⁹ / 1 × 10⁻³

[OH⁻]³ = 1 × 10⁻³⁹

Taking the logarithm of both sides:

3 log[OH⁻] = log(1 × 10⁻³⁹)

3 log[OH⁻] = −39.00

log[OH⁻] = −13.00

[OH⁻] = 1 × 10⁻⁴ M

Now, we can calculate the pH using the pH expression:

pH = 14 + log[OH⁻]

pH = 14 + log(1 × 10⁻⁴)

pH = 14 − 4

pH = 10

So, the minimum pH at which $Fe^{3+}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is approximately 10.
