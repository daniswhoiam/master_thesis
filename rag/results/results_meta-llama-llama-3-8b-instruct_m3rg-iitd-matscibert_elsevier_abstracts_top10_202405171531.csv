Material manufacturing;11;G-META-12-10;MCQS;22;Floatation beneficiation is based on the principle of  (A) Mineral surface hydrophobicity (B) Gravity difference (C) Chemical reactivity (D) Particle size difference;"Based on the context, I can provide an answer to the question.

Floatation beneficiation is a process used to separate minerals based on their hydrophobicity (water-repelling properties). The principle behind floatation is that hydrophobic particles (such as minerals like copper, lead, and zinc) will stick to air bubbles and float to the surface, while hydrophilic particles (such as minerals like quartz and feldspar) will remain submerged.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) Mineral surface hydrophobicity";;A;1;

Material manufacturing;12;G-META-12-12;MCQS;15;Which one is NOT an agglomeration process?  (A) Nodulizing (B) Briquetting (C) Roasting (D) Pelletizing;"Based on the context provided, I will analyze the options to determine which one is NOT an agglomeration process.

Agglomeration is the process of converting fine powders or particles into a more convenient form, such as pellets or briquettes, by bonding them together.

Here's how each option relates to agglomeration:

A. Nodulizing: This is an agglomeration process, as it involves converting fine particles into nodules, which are larger, more manageable particles.

B. Briquetting: This is also an agglomeration process, as it involves bonding fine powders or particles together to form larger briquettes.

C. Roasting: Roasting is a thermal process used to improve the quality or appearance of coffee beans or other food products. It is not an agglomeration process, as it does not involve bonding particles together.

D. Pelletizing: This is an agglomeration process, as it involves converting fine powders or particles into pellets.

Correct answer:
C. Roasting";;C;1;
Material manufacturing;13;G-META-12-13;MCQS;20;During LD blow in steelmaking the impurity that gets removed first is  (A) Carbon (B) Phosphorous (C) Manganese (D) Silicon;"Based on the context, I found some information that might be helpful in answering this question. LD (Ladle Furnace) blow is a process in steelmaking where air is blown into the ladle to remove impurities from the steel. The impurities that are typically removed during this process include:

* Carbon dioxide (CO2)
* Hydrogen (H2)
* Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
* Manganese (Mn)
* Carbon (C)

Phosphorus (P), on the other hand, is not typically removed during the LD blow process as it is a refractory element and can form a solid solution with silicon and manganese in the steel.

Silicon (Si) is also not typically removed during the LD blow process as it is a common impurity in steel and is not easily removed through oxidation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Phosphorous";;D;0;
Thermodynamics;44;G-META-12-14;MCQS;44;During the solidification of a pure metal, it was found that dendrites are formed. Assuming that the liquid-solid interface is at the melting temperature, the temperature from the interface into the liquid  (A) Decreases (B) Increases (C) Remains constant (D) Increases and then decreases;"Based on the context, I'll provide an answer.

During the solidification of a pure metal, the temperature of the liquid metal near the solid-liquid interface is at the melting point (Tm). As you move away from the interface into the liquid, the temperature will decrease due to the heat of fusion being released as the metal solidifies.

So, the correct answer is:

(A) Decreases";;A;1;
Atomic structure;44;G-META-12-15;MCQS-NUM;51;A peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern is observed at 2θ = 78°, corresponding to {311} planes of an fcc metal, when the incident beam has a wavelength of 0.154 nm. The lattice parameter of the metal is approximately  (A) 0.6 nm (B) 0.4 nm (C) 0.3 nm (D) 0.2 nm;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation, which relates the wavelength of the incident beam, the angle of diffraction, and the spacing of the lattice planes.

The Bragg equation is:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the incident beam, d is the spacing of the lattice planes, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

We are given that the peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern is observed at 2θ = 78°, which means that the angle of diffraction is θ = 39°. We are also given that the wavelength of the incident beam is λ = 0.154 nm.

The spacing of the lattice planes, d, is given by the lattice parameter, a, and the Miller indices, h, k, and l. For an fcc metal, the lattice parameter is related to the spacing of the {311} planes by:

d = a/√(h² + k² + l²)

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

d = a/√(3² + 1² + 1²) = a/√(9 + 1 + 1) = a/√11

We can now use the Bragg equation to solve for the lattice parameter, a. Rearranging the equation to solve for a, we get:

a = nλ/(2dsin(θ))

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

a = (1)(0.154 nm)/(2d sin(39°))

To solve for a, we need to find the value of d. We can do this by using the fact that the spacing of the {311} planes is given by:

d = a/√(3² + 1² + 1²) = a/√11

Substituting this expression for d into the equation for a, we get:

a = (1)(0.154 nm)/(2(a/√11) sin(39°))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

a = (0.154 nm)/(2 sin(39°)/√11) ≈ 0.286 nm

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 0.3 nm";;B;0;
Atomic structure;45;G-META-12-16;MCQS;34;If d is the inter-planar spacing of the planes {h k l}, the inter-planar spacing of the planes {nh nk nl}, n being an integer, is  (A) d (B) d/n (C) nd (D) d/$n^2$;"Since the planes {h k l} and {nh nk nl} are parallel, their inter-planar spacing is the same. The only difference is the number of lattice planes that are stacked together.

The inter-planar spacing d is the distance between two consecutive lattice planes. If we stack n lattice planes together, the distance between the first and nth plane is still d, because the planes are parallel.

Therefore, the inter-planar spacing of the planes {nh nk nl} is also d.

Correct answer:

* (A) d";;B;0;
Electrical;14;G-META-12-17;MCQS;41;As temperature increases, the electrical resistivities of pure metals ($ρ_m$) and intrinsic semiconductors ($ρ_s$) vary as follows  (A) Both $ρ_m$ and $ρ_s$ increase (B) Both $ρ_m$ and $ρ_s$ decrease (C) $ρ_m$ increases and $ρ_s$ decreases (D) $ρ_m$ decreases and $ρ_s$ increases ;"Based on the context, we can analyze the behavior of electrical resistivity in pure metals and intrinsic semiconductors as a function of temperature.

In pure metals, the electrical resistivity (ρm) typically decreases with increasing temperature due to the increased mobility of electrons. This is because the thermal energy increases the kinetic energy of the electrons, allowing them to move more freely and reducing the scattering of electrons by lattice vibrations (phonons).

In intrinsic semiconductors, the electrical resistivity (ρs) typically increases with increasing temperature due to the increased thermal energy, which excites more charge carriers (electrons and holes) into the conduction band. This increases the number of charge carriers that can contribute to the electrical current, leading to an increase in the electrical resistivity.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) ρm increases and ρs decreases";;C;1;
Thermodynamics;45;G-META-12-18;MCQS;54;At equilibrium spacing in a crystalline solid, which of the following is true for net inter-atomic force (F) and potential energy (U)  (A) F is zero and U is zero (B) F is zero and U is minimum (C) F is minimum and U is zero (D) F is minimum and U is minimum;"Based on the context, I'll provide an answer.

At equilibrium spacing in a crystalline solid, the net inter-atomic force (F) is zero. This is because the attractive forces between atoms are balanced by the repulsive forces, resulting in a net force of zero.

As for the potential energy (U), it is minimum. This is because the equilibrium spacing is the point where the potential energy is at its minimum value. At this point, the atoms are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy, which is a result of the balance between the attractive and repulsive forces.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D) F is minimum and U is minimum";;B;0;
Thermodynamics;46;G-META-12-19;MCQS;26;The property of a material that CANNOT be significantly changed by heat treatment is  (A) Yield strength (B) Ultimate tensile strength (C) Ductility (D) Elastic modulus;"Based on the context and the options provided, I'm going to answer the question as follows:

The property of a material that CANNOT be significantly changed by heat treatment is (D) Elastic modulus.

Here's my reasoning:

* Yield strength (A) can be significantly changed by heat treatment. Heat treatment can alter the microstructure of the material, which can affect its yield strength.
* Ultimate tensile strength (B) can also be affected by heat treatment. For example, increasing the temperature can cause some materials to exhibit a higher ultimate tensile strength.
* Ductility (C) is related to the amount of plastic deformation a material can undergo before breaking. While heat treatment can affect the ductility of some materials, it's not always a guarantee that ductility cannot be changed.
* Elastic modulus (D) is the ratio of stress to strain in the elastic region of a material. It is a fundamental property of a material that is determined by its internal structure and chemistry. Elastic modulus is not significantly affected by heat treatment, which is why it is the correct answer.

Here is the correct list:

• The property of a material that CANNOT be significantly changed by heat treatment is:
• (D) Elastic modulus";;D;1;

A unit dislocation splits into two partial dislocations, and we need to find the correct combination of their Burgers vectors.

The given unit dislocation has a Burgers vector of (a/2)[1 -1 0]. This means that if we move a distance of a/2 along the [1 -1 0] direction, we will close the dislocation.

When a unit dislocation splits into two partial dislocations, the sum of their Burgers vectors must equal the original Burgers vector. This is known as the ""conservation of Burgers vector"".

Let's denote the Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations as b1 and b2. We can write:

b1 + b2 = (a/2)[1 -1 0]

We are looking for the correct combination of b1 and b2, which are given as:

(A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]
(B) (a/6)[1 -1 2] and (a/6)[-1 -2 1]
(C) (a/6)[1 1 -2] and (a/6)[2 -1 -1]
(D) (a/6)[2 1 1] and (a/6)[1 2 -1]

Let's check each option:

(A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] = (a/2)[1 -1 0] ( Correct!)

(B) (a/6)[1 -1 2] + (a/6)[-1 -2 1] ≠ (a/2)[1 -1 0]

(C) (a/6)[1 1 -2] + (a/6)[2 -1 -1] ≠ (a/2)[1 -1 0]

(D) (a/6)[2 1 1] + (a/6)[1 2 -1] ≠ (a/2)[1 -1 0]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]";;A;1;
Mechanical;22;G-META-12-21;MCQS;84;A polymer matrix composite is reinforced with long continuous ceramic fibres aligned in one direction. The Young’s moduli of the matrix and fibres are $E_m$ and $E_f$ respectively, and the volume fraction of the fibres is f. Assuming iso-stress condition, Young’s modulus of the composite $E_C$ in a direction perpendicular to the length of fibres, is given by the expression  (A) $E_C$ = (1-f)$E_m$ + f$E_f$ (B) $E_C$ = f$E_m$ + (1-f)$E_f$ (C) 1/$E_C$ = [(1-f)/$E_m$] + f/$E_f$ (D) 1/$E_C$ = [f/$E_m$] + (1-f)/$E_f$;"To solve this problem, we can use the rule of mixtures, which is a common method for estimating the mechanical properties of composite materials. The rule of mixtures states that the composite's property (in this case, Young's modulus) is a weighted average of the properties of the individual components, where the weights are the volume fractions of the components.

In this case, we are given that the fibers are aligned in one direction, which means that the composite's Young's modulus in a direction perpendicular to the length of the fibers (i.e., the transverse modulus) is the relevant property.

The iso-stress condition means that the fibers and matrix are subjected to the same stress, which is perpendicular to the fibers. This allows us to use the rule of mixtures to estimate the composite's transverse modulus.

The expression for the composite's transverse modulus is:

1/E_C = (1-f)/E_m + f/E_f

This is option (C).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[C] 1/E_C = [(1-f)/E_m] + f/E_f";;C;1;
Material processing;32;G-META-12-22;MCQS;23;Which of the following is NOT a fusion welding process?  (A) Arc welding (B) Gas welding (C) Resistance welding (D) Friction stir welding;"Based on the context, I can answer the question.

Fusion welding processes involve melting the base metal to join two parts together. The options are:

* Arc welding (A): This process uses an electric arc to melt the metal and join two parts together.
* Gas welding (B): This process uses a flame to melt the metal and join two parts together.
* Resistance welding (C): This process uses electrical resistance to generate heat and melt the metal, joining two parts together.

Friction stir welding (D) is a solid-state welding process, meaning it doesn't involve melting the metal. Instead, it uses friction and pressure to join two parts together.

The riser is a part of the casting process that allows for the removal of impurities and gases from the molten metal.

The correct answer is:

(C) After casting solidifies

The riser is designed to allow the melt to solidify after the casting has solidified. This is because the riser is typically located at the top of the casting and is designed to allow any remaining impurities or gases to escape as the metal solidifies. If the riser were to solidify before the casting, it would not be able to effectively remove impurities and gases from the metal.

Here is the correct answer:

Radiography is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to produce images of the internal structures of the body. The principle behind radiography is based on the absorption of X-rays by different materials. X-rays are absorbed by denser materials, such as bone, and pass through less dense materials, such as soft tissues. The absorbed X-rays are detected by a digital detector or film, creating an image of the internal structures.

Thermodynamics;47;G-META-12-33;MCQS-NUM;42;Consider a reaction with activation energy of 8.314 kJ/mol that takes place at 300 K. If the reaction rate is to be tripled, the temperature of the reaction should be  (A) 174.5 K (B) 447.5 K (C) 600.5 K (D) 847.5 K;"To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a reaction to the activation energy (Ea), frequency factor (A), and temperature (T):

k = A \* exp(-Ea / (RT))

where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).

We are given that the reaction rate is to be tripled, so we can set up the following equation:

3k = k

Substituting the Arrhenius equation into this equation, we get:

3A \* exp(-Ea / (RT)) = A \* exp(-Ea / (RT))

Dividing both sides by A \* exp(-Ea / (RT)) gives:

3 = exp(-Ea / (RT))

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(3) = -Ea / (RT)

Now, we can rearrange the equation to solve for T:

T = Ea / (R \* ln(3))

Plugging in the given values:

X(CaO) = (55/56) / 1.834 = 0.3011
X(MgO) = (10/40) / 1.834 = 0.0545
X(Al2O3) = (15/54) / 1.834 = 0.0821
X(SiO2) = (20/60) / 1.834 = 0.1099

Brine quenching  (A) P<Q<R<S (B) Q<R<P<S (C) P<Q<S<R (D) Q<P<R<S;"Based on the context, quenching severity refers to the rate at which a hot metal part cools down. In general, the severity of quenching increases as the cooling rate increases.

Here's the ranking from least severe to most severe:

1. P. Oil quenching: Oil has a relatively low thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, which means it cools the metal at a slower rate.
2. Q. Water quenching: Water has a higher thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity than oil, which results in a faster cooling rate.
3. S. Brine quenching: Brine (a solution of water and salt) has an even higher thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity than water, resulting in an even faster cooling rate.
4. R. Water quenching with agitation: Agitating the water while quenching increases the convective heat transfer, which further increases the cooling rate.

(A) Higher the amount of cold work, lower is the recrystallization temperature (B) Higher the recovery, higher is the recrystallization temperature (C) Higher the temperature of cold work, higher is the recrystallization temperature (D) Finer the initial grain size, higher is the recrystallization temperature;"Based on the context, I'll analyze the options:

(A) Higher the amount of cold work, lower is the recrystallization temperature: This is correct. Cold work introduces defects and dislocations in the material, which reduces the energy required for recrystallization, resulting in a lower recrystallization temperature.

(B) Higher the recovery, higher is the recrystallization temperature: This is correct. Recovery is the process of removing defects and dislocations from the material, which increases the energy required for recrystallization, resulting in a higher recrystallization temperature.

(C) Higher the temperature of cold work, higher is the recrystallization temperature: This is correct. Higher temperatures during cold work can lead to more extensive recovery, resulting in a higher recrystallization temperature.

(D) Finer the initial grain size, higher is the recrystallization temperature: This is correct. Finer initial grain sizes require more energy to recrystallize, resulting in a higher recrystallization temperature.

After analyzing the options, I found that none of the statements are incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. Fatigue (P): Fatigue is a phenomenon where a material becomes weak and fails due to repeated loading and unloading. This is often attributed to the accumulation of micro-cracks and damage at the grain boundaries. Therefore, the matching mechanism is:
   P - 2. Slip band extrusion and intrusion

2. Creep (Q): Creep is a phenomenon where a material deforms slowly over time under constant stress. This is often attributed to the movement of dislocations and the formation of new dislocations. Therefore, the matching mechanism is:
   Q - 4. Dislocation interaction

3. Strain hardening (R): Strain hardening is a phenomenon where a material becomes stronger and more resistant to deformation as it is deformed. This is often attributed to the formation of new dislocations and the interaction between dislocations. Therefore, the matching mechanism is:
   R - 4. Dislocation interaction

4. Yield point phenomenon (S): Yield point phenomenon is a phenomenon where a material exhibits a sudden drop in stress as it yields. This is often attributed to the formation of new dislocations and the interaction between dislocations. Therefore, the matching mechanism is:

Mechanical;24;G-META-12-44;MCQS-NUM;42;Fracture stress for a brittle material having a crack length of 1 µm is 200 MPa. Fracture stress for the same material having a crack length of 4 µm is  (A) 200 MPa (B) 150 MPa (C) 100 MPa (D) 50 MPa;"Based on the context, it appears that the question is related to the concept of fracture mechanics and the effect of crack length on the fracture stress of a brittle material.

The Griffith theory states that the fracture stress of a material with a crack is given by:

σ = σ0 / √(1 + 2Eγa/πr^2)

where σ is the fracture stress, σ0 is the fracture stress of the material without a crack, E is the Young's modulus, γ is the surface energy, a is the crack length, and r is the radius of the material.

From the question, we know that the fracture stress for a brittle material with a crack length of 1 µm is 200 MPa. We can use this information to find the fracture stress for the same material with a crack length of 4 µm.

Let's plug in the values:

σ0 = 200 MPa (given)
a = 1 µm
a' = 4 µm (new crack length)

Using the Griffith theory, we can write:

σ' = σ0 / √(1 + 2Eγa'/πr^2)

Since the material is brittle, we can assume that the surface energy γ is constant. We can also assume that the Young's modulus E and the radius r are constant.

To simplify the equation, we can divide both sides by σ0:

σ'/σ0 = 1 / √(1 + 2Eγa'/πr^2)

Now, we can plug in the values:

σ'/σ0 = 1 / √(1 + 2Eγ(4/1)πr^2)

Since the crack length has increased by a factor of 4, the fracture stress will decrease by a factor of √(1 + 2Eγ(4/1)πr^2). This factor is less than 1, so the fracture stress will decrease.

The correct answer is:

(B) 150 MPa";;C;0;

The flow stress (σ) is given by the equation σ = 100* $(ε)^(0.1)$ MPa, where ε is the strain rate.

To find the strain rate (ε), we need to find the strain (ε) first. The strain (ε) is given by the equation ε = (ΔL/L0), where ΔL is the change in length and L0 is the initial length.

In this case, the initial diameter is 10 cm and the final diameter is 5 cm, so the change in length (ΔL) is given by:

ΔL = π(10^2 - 5^2) = 75π cm

The initial length (L0) is given by:

L0 = π(10^2) = 100π cm

So, the strain (ε) is given by:

ε = (ΔL/L0) = (75π/100π) = 0.75

Now, we can find the strain rate (ε) by taking the derivative of the strain (ε) with respect to time (t):

ε = dε/dt = d(0.75)/dt = 0

Since the strain rate (ε) is zero, the flow stress (σ) is given by:

σ = 100* $(0)^(0.1)$ MPa = 100 MPa

So, the correct answer is (B) 105 MPa.";;B;1;

Assertion (a) states that front tension and/or back tension are employed to decrease rolling load during rolling.

Reason (r) states that roll pressure decreases due to lowering of flow stress as a result of front tension/back tension.

After analyzing, I can conclude that:

* Assertion (a) is TRUE. Front tension and/or back tension are indeed used to decrease rolling load during rolling.
* Reason (r) is also TRUE. The lowering of flow stress as a result of front tension/back tension does contribute to a decrease in roll pressure, which in turn helps to reduce the rolling load.

The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball. The force exerted on the steel ball is  (A) 8.32 N (B) 6.70 N (C) 1.67 N (D) 0.52 N;"To solve this problem, we need to identify the given values and plug them into the formula for the force (F) exerted on the steel ball.

Given values:

* Density of steel: ρ_(steel) = 7200 kg/m^3
* Density of liquid Al: ρ_(Al) = 2360 kg/m^3
* Velocity of liquid Al: v = unknown (needs to be determined)
* Radius of steel ball: R = unknown (needs to be determined)
* Friction factor: f = 0.2
* Viscosity of liquid Al: μ_(Al) = 1 × 10^(-3) Pa.s

First, we need to determine the velocity of the liquid Al. The Reynolds number is given as:

Re = 5 × 10^5

We can rearrange the formula for the Reynolds number to get:

Re = ρ_(Al) v R / μ_(Al)

Substituting the given values and solving for v, we get:

v = (Re × μ_(Al)) / (ρ_(Al) R)
v = (5 × 10^5 × 1 × 10^(-3)) / (2360 × R)

Now that we have v, we can calculate the radius of the steel ball using the given densities:

R = √(ρ_(steel) / ρ_(Al))
R = √(7200 / 2360)
R ≈ 0.525 m (approximately)

Now that we have R and v, we can calculate the force (F) exerted on the steel ball:

F = f π R^2 (ρ_(Al) v^2 / 2)
F = 0.2 π (0.525)^2 ((2360) (v)^2 / 2)

The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball.

The terminal velocity of a particle is the velocity at which the force exerted by the fluid on the particle is equal to the weight of the particle. In this case, the force exerted by the fluid on the steel ball is given by the equation:

F = f π R^2 (ρ_Al v^2 /2)

where f is the friction factor, R is the radius of the steel ball, ρ_Al is the density of the liquid Al, and v is the velocity of the liquid Al.

The weight of the steel ball is given by:

W = m g

where m is the mass of the steel ball and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Since the steel ball is in equilibrium, the force exerted by the fluid on the steel ball is equal to the weight of the steel ball. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

F = W

Substituting the expressions for F and W, we get:

f π R^2 (ρ_Al v^2 /2) = m g

Rearranging the equation to solve for v, we get:

v = sqrt(2 g m / (f π R^2 ρ_Al))

The terminal velocity of the steel ball is given by:

v_t = sqrt(2 g m / (f π R^2 ρ_Al))

Substituting the given values, we get:

v_t = sqrt(2 * 9.8 * (m / (0.2 * π * (d_p / 2)^2 * 2360)))

We are given the values of τ, τ0, and k, and we need to find the value of d. Rearranging the equation to solve for d, we get:

d = (√(k / (τ - τ0)))^2

Plugging in the given values, we get:

d = (√(0.10 MN/m^(1.5) / (100 MN/m^2 - 0.10 MN/m^(1.5))))^2

Now, calculate the yield strength:
σy = 100,000,000 Pa + (100,000 Pa√m / √0.00025 m)
σy ≈ 100,000,000 Pa + 1,118,000 Pa

Sulphate formation from metal sulphide concentrates occurs through the reaction:

Metal sulphide (MS) + O2 → Metal oxide (MO) + SO2

In a roasting process, the conditions that favour sulphate formation are:

* High temperature (P): This increases the rate of reaction and helps to decompose the metal sulphide into its oxide and sulphur dioxide.
* High partial pressure of oxygen (Q): This provides the necessary oxygen for the reaction to occur.
* Use of excess air (R): This ensures that there is sufficient oxygen available for the reaction to proceed.

High partial pressure of SO3 (S) is not a necessary condition for sulphate formation, as it is not a reactant in the reaction.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) P, Q and R";;C;0;

High top pressure in a blast furnace operation:

* (A) favours the solution-loss reaction: This is correct. Solution loss occurs when the slag forms a layer on top of the furnace, which can lead to the loss of valuable metals. High top pressure helps to prevent this by pushing the slag back down into the furnace, reducing the likelihood of solution loss.

* (B) suppresses the solution-loss reaction: This is incorrect. High top pressure actually favours the solution-loss reaction, not suppresses it.

* (C) decreases gas-solid contact time: This is incorrect. High top pressure can actually increase gas-solid contact time by pushing the gas upwards, allowing for more efficient contact between the gas and the solid particles.

* (D) increases coke rate: This is incorrect. High top pressure can actually decrease the coke rate by reducing the amount of coke required to maintain the desired temperature and operation.

(A) favours the solution-loss reaction";;B;0;

The permeability of burden in an ironmaking blast furnace refers to the ease with which gases can flow through the furnace. This is important because it affects the overall efficiency and productivity of the furnace.

From the options, I would choose:

(D) Pulverized coal injection through the tuyeres

Pulverized coal injection (PCI) is a common practice in ironmaking blast furnaces to improve permeability. By injecting pulverized coal into the furnace through the tuyeres, the coal particles react with the hot gases to form a more porous and permeable burden, allowing for better gas flow and improved furnace performance.

Risers are used in casting to allow for the escape of gases and to prevent porosity in the casting. They are typically used in castings that have a high volume of molten metal and a large amount of shrinkage.

Among the options, risers are not required for casting:

* Stainless steel: Stainless steel is a type of steel alloy that is resistant to corrosion and has a high melting point. It can be cast without risers.
* Plain carbon steel: Plain carbon steel is a type of steel alloy that is commonly used in construction and manufacturing. It can also be cast without risers.
* White cast iron: White cast iron is a type of cast iron that has a high carbon content and is known for its high strength and durability. It can be cast without risers.

Grey cast iron, on the other hand, is a type of cast iron that has a lower carbon content than white cast iron and is more prone to shrinkage and porosity. As a result, risers are often used in the casting of grey cast iron to allow for the escape of gases and to prevent porosity.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D) white cast iron";;C;0;

Given values:

* Current (I) = 200 A
* Voltage (V) = 20 V
* Welding speed (v) = 0.01 m/s

Plugging in the values, we get:

HI = (200 x 20) / (0.01 x 1000)

Atomic structure;52;G-META-13-29;MCQS-NUM;30;A unit cell of an element has maximum linear density along the [110] direction. The packing density of its (100) plane is  (A) 0.68 (B) 0.74 (C) 0.79 (D) 0.91;"Since the unit cell has maximum linear density along the [110] direction, it implies that the atoms are packed most densely along this direction.

The (100) plane is a plane that lies perpendicular to the [100] direction. Since the atoms are packed most densely along the [110] direction, the (100) plane will have a packing density that is lower than the packing density along the [110] direction.

The packing density of a plane is given by the ratio of the area of the plane occupied by atoms to the total area of the plane. Since the (100) plane is a square plane, the packing density can be calculated as follows:

Packing density = (Area of atoms in the plane) / (Total area of the plane)

Since the atoms are packed most densely along the [110] direction, the atoms in the (100) plane will be arranged in a square lattice with a side length of √2 times the atomic radius. This means that the area of the plane occupied by atoms will be:

Area of atoms in the plane = √2 × atomic radius × √2 × atomic radius = 2 × atomic radius^2

The total area of the plane is simply the area of the square plane, which is:

Total area of the plane = (side length)^2 = (2 × atomic radius)^2 = 2 × atomic radius^2

Therefore, the packing density of the (100) plane is:

Packing density = (2 × atomic radius^2) / (2 × atomic radius^2) = 0.68

In a binary system, the miscibility gap occurs when the two components (A and B) are immiscible, meaning they don't mix together. This happens when the intermolecular forces between molecules of the same type (A-A or B-B) are stronger than the intermolecular forces between molecules of different types (A-B).

The condition for miscibility is given by the following inequality:

ε_AB > ½ (ε_AA + ε_BB)

This means that the energy of the A-B bond (ε_AB) must be greater than half the sum of the energies of the A-A and B-B bonds (ε_AA + ε_BB).

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) ε_AB > ½ (ε_AA + ε_BB) - This is the correct condition for miscibility, so it's not the answer.

(B) ε_AB < ½ (ε_AA + ε_BB) - This is the opposite of the correct condition, so it's not the answer.

(C) ε_AB = ½ (ε_AA + ε_BB) - This is a special case where the A-B bond energy is equal to half the sum of the A-A and B-B bond energies. In this case, the system is not necessarily immiscible, so it's not the answer.

(D) ε_AB < ¼ (ε_AA + ε_BB) - This is an even weaker condition than option B, so it's not the answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. There are 150 gearwheels in total.
2. 112 gearwheels are within the required tolerance.
3. 21 gearwheels are below the required tolerance.
4. The rest of the gearwheels (150 - 112 - 21 = 17) are above the required tolerance.

We want to find the probability of randomly selecting a gearwheel below the tolerance and then a second one above the tolerance.

For the first selection, the probability of selecting a gearwheel below the tolerance is:

P(first gearwheel below tolerance) = Number of gearwheels below tolerance / Total number of gearwheels
= 21/150
= 0.14

For the second selection, we are left with 149 gearwheels (150 - 1 = 149), and we want to select one that is above the required tolerance. The number of gearwheels above the required tolerance is 17.

P(second gearwheel above tolerance) = Number of gearwheels above tolerance / Total number of gearwheels remaining
= 17/149
= 0.114

To find the combined probability, we multiply the probabilities of the two events:

P(combined) = P(first gearwheel below tolerance) × P(second gearwheel above tolerance)

The yield strength of this metal (in MPa) having a grain size of 36 µm is  (A) 110 (B) 125 (C) 140 (D) 165;"Based on the given information, we can conclude that the yield strength of the metal increases as the grain size decreases. This is because the yield strength is 145 MPa when the grain size is 25 µm, which is smaller than the grain size of 36 µm.

Using this information, we can estimate the yield strength of the metal when the grain size is 36 µm. Since the yield strength increases as the grain size decreases, we can expect the yield strength to be lower when the grain size is 36 µm, which is larger than 25 µm.

The yield strength is 100 MPa when the grain size is 64 µm, which is larger than 36 µm. Therefore, we can expect the yield strength to be higher than 100 MPa but lower than 145 MPa when the grain size is 36 µm.

a = (2γE)^(1/2)

We are given that the maximum internal crack length (a) is 8 µm, and we need to find the estimated theoretical fracture strength (σ). According to the Griffith theory, the fracture strength is related to the surface energy and Young's modulus by the following equation:

σ = (2γE)^(1/2) / πa

We are given that Young's modulus (E) is 400 GPa, and surface energy (γ) is 3.14 J/m². We can convert the surface energy from J/m² to Pa by multiplying it by 1e6 (since 1 J = 1e6 Pa):

γ = 3.14 J/m² × 1e6 Pa/J = 3.14e6 Pa

Now we can plug in the values into the equation for σ:

σ = (2 × 3.14e6 Pa × 400e9 Pa)^(1/2) / π × 8e-6 m
= (2.52e11 Pa)^(1/2) / π × 8e-6 m

M = (μ × N) / V

where M is the saturation magnetization, μ is the magnetic moment per atom, N is the number of atoms per unit volume, and V is the volume of a single atom.

Given the lattice parameter (0.2 nm), we can calculate the volume of a single atom:

V = (4/3) × π × (0.2 nm)^3 = 0.524 × 10^-23 cm^3

We are also given the saturation magnetization (600 kA/m). We can convert this to units of A/m:

600 kA/m = 600,000 A/m

Now we can plug in the values:

600,000 A/m = (μ × N) / (0.524 × 10^-23 cm^3)

To solve for μ, we need to know the number of atoms per unit volume (N). For an FCC metal, the number of atoms per unit volume is:

N = (1 / (a^3)) × (4/3) × π

where a is the lattice parameter. Plugging in the value:

N = (1 / (0.2 nm)^3) × (4/3) × π ≈ 5.66 × 10^22 atoms/cm^3

Now we can plug in the values:

600,000 A/m = (μ × 5.66 × 10^22 atoms/cm^3) / (0.524 × 10^-23 cm^3)

Let's break it down:

1. The roll has a diameter of 720 mm, so the effective width of the roll is the circumference of the roll, which is:

Circumference = π × radius = π × (720 mm / 2) = approximately 2280 mm

2. The slab is 480 mm thick, so the width of the slab is the diameter of the roll minus twice the thickness of the slab:

Width of slab = 720 mm - 2 × 480 mm = approximately 1200 mm

3. The coefficient of friction is 0.5, which means that for every 1 mm of deformation, the roll will slip by 0.5 mm.

4. To find the maximum possible reduction, we need to find the maximum possible deformation (since the roll slips by half the deformation). We can use the formula:

Maximum possible reduction (in mm) = 0.5 × (Width of slab in mm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Maximum possible reduction (in mm) = 0.5 × 1200 mm ≈ 600 mm

However, this is too high. The problem states that the slab thickness is 480 mm, so the maximum possible reduction can't exceed the slab thickness. Therefore, the maximum possible reduction is equal to the slab thickness:

Maximum possible reduction (in mm) = 480 mm

Given: standard reduction potential for $Sn^(2+)$ + $2*e^(-1)$ → Sn is -0.136 V versus SHE; $p_(H_2)$ = 1 atm   (A) Sn undergoes oxidation (B) $H^(+)$ undergoes reduction (C) $Sn^(2+)$ undergoes reduction (D) No net reaction";"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the reduction potential of the reaction and compare it to the standard reduction potential of the Sn^(2+) + 2*e^(-1) → Sn reaction.

The given reaction is:

Sn + 2H^(+) = Sn^(2+) + H2

We can write the reduction half-reaction as:

H^(+) + e^(-1) = 1/2H2

The reduction potential of this half-reaction can be calculated using the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)

where E° is the standard reduction potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

Given that pH = 5, the concentration of H^(+) is:

[H^(+)] = 10^(-5) M

The reaction quotient Q is:

Q = [H2]/([H^(+)]^2)

Since the pressure of H2 is 1 atm, the concentration of H2 is:

[H2] = 1 atm / (0.08206 L·atm/mol·K \* 298 K) = 0.00417 M

Substituting the values, we get:

Q = 0.00417 M / (10^(-5) M)^2 = 4.17 x 10^4

Now, we can calculate the reduction potential:

E = -0.136 V - (8.314 J/mol·K \* 298 K / (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)) \* ln(4.17 x 10^4)
= -0.136 V - (0.0257 V) \* ln(4.17 x 10^4)
= -0.136 V - 0.144 V
= -0.280 V

Since the reduction potential of the reaction is more negative than the standard reduction potential of the Sn^(2+) + 2*e^(-1) → Sn reaction, the reaction will not occur spontaneously.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Fluid;12;G-META-13-47;NUM;61;[Given: density of steel = 7000 kg/$m^3$ , density of alumina = 3650 kg/$m^3$ , viscosity of steel = 6*$10^(-3)$ kg/m/s]. Ladle deoxidation of liquid steel is done at 1600°C by adding ferro-aluminium. By assuming Stokes law behaviour, time (in s) required for alumina particles of 50 µm diameter to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be?;"To solve this problem, we need to use Stokes' law, which relates the terminal velocity of a particle to its diameter, density, and the density and viscosity of the surrounding fluid.

The terminal velocity (v) of a particle can be calculated using the following formula:

v = (2 \* ρ_p \* g \* r^2) / (9 \* η \* ρ_f)

where:
ρ_p = density of the particle (alumina)
ρ_f = density of the fluid (steel)
g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2)
r = radius of the particle (50 µm = 0.025 mm)
η = viscosity of the fluid (steel)

First, we need to calculate the radius of the particle:

r = 0.025 mm = 0.025/1000 m = 0.000025 m

Next, we need to calculate the terminal velocity:

v = (2 \* 3650 kg/m^3 \* 9.8 m/s^2 \* (0.000025 m)^2) / (9 \* 6 \* 10^-3 kg/m*s \* 7000 kg/m^3)

v ≈ 0.00043 m/s

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for the particle to float to the surface. We can do this by using the following formula:

t = distance / velocity

t = 2 m / 0.00043 m/s

t ≈ 4630 s

Therefore, the time required for the alumina particles to float to the surface is approximately 4630 seconds.

G-P zones refer to Guinier-Preston zones, which are small, coherent precipitates that form in certain aluminum-copper (Al-Cu) alloys. These zones are coherent because they have the same crystal structure as the surrounding matrix.

The given equation for ΔH^(mix) is:

ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn)

We are asked to find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing (ΔH^(mix)_i) for Cu. The partial molar enthalpy of mixing is defined as the derivative of the integral enthalpy of mixing with respect to the mole fraction of the component being considered.

In this case, we want to find ΔH^(mix)_Cu, which is the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu. To do this, we can take the derivative of ΔH^(mix) with respect to χ_(Cu):

ΔH^(mix)_Cu = (∂ΔH^(mix)/∂χ_(Cu)) = -19250 * χ_(Zn)

Assuming regular solution behaviour, the solution parameter (in J/mol) is  (A) -19250 (B) -9625 (C) 13.75 (D) 2315.4;"Since the context doesn't provide any specific information, we can analyze the given equation:

ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn)

In regular solution theory, the solution parameter (also known as the interaction parameter) is given by:

Ω = RTχ

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and χ is the interaction parameter.

We can rearrange the equation to solve for χ:

χ = Ω / (RT)

Since we are given the equation for ΔH^(mix), we can substitute it into the equation for χ:

χ = (-19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn)) / (RT)

To find the solution parameter (Ω), we can multiply both sides by RT:

Ω = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn) * RT

Now, we can simplify the expression:

Ω = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn) * RT

Comparing this expression with the options, we can see that:

The Burgers vector is a measure of the displacement of the atoms in the lattice due to the dislocation.

In an edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is perpendicular to the dislocation line and parallel to the slip plane. The magnitude of the Burgers vector is equal to the distance between the two sets of atoms on either side of the dislocation.

Given that the atomic diameter of iron is 0.25 nm, we can assume that the distance between the two sets of atoms on either side of the dislocation is also 0.25 nm. Therefore, the modulus of the Burgers vector is:

where E is the energy of the dislocation, G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector (which is equal to the atomic diameter in this case), and ν is Poisson's ratio.

Given the values:

G = 70 GPa = 70 × 10^9 Pa
b = 0.25 nm = 0.25 × 10^-9 m

The microstructure of the quenched steel sheet consists of  (A) fully martensite (B) proeutectoid ferrite + martensite (C) martensite + pearlite (D) martensite + austenite;"Based on the context, we can analyze the question as follows:

* The steel sheet is heated and equilibrated in the inter-critical region, which means it is heated above the lower critical temperature (Ac1) and below the upper critical temperature (Ac3). This region is where both ferrite and austenite are present.
* The steel sheet is then instantaneously quenched in water, which means it is rapidly cooled to prevent any further transformation of the microstructure.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that the microstructure of the quenched steel sheet will consist of:

* Martensite: This is because the rapid cooling prevents the formation of pearlite, and the steel is not cooled slowly enough to allow for the formation of bainite.
* Austenite: This is because the steel was heated in the inter-critical region, where both ferrite and austenite are present.

For a given material, the true stress-true strain curve is expected to be different from the engineering stress-engineering strain curve.

Here's why:

* True stress is the actual stress within the material, accounting for changes in volume due to plastic deformation.
* True strain is the actual strain measured along the fixed reference points, also accounting for changes in volume.

In contrast, engineering stress is the total applied force normalized by the original cross-sectional area, while engineering strain is the change in length normalized by the original length. However, engineering stress and strain do not account for changes in volume.

Therefore, the true stress-true strain curve will not lie exactly along the engineering stress-engineering strain curve. Instead:

* The true stress-true strain curve will lie **above** and to the **left** of the engineering stress-engineering strain curve.

Here's a brief overview of the factors that affect phosphorus removal:

* Higher FeO (iron oxide) level in slag: FeO helps to react with phosphorus and remove it from the steel. Therefore, a higher FeO level in the slag is desirable.
* Higher basicity: Basicity refers to the ratio of calcium oxide (CaO) to silicon dioxide (SiO2) in the slag. A higher basicity helps to promote the reaction between FeO and phosphorus, making it more effective for phosphorus removal.
* Temperature: Temperature affects the kinetics of the reaction between FeO and phosphorus. A higher temperature can enhance the reaction rate, making it more effective for phosphorus removal.

Considering these factors, the correct answer is:

(D) Lower temperature

A lower temperature would slow down the reaction rate, making it less effective for phosphorus removal. Therefore, a higher temperature is more desirable for effective phosphorus removal in the BOF steelmaking process.

(A) Component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from Y (B) Component made from alloy Y can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from X (C) Both can tolerate same flaw size (D) None of the above;"Based on the context, we can analyze the question as follows:

The question states that the $K_{IC}$ (fracture toughness) of alloy X is greater than that of alloy Y. This means that alloy X is more resistant to crack propagation and fracture than alloy Y.

Under Mode I loading, the stress intensity factor $K$ is directly proportional to the stress and the square root of the crack length. Since the stress is the same for both components, the difference in $K_{IC}$ values between the two alloys will affect the crack growth behavior.

Given that alloy X has a higher $K_{IC}$ value, it means that it can tolerate a larger crack size before fracture occurs. This is because the higher $K_{IC}$ value indicates a higher resistance to crack propagation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) Component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from Y

This is because alloy X has a higher $K_{IC}$ value, which means it can withstand a larger crack size before failing, compared to alloy Y.";;A;1;

(A) Reducing carbon content (B) Increasing carbon content (C) Eliminating strong carbide formers (D) Decreasing chromium content;"Based on the context, I'll provide an answer.

Weld decay in austenitic stainless steels is a type of intergranular corrosion that occurs due to the presence of chromium carbides at the grain boundaries. These carbides form when the steel contains carbon and chromium.

To avoid weld decay, the following options can be considered:

* (A) Reducing carbon content: By reducing the carbon content, the formation of chromium carbides can be minimized, which can help prevent weld decay.
* (C) Eliminating strong carbide formers: Some elements like manganese, silicon, and titanium can form carbides more easily than chromium. Eliminating or reducing the content of these elements can help reduce the formation of chromium carbides and prevent weld decay.

The other options are not correct:

* (B) Increasing carbon content: Increasing carbon content can actually increase the likelihood of weld decay by promoting the formation of chromium carbides.
* (D) Decreasing chromium content: Decreasing chromium content can compromise the corrosion resistance of the steel, making it more susceptible to corrosion.

(D) Impurity atoms segregated at grain boundaries can retard grain growth;"Based on the context, I will analyze the options and identify the INCORRECT statement.

Option A: As the average grain size increases, the grain boundary energy per unit area decreases.

This statement is correct. As the grain size increases, the grain boundary area decreases, resulting in a decrease in grain boundary energy per unit area.

Option B: The driving force for grain growth is the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material.

This statement is correct. Grain growth occurs because the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material drives the process.

Option C: Higher the temperature, the faster is the grain growth.

This statement is correct. Grain growth is a thermally activated process, and higher temperatures generally lead to faster grain growth.

Option D: Impurity atoms segregated at grain boundaries can retard grain growth

This statement is correct. Impurities can segregate at grain boundaries and increase the energy of the boundary, making it more difficult for grain growth to occur.

(A) Aluminum wire injection (B) Calcium wire injection (C) Oxygen top blowing (D) Oxygen bottom blowing;"Based on the context, I'm assuming that the question is related to steelmaking and ladle metallurgy. Ladle metallurgy is a process that involves treating molten steel in a ladle to modify its composition and properties.

The options provided are all related to processes that can be used in ladle metallurgy, but only one is specifically related to inclusion modification.

Inclusion modification is a process that involves removing or modifying inclusions (small particles or impurities) in the molten steel to improve its quality and properties. This can be achieved through the injection of certain elements or compounds into the ladle.

Based on this, I believe the correct answer is:

(B) Calcium wire injection

Calcium wire injection is a process that involves injecting calcium-rich wire into the ladle to modify the inclusions in the molten steel. This can help to remove or modify inclusions, such as sulfides and oxides, which can affect the steel's properties.

The correct answer is (C) X-rays.

In a scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-rays are emitted when the high-energy electrons interact with the specimen's atoms. These X-rays are characteristic of the elements present in the specimen and can be used to obtain quantitative elemental analysis.

The other options are not correct:

* (A) Secondary electrons are used for imaging and topographic information, but not for elemental analysis.
* (B) Backscattered electrons are used for imaging and compositional contrast, but not for elemental analysis.
* (D) Transmitted electrons are used for imaging and diffraction, but not for elemental analysis.

If the height of the green sample was 12 mm, then the fill height of powder (in mm) would have been?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The apparent density of the metal powder is given as 2.5 g/cm³. This means that the powder has a mass of 2.5 grams per cubic centimeter.
2. The green density of the compacted powder is given as 5.5 g/cm³. This means that the compacted powder has a mass of 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter.
3. The height of the green sample is given as 12 mm. We need to find the fill height of the powder, which is the height of the powder before compaction.
4. Since the green density is higher than the apparent density, the powder must have been compacted to a smaller volume. This means that the fill height of the powder must be greater than the height of the green sample.

Let's use the formula for density to relate the mass and volume of the powder:

Density = Mass / Volume

We can rearrange this formula to solve for volume:

Volume = Mass / Density

We know the mass of the powder (5.5 g/cm³) and the density of the powder (2.5 g/cm³). We can plug these values into the formula to find the volume of the powder:

Volume = 5.5 g/cm³ / 2.5 g/cm³ = 2.2 cm³

Since the height of the green sample is 12 mm, we can convert this to cubic centimeters:

12 mm = 0.012 m = 0.012 L = 12 mL = 0.012 cm³

Since the volume of the powder is 2.2 cm³, the fill height of the powder must be greater than 0.012 cm³. Let's call the fill height ""x"" cm³. We can set up the following equation:

x cm³ = 2.2 cm³

To find the fill height in millimeters, we can multiply the fill height in cubic centimeters by 1000 (since there are 1000 mm in 1 m):

x mm = x cm³ × 1000 = 2.2 cm³ × 1000 = 2200 mm

So, the fill height of the powder is 2200 mm.";;26.3 TO 26.5;0;

The true strain is given as 0.405, which is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the initial length. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

ε = ln(Lf/L0)

where Lf is the final length and L0 is the initial length.

Given that the change in gauge length is 5 mm, the initial gauge length (L0) is the same as the final gauge length minus the change in gauge length:

L0 = Lf - 5

We can rewrite the true strain equation as:

0.405 = ln(Lf/(Lf - 5))

To solve for Lf, we can use a calculator or software to find the value of Lf that satisfies the equation. After solving, we get:

Lf ≈ 12.18 mm

So, the final gauge length of the specimen is approximately 12.18 mm.

What is the activity of Q in an alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6 at the same temperature?;"To solve this problem, we need to use the given equation to find the activity coefficient of Q, and then use the definition of activity to find the activity of Q.

The given equation is:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(𝑥_R)^2$ - 0.2*$(𝑥_R)^3$

We are given that $𝑥_R$ = 0.6, so we can plug this value into the equation to find the activity coefficient:

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(0.6)^2$ - 0.2*$(0.6)^3$
= $0.6*(0.36)$ - 0.2*$(0.216)$
= $0.216$ - 0.0432
= $0.1728$

Now, we can use the definition of activity to find the activity of Q:

$𝑎_𝑄$ = $𝛾_𝑄$ * $x_𝑄$

We are given that $x_𝑄$ = 1 - $x_R$ = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. We can plug this value into the equation to find the activity:

$𝑎_𝑄$ = $0.1728$ * $0.4$
= $0.06912$

So, the activity of Q in an alloy of composition $x_R$ = 0.6 at the same temperature is approximately 0.06912.

(C) the same weight fractions of the liquid and the solid. (D) different compositions and weight fractions of the liquid;"To solve this problem, we can use thelever rule and the concept of liquidus and solidus temperatures. Let's consider the two Cu-Ni alloys:

1. Alloy 1 with 47 wt.% Ni:
   - The liquid composition will be less Ni-rich than the alloy composition (since the density of Ni is greater than Cu).
   - The weight fraction of the liquid will be relatively low.
2. Alloy 2 with 53 wt.% Ni:
   - The liquid composition will be more Ni-rich than the alloy composition (since the density of Ni is greater than Cu).
   - The weight fraction of the liquid will be relatively high.

Since the two alloys have the same temperature $T_1$ between the liquidus and solidus, the liquid compositions must be the same. Otherwise, the alloys would not be in equilibrium at the same temperature.

On which plane do these two partial dislocaitons lie?  (A) (-1 1 1) (B) (1 1 1) (C) (1 -1 1) (D) (1 1 -1);"To solve this question, we need to understand the given equation and its context.

The equation (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] represents the dissociation of a dislocation into two partials in an FCC metal, where (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1] are the two partial dislocations.

Now, the question asks us to identify the plane on which these two partial dislocations lie. To do that, we need to calculate the normal vector of the plane.

The normal vector of a plane can be calculated using the cross product of two vectors that lie on the plane. In this case, the two vectors are (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1].

After calculating the normal vector, we can write it in the form (nx, ny, nz), where (n) represents the magnitude of the normal vector.

After calculating the normal vector, we need to simplify it to write it in the form (A) (B) (C) (D), which are all the options given for the correct answer.

Let's calculate the normal vector using the cross product of the two given vectors:

normal vector = (2/6)[2 -1 1] x (1/6)[1 -2 -1]
normal vector = [(2/6)(1 -2) - (2/6)(-1 -1) 0]/2
normal vector = (1/12)[-4 + 3 0]

To simplify the normal vector, we can express it in the form (nx, ny, nz):

normal vector = [(1/12)[-4/3, 1/3, 0]

1. The fuel is pure CH4, which means it consists only of methane (CH4).
2. The combustion reaction of methane is:

CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O

This reaction requires 2 moles of oxygen (O2) to combust 1 mole of methane (CH4).
3. The given volume of fuel is 100 m3 at STP, which means it contains:

100 m3 × (1 mole CH4 / 22.4 L) = 4.46 moles CH4

Since the fuel is pure CH4, this is the number of moles of methane that need to be combusted.
4. To combust 4.46 moles of CH4, we need:

4.46 moles CH4 × 2 moles O2 / 1 mole CH4 = 8.92 moles O2

of oxygen.
5. Since air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen, the volume of oxygen in air is:

21 vol.% × 100 m3 = 21 m3

6. To find the volume of air required for complete combustion, we need to convert the moles of oxygen to volume at STP:

8.92 moles O2 × (22.4 L / 1 mole O2) = 199.5 L

Since the volume is given in m3, we need to convert it:

199.5 L × (1 m3 / 1000 L) = 0.1995 m3

However, this is the volume of oxygen in air, not the total volume of air. To find the total volume of air, we need to add the volume of nitrogen (which is 79 vol.% of air):

0.1995 m3 × (100 / 21) = 0.9524 m3

So, the theoretical requirement of air (in m3 at STP) for the complete combustion of 100 m3 (at STP) of a fuel consisting of pure CH4 is:

What is the absolute value of the cell potential (in millivolts) at 25°C, given that copper is divalent? Faraday constant is 96500 C/mol and the universal gas constant is 8.314 J/(mol.K).;"To solve this problem, we can use the following formula for the cell potential:

E_cell = (RT/F) \* ln(a_anode / a_cathode)

Where R is the universal gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, and a_anode and a_cathode are the activities of the anode and cathode, respectively.

Given that the activity of copper in the anode alloy is 0.8, and the activity of pure copper is 1, the difference in activity is:

Δa = a_anode - a_cathode = 0.8 - 1 = -0.2

Substituting this into the formula, we get:

E_cell = (RT/F) \* ln(|Δa/a_anode|)

First, we need to convert the temperate to Kelvin: 25°C = (25 + 273.15) K = 298.15 K

Then, we can plug in the values:

E_cell = (8.314 J/(mol.K)) \* (96500 C/mol) ^-1 \* ln(|-0.2/0.8|)
= (8.314 J/(mol.K)) \* (96500 C/mol) ^-1 \* ln(1.25)
= 0.0616 V

The maximum shear stress (τ) can be calculated using the following formula:

τ = (σ1 - σ3) / 2

where σ1 is the maximum principal stress, σ3 is the minimum principal stress, and σ2 is the intermediate principal stress.

In this case, the principal stresses are 250 MPa, 50 MPa, and -50 MPa. The maximum principal stress (σ1) is 250 MPa, the minimum principal stress (σ3) is -50 MPa, and the intermediate principal stress (σ2) is 50 MPa.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

τ = (250 - (-50)) / 2 = 150 MPa

Assertion (a): Deoxidation and decarburisation of liquid steel are done by vacuum treatment process.

Reason (r): Decreased partial pressure of CO(g) promotes deoxidation and decarburisation.

The vacuum treatment process is used to remove impurities such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon from the liquid steel. Deoxidation is the process of removing oxygen from the steel, and decarburisation is the process of removing carbon. The vacuum treatment process can achieve this by reducing the partial pressure of CO(g), which is a key factor in deoxidation and decarburisation.

Therefore, both the assertion and reason are true. The vacuum treatment process is used for deoxidation and decarburisation, and the decreased partial pressure of CO(g) promotes these processes.

But, I can still try to solve the problem based on the given information.

Chvorinov's rule states that the solidification time (t) is proportional to the square of the thickness (x) of the solidified layer. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

t ∝ x^2

Rearranging the equation to solve for x, we get:

x ∝ √t

Since the thickness of the solidified layer after 2 minutes is 3 cm, we can write:

3 cm ∝ √2 minutes

Now, we need to find the thickness of the solidified layer after 4 minutes. We can use the same proportionality:

x ∝ √4 minutes

To find the thickness, we can substitute the value of the square root of 4 minutes, which is:

x ∝ √4 = 2√2

Since the original thickness was 3 cm, we can scale up the thickness by the same proportion:

x = 3 cm × 2√2

(A) a is true but r is false (B) a is false but r is true (C) both a and r are true, and r is the reason for a (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a;"Based on the given context, we can analyze the assertion and reason to determine their correctness.

Assertion (a) states that the peak aging time for an Al-4 wt.% Cu alloy is indicated by a maximum in the hardness. This is likely correct, as peak aging is a condition where the alloy exhibits the highest hardness due to the formation of the θ precipitates and the resulting solid solution strengthening.

Reason (r) states that the maximum volume fraction of the θ precipitates is formed at the peak aging time. This is also likely correct, as the θ precipitates are a critical component of the aging process, and the maximum volume fraction would correspond to the peak aging time.

Using this analysis, we can conclude that both the assertion and reason are true, and the reason (r) is the reason for the assertion (a). Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) a is true but r is false (B) a is false but r is true (C) both a and r are true, and r is the reason for a (D) both a and r are true, but r is not the reason for a;"Based on the given context, I'll analyze the question.

Assertion (a): During welding of aluminium alloys by the gas tunglen arc welding process, direct current reverse polarity (DCRP) mode is used.

Reason (r): DCRP facilitates breaking up of the oxide film on the workpiece surface.

According to welding practices, DCRP (Direct Current Reverse Polarity) is typically used for welding aluminum alloys using Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) process. This is because DCRP helps to:

1. Reduce the strong arc blow caused by the reactive aluminum oxide (Al2O3) film on the workpiece surface.
2. Prevent the arc from floating or wandering excessively.
3. Enhance the welding process stability and control.

So, the assertion (a) is true. However, it's essential to note that the reason behind using DCRP is not solely to break up the oxide film, but rather for the benefits mentioned above.

Mechanical;73;G-META-14-49;NUM;49;The flow curve of an annealed metal is expressed as 𝜎 = $200𝜀^(0.25)$ , where σ is in MPa. If a rod of this metal is subjected to a true strain of ε = 0.3 by extrusion, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (in MJ/$m^3$) is;"To solve this problem, we need to find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W) by integrating the flow curve from ε = 0 to ε = 0.3.

The flow curve is given as σ = 200ε^(0.25), where σ is in MPa. We can rewrite this equation as:

σ = 200(10^(-0.25ε))

The ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W) is given by:

W = ∫σ dε

Substituting the expression for σ, we get:

W = ∫200(10^(-0.25ε)) dε

To evaluate this integral, we can use the substitution u = 10^(-0.25ε), which gives du/dε = -0.25(10^(-0.25ε)) = -0.25u. This allows us to rewrite the integral as:

W = -400 ∫u^(-1) du

W = -400 ln|u| + C

where C is the constant of integration. To evaluate C, we can use the boundary condition that W = 0 when ε = 0. This gives:

0 = -400 ln|u| + C

C = 400 ln|u| = 400 ln|1| = 0

So, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W) is:

W = -400 ln|u|

Substituting u = 10^(-0.25ε), we get:

W = -400 ln|10^(-0.25ε)|

W = 400 ln|10^(0.25ε)|

W = 400(0.25ε) ln10

W = 100ε ln10

Now, we can evaluate W for ε = 0.3:

W = 100(0.3) ln10

W = 30 ln10

W ≈ 30(2.302) ≈ 68.06 MJ/m^3

Therefore, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W) is approximately 68.06 MJ/m^3.

(D) $(𝜇_𝑥)^𝛼 = $(𝜇_𝑦)^𝛼 and $(𝜇_𝑥)^𝛽 = $(𝜇_𝑦)^𝛽

The reason is that the chemical potential (µi) of a component in a phase j is a measure of its tendency to moves from high-concentration to low-concentration regions. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the chemical potential of a component in one phase is equal to the chemical potential of the same component in the other phase. Therefore, the correct condition for equilibrium is that the chemical potentials of component x in phases α and β are equal, as well as the chemical potentials of component y in phases α and β.

The important factors for producing low silicon pig iron in a blast furnace are:

* Lower temperature: Silicon is more easily removed from the iron at lower temperatures.
* Higher basicity: Basicity refers to the amount of calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO) present in the slag. A higher basicity helps to remove silicon from the iron by forming a more stable slag.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

What is the change in the enthalpy of pure iron (in J/mol) when it is heated from 25°C to 700°C?;"Let's break down the problem step by step!

1. We are given the specific heat capacity (Cp) of pure iron as a function of temperature (T) in the form:

Cp = 17.49 + 24.77 * 10^(-3) * T

2. We are asked to calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) when pure iron is heated from 25°C to 700°C.

3. To find the change in enthalpy, we can use the formula:

ΔH = ∫[Cp(T) dT] from initial temperature to final temperature

Since we are given the specific heat capacity as a function of temperature, we can substitute it into the formula as:

ΔH = ∫[17.49 + 24.77 * 10^(-3) * T dT] from 298 K to 973 K

4. To evaluate the integral, we can break it up into two parts:

ΔH = ∫[17.49 dT] from 298 K to 973 K + ∫[24.77 * 10^(-3) * T dT] from 298 K to 973 K

5. For the first part, we can evaluate the integral directly:

∫[17.49 dT] from 298 K to 973 K = 17.49 * (973 - 298) = 7.255 J/mol

6. For the second part, we can use integration by parts:

∫[24.77 * 10^(-3) * T dT] from 298 K to 973 K = (24.77 * 10^(-3)) * [(1/2) * (973^2 - 298^2)] = 3.215 J/mol

7. Finally, we can find the total change in enthalpy by adding the two parts:

ΔH = 7.255 J/mol + 3.215 J/mol = 10.47 J/mol

So, the correct answer is:

* ΔH = 10.47 J/mol

Note: The specific heat capacity is given in J/mol.K, but since we are asked to find the change in enthalpy, we need to multiply the specific heat capacity by the temperature range and integrate with respect to temperature.";;22380 TO 22480;0;

The elastic moduli of the glass fibre and the epoxy matrix are 72.5 and 2.4 GPa, respectively. What is the elastic modulus of this composite along the fibre direction, in GPa? The densities of glass fibre and epoxy are $2.58 g/cm^3$ and 1.14 $g/cm^3$, respectively.;"To solve this problem, we can use the rule of mixtures, which states that the elastic modulus of a composite material is the weighted average of the elastic moduli of the individual components, where the weights are the volume fractions of the components.

First, we need to calculate the volume fraction of the glass fibre. We are given the weight fraction of the glass fibre, which is 0.6. We can calculate the volume fraction by dividing the weight fraction by the density of the glass fibre:

Volume fraction of glass fibre = Weight fraction of glass fibre / Density of glass fibre
= 0.6 / 2.58 g/cm^3
= 0.232

The volume fraction of the epoxy matrix is therefore:

Volume fraction of epoxy matrix = 1 - Volume fraction of glass fibre
= 1 - 0.232
= 0.768

Now we can calculate the elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction using the rule of mixtures:

Elastic modulus of composite = Volume fraction of glass fibre x Elastic modulus of glass fibre + Volume fraction of epoxy matrix x Elastic modulus of epoxy
= 0.232 x 72.5 GPa + 0.768 x 2.4 GPa
= 16.83 GPa + 1.84 GPa
= 18.67 GPa

Therefore, the elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction is approximately 18.67 GPa.

Additionally, the question is incomplete, as it does not provide the necessary information to calculate the initial gauge length of the specimen.

However, if the question is asking for the initial gauge length of the specimen, and the strain rate is given as 5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$, and the crosshead speed is 6 mm/min, we can use the formula:

Strain rate = (Crosshead speed / Initial gauge length)

Rearranging the formula to solve for the initial gauge length, we get:

Initial gauge length = Crosshead speed / Strain rate

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Initial gauge length = 6 mm/min / (5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$)

Initial gauge length = 1200 mm

However, this is not a realistic value for the initial gauge length of a tensile specimen. The initial gauge length is typically measured in millimeters or centimeters, not meters.

* $D_(GB)$ represents the diffusion coefficient along grain boundaries, which is a less ordered and more disordered structure than the lattice.
* $D_S$ represents the diffusion coefficient along free surfaces, which is the most disordered and dynamic structure.

Considering these differences, we can conclude that:

* $D_L$ is typically the smallest, as the lattice is the most ordered and rigid structure, making it more difficult for species to diffuse through it.
* $D_(GB)$ is usually larger than $D_L$, as grain boundaries are less ordered and more disordered than the lattice, allowing for easier diffusion.

When boron (trivalent) is doped to silicon, it replaces a silicon atom in the crystal lattice, creating an acceptor impurity. This means that the boron atom has one fewer electron than a silicon atom, creating a hole (a positively charged gap) in the valence band.

However, I must point out that there is no context provided, which makes it challenging to answer the question accurately. Orowan dislocation bypass is a phenomenon that occurs in materials science, and the stress required for it depends on various factors such as the material properties, temperature, and microstructure.

Without any additional information, it's difficult to provide a specific answer. However, I can try to provide a general explanation of the Orowan dislocation bypass mechanism and how it might be affected by changes in interprecipitate spacing.

Orowan dislocation bypass occurs when a dislocation (a line defect in the crystal lattice) encounters a precipitate (a small particle of a different phase) and is forced to bypass it. The stress required for this bypassing process depends on the size and shape of the precipitate, as well as the material properties.

If the interprecipitate spacing is reduced, it's likely that the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass would increase. This is because the dislocation would need to exert more force to bypass the precipitates, which are now closer together.

Based on this general understanding, I would estimate that the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass would increase as the interprecipitate spacing decreases. However, without specific values for the material properties and microstructure, it's difficult to provide a precise answer.

Here is the list with the correct answer:

* The stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass is likely to increase as the interprecipitate spacing decreases.

Creep resistance in polymers refers to the ability of the material to resist deformation over time under constant stress. In epoxies, creep resistance can be enhanced by:

* Increasing the cross-link density (B): Cross-links are chemical bonds that connect polymer chains together. Increasing the cross-link density can improve the material's resistance to creep by making it more difficult for the polymer chains to slide past each other.

The other options are not correct:

* Increasing the bulkiness of side groups (A) may actually decrease creep resistance, as bulkier side groups can make the polymer more prone to deformation.
* Addition of plasticizers (C) can decrease creep resistance, as plasticizers can reduce the material's stiffness and increase its flexibility.
* Annealing (D) is a process that involves heating a material to relieve internal stresses, but it is not directly related to creep resistance.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

* (B) increasing the cross-link density.";;B;1;

Given $∆𝐻°_(298)$ = 172000 joules per mole of $CO_2$, which of the following conditions will favour the forward reaction?  (A) Increasing both temperature and pressure. (B) Decreasing temperature and increasing pressure. (C) Decreasing both temperature and pressure. (D) Increasing temperature and decreasing pressure.;"To determine which condition will favor the forward reaction, we need to analyze the reaction:

C(s) + CO2(g) ⇋ 2CO(g)

The reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat energy. The enthalpy change (ΔH°) is positive, indicating that energy is required to drive the reaction forward.

The reaction is also favored by increasing the concentration of the reactants and decreasing the concentration of the products. Since CO2 is a reactant and CO is a product, increasing the pressure will favor the forward reaction.

Temperature also plays a role in the reaction. Since the reaction is endothermic, increasing the temperature will increase the kinetic energy of the molecules, making it more difficult for the reaction to occur. Therefore, decreasing the temperature will favor the forward reaction.

Combining these factors, we can conclude that:

* Increasing pressure (favoring the forward reaction)
* Decreasing temperature (favoring the forward reaction)

The correct answer is:

(B) Decreasing temperature and increasing pressure.";;D;0;

The equilibrium ratio, $𝑝_(C0_2)$/ $𝑝_(CO)$ for the reaction at 1200 K and 1 atm is ?;"To solve this problem, we can use the equilibrium constant expression, which is given by:

where K is the equilibrium constant, ΔG° is the standard free energy change, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Given the values:

ΔG° = -8000 J/mol
R = 8.314 J/mol·K
T = 1200 K

We can plug these values into the equation:

K = e^(-8000 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K × 1200 K))

The iron ore charged into the furnace contains 95% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ and the rest is gangue. Assume that all the iron in the ore goes to hot metal. The amount of iron ore (in kg) required for producing 1000 kg of hot metal is ?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The hot metal contains 95% Fe, which means it contains 0.95 x 1000 kg = 950 kg of Fe.
2. The atomic weight of Fe is 56 g/mol, so the mass of Fe in 1 mole is 56 g. The mass of Fe in 950 kg is:
950 kg x (1000 g/kg) = 950,000 g
Divide by the atomic weight of Fe to find the number of moles of Fe:
950,000 g / 56 g/mol = 16,964 mol
3. Since all the iron in the ore goes to hot metal, the number of moles of Fe in the ore is the same as the number of moles of Fe in the hot metal:
16,964 mol
4. The iron ore contains 95% Fe2O3, which means it contains 0.95 x 16,964 mol = 16,044 mol of Fe2O3.
5. The atomic weight of Fe2O3 is 160 g/mol, so the mass of Fe2O3 in 1 mole is 160 g. The mass of Fe2O3 in 16,044 mol is:
16,044 mol x 160 g/mol = 2,567,040 g
6. The mass of gangue in the iron ore is the difference between the total mass of the iron ore and the mass of Fe2O3:
Total mass of iron ore = 2,567,040 g (from step 5)
Mass of Fe2O3 = 2,567,040 g (from step 5)
Mass of gangue = Total mass of iron ore - Mass of Fe2O3 = 2,567,040 g - 2,567,040 g = 0 g (since all the iron in the ore goes to hot metal, there is no gangue)
7. The mass of iron ore required for producing 1000 kg of hot metal is the same as the mass of iron ore required for producing 950 kg of hot metal (since the hot metal contains 95% Fe). Therefore, the answer is:
2,567,040 g / 1000 kg = 2567.04 kg

In electrolytic refining of Ni, the anode is Cu-10 atom % Ni and the cathode is pure Ni. Assuming the Cu-Ni solution to be ideal, the ABSOLUTE value of the minimum voltage (in mV) required for refining is?;"To solve this problem, we can start by using the Nernst equation, which relates the electrode potential to the concentrations of the reactants and products. The Nernst equation is given by:

E = E° - RT/nF

where E is the electrode potential, E° is the standard electrode potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and F is the Faraday constant.

In this problem, we are given the information that the anode is Cu-10 atom % Ni, which means that the concentration of Ni ions is 0.1 M, and the concentration of Cu ions is 0.9 M. We are also given the information that the cathode is pure Ni, which means that the concentration of Ni ions is 1 M.

The reaction at the anode is:
Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻

The reaction at the cathode is:
Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Ni

The standard electrode potentials for these reactions are:
E°(Cu²⁺/Cu) = +0.34 V
E°(Ni²⁺/Ni) = -0.25 V

To find the minimum voltage required for refining, we can use the Nernst equation for the anode and cathode separately:

Anode side:
E_anode = E°_anode - RT/nF
= 0.34 - (8.314 J/molK)(300 K)/(96490 C/mol)(2 C/mol)
≈ 1.04 V

Cathode side:
E_cathode = E°_cathode - RT/nF
= -0.25 - (8.314 J/molK)(300 K)/(96490 C/mol)(2 C/mol)
≈ -0.17 V

The minimum voltage required for refining is the difference between the anode and cathode potentials:

ΔE = E_anode - E_cathode
= 1.04 V - (-0.17 V)
≈ 1.21 V

Since the question asks for the absolute value of the minimum voltage, we can take the absolute value of ΔE:

|ΔE| = 1.21 V

Simplifying the equation, we get:

X_A = X_B

On the other hand, if the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K, the free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for solidification is ?;"Let's analyze the given information:

* The melting point of the metal is 1356 K.
* When the liquid metal is undercooled to 1256 K, the free energy change for solidification (ΔG^(L→S)) is -1000 J/mol.

We can use the following equation to relate the free energy change to the temperature:

ΔG^(L→S) = ΔH^(L→S) - TΔS^(L→S)

where ΔH^(L→S) is the enthalpy change for solidification, T is the temperature, and ΔS^(L→S) is the entropy change for solidification.

Since the metal is undercooled to 1256 K, which is below its melting point, the free energy change for solidification is negative, indicating that solidification is spontaneous.

We can rearrange the equation to solve for ΔH^(L→S):

ΔH^(L→S) = ΔG^(L→S) + TΔS^(L→S)

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔH^(L→S) = -1000 J/mol + (1256 K) × ΔS^(L→S)

Now, we need to find the free energy change for solidification when the liquid metal is undercooled to 1200 K. We can use the same equation:

ΔG^(L→S) = ΔH^(L→S) - TΔS^(L→S)

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔG^(L→S) = -1000 J/mol + (1200 K) × ΔS^(L→S)

Since the temperature is lower than the previous case, the free energy change for solidification will be more negative. This means that the solidification will be more spontaneous at 1200 K than at 1256 K.

To find the exact value of ΔG^(L→S) at 1200 K, we need to know the value of ΔS^(L→S). However, since we are asked to find the free energy change in J/mol, we can simply subtract the free energy change at 1256 K from the free energy change at 1200 K:

ΔG^(L→S) = -1000 J/mol - [(1256 K - 1200 K) × ΔS^(L→S)]

Simplifying, we get:

ΔG^(L→S) = -1000 J/mol - 56 K × ΔS^(L→S)

Since the free energy change is more negative at 1200 K, the value of ΔG^(L→S) will be more negative than -1000 J/mol.

We can use Fick's law of diffusion to relate the diffusivity (D) to the time (t) required to achieve a certain extent of homogenization. The equation is:

x^2 = 2Dt

where x is the distance over which homogenization occurs.

We are given that it takes 10 hours to homogenize the alloy at 1273 K, so we can write:

x^2 = 2 × 10^(-19) × 10 × 3600
x^2 = 2.4 × 10^(-14) m^2

Now, we need to find the time required to achieve the same extent of homogenization at 1373 K. We can use the same equation, but with the new diffusivity value:

x^2 = 2 × 10^(-18) × t × 3600

We can equate the two expressions for x^2 and solve for t:

2.4 × 10^(-14) = 2 × 10^(-18) × t × 3600
t = 2.4 × 10^(-14) / (2 × 10^(-18) × 3600)

The volume of the cylindrical billet is given by:

Volume = πr²h

where r is the radius of the billet and h is the height.

We know the height of the billet (1.0 m) and the diameter (0.5 m), so we can find the volume. The diameter is twice the radius, so the radius is:

r = 0.5/2 = 0.25 m

Now, we can find the volume of the billet:

Volume = π(0.25)²(1.0) = 0.3937 m³

The billet is then upset forged to form a pancake, which means the material remains the same, but the shape changes. The volume of the pancake is the same as the volume of the billet.

We know the height of the pancake (0.25 m), and we want to find the diameter. We can use the formula:

Volume = πr²h

where r is the radius of the pancake and h is the height.

We can set up an equation using the volumes of the billet and the pancake:

Assertion: In a pure metal weld, elastic modulus in the heat affected zone (HAZ) is the same as that in the base metal.

Reason: Coarse grained microstructure in the HAZ results in lower hardness.

The elastic modulus is a measure of a material's stiffness, and it is related to the material's microstructure. In a pure metal weld, the HAZ is typically characterized by a microstructure that is different from the base metal, due to the thermal cycles and cooling rates involved in the welding process.

The reason states that a coarse-grained microstructure in the HAZ results in lower hardness. This is true, as a coarse-grained microstructure typically has a lower hardness compared to a fine-grained microstructure.

However, the assertion states that the elastic modulus in the HAZ is the same as that in the base metal. This is not necessarily true. While the elastic modulus is related to the microstructure, it is also influenced by other factors such as the material's composition, defects, and processing history.

1. The metal exits the mould at a rate of 35 kg/s, which means the total mass flow rate is 35 kg/s.
2. The metal consists of a solidified shell with a liquid metal core. Let's assume the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is x. Then, the mass flow rate of solid is 35x kg/s, and the mass flow rate of liquid is 35(1-x) kg/s.
3. The latent heat of fusion is 3 × 10^5 J/kg, which means that the heat required to melt 1 kg of metal is 3 × 10^5 J.
4. The total rate of heat removal by the mould is 4.2 × 10^6 W, which is equivalent to 4.2 × 10^6 J/s.
5. Since the metal is at the melting point, the heat removed by the mould is used to melt the solidified shell. Let's assume the heat removed by the mould is used to melt a mass of solid, Δm, in 1 second. Then, the heat removed by the mould is equal to the latent heat of fusion multiplied by Δm: 3 × 10^5 J/kg × Δm kg = 4.2 × 10^6 J/s.

If the particle size is reduced to $R_2$ = 0.1 $R_1$, the corresponding driving force $∆G_2$ = α $∆G_1$ , where α is;"A questions from my favorite topic: thermodynamics and materials science!

Let's analyze the situation:

The driving force for sintering ($\Delta G_1$) is a measure of the free energy change that drives the reaction between particles. As the particle size decreases, the surface energy contribution to $\Delta G$ increases. Since we're considering spherical particles, the surface energy is proportional to the surface area, which increases with decreasing particle size.

When the particle size decreases to $R_2 = 0.1 R_1$, the surface area increases by a factor of $1/R_2^2$ compared to the original particle size ($R_1$). This increased surface area contributes more to the driving force, which is proportional to the surface energy.

So, the new driving force ($\Delta G_2$) is expected to be larger than the original one ($\Delta G_1$). Since $\Delta G_2$ is a multiple of $\Delta G_1$, we can write:

$$\frac{\Delta G_2}{\Delta G_1} = \alpha$$

We know that the surface energy contribution increases with decreasing particle size, so $\Delta G_2 > \Delta G_1$. Therefore, we can conclude that:

The slope of this line is positive because  (A) ∆S° is positive (B) ∆S° is negative (C) ∆H° is positive (D) ∆H° is negative;"To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of Ellingham diagrams and the factors that affect the slope of the line.

An Ellingham diagram is a plot of the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the oxidation reaction of a metal M as a function of temperature. The reaction is:

xM(s) + O2(g) → MxO2(s)

The slope of this line is related to the change in enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy (ΔS°) of the reaction.

The slope of the line is given by:

d(ΔG°)/dT = ΔS°

Since ΔG° is a function of temperature, the slope of the line represents the change in entropy (ΔS°) with temperature.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) ∆S° is positive: If the entropy change is positive, the slope of the line would be positive, indicating that the entropy of the system increases with temperature. This is a possible scenario.

(B) ∆S° is negative: If the entropy change is negative, the slope of the line would be negative, indicating that the entropy of the system decreases with temperature. This is not a likely scenario, as entropy typically increases with temperature.

(C) ∆H° is positive: The enthalpy change (ΔH°) affects the slope of the line through the term ΔH°/T. If ΔH° is positive, the slope of the line would be positive, but this is not the only factor that determines the slope.

(D) ∆H° is negative: If ΔH° is negative, the slope of the line would be negative, but this is not the only factor that determines the slope.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

(A) ∆S° is positive

The slope of the line in an Ellingham diagram is positive because the entropy change (ΔS°) is positive, indicating that the entropy of the system increases with temperature.";;B;0;

This material has a fracture strength of 300 MPa for a given flaw size. The same solid containing the same flaws is then tested in medium Q in which $𝛾_𝑠$= 0.1 J $m^(-2)$. The fracture strength (in MPa) in medium Q based on Griffith's theory is?;"According to Griffith's theory, the fracture strength (σ) of a brittle material is related to its surface energy (γs) and flaw size (a) by the following equation:

σ = √(2γs / πa)

Given that the material has the same flaw size in both media P and Q, the only difference is the surface energy (γs). We are asked to find the fracture strength in medium Q, where γs = 0.1 J/m².

We are also given the fracture strength in medium P, where γs = 0.9 J/m², which is 300 MPa.

We can use the above equation to find the fracture strength in medium P:

300 MPa = √(2 × 0.9 J/m² / πa)

Now, we can use this equation to find the fracture strength in medium Q:

σ_Q = √(2 × 0.1 J/m² / πa)

Since the flaw size (a) is the same in both media, we can equate the two equations:

300 MPa = √(2 × 0.1 J/m² / πa)

Squaring both sides and solving for σ_Q, we get:

σ_Q = √(2 × 0.1 J/m² / πa) = √(2 × 0.9 J/m² / πa) / √(9) = 300 MPa / 3 = 100 MPa

In a silicate slag, polymerization (network formation) occurs when the oxide addition forms a network of silicate tetrahedra. This happens when the oxide addition has a high field strength, which means it can strongly polarize the oxygen ions and form strong bonds with the silicon ions.

Among the options, the correct answer is:

* (C) $P_(2)O_(5)$

Phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) is a strong oxide that has a high field strength, which allows it to form strong bonds with silicon ions and create a network of silicate tetrahedra. This leads to polymerization and network formation in the silicate slag.

The other options are not correct because:

* CaO (A) is a relatively weak oxide that does not have a high enough field strength to form strong bonds with silicon ions.
* MgO (B) is also a relatively weak oxide that does not have a high enough field strength to form strong bonds with silicon ions.
* Na2O (D) is an alkali oxide that is not capable of forming strong bonds with silicon ions and does not lead to polymerization or network formation in silicate slags.

(C) Silica has a significantly lower melting point than magnesia. (D) Silica is significantly more acidic than magnesia.;"To solve this question, we need to consider the properties of silica and magnesia bricks in relation to high-temperature applications.

Silica bricks are often used for self-supporting arches in furnace roofs because they have a low thermal expansion coefficient. This means that they do not expand significantly when exposed to high temperatures, which is important for maintaining the structural integrity of the arch.

Magnesia bricks, on the other hand, have a higher thermal expansion coefficient, which means they expand more when exposed to high temperatures. This expansion could cause the arch to buckle or collapse, making it unsuitable for use in this application.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures.

r = a/√2

Given that the lattice parameter of face-centered cubic iron (γ-Fe) is 0.3571 nm, we can plug this value into the equation to find the radius of the octahedral void:

The angle (in degrees) between the dislocation line and its Burger’s vector is;"To solve this problem, we need to find the angle between the dislocation line and its Burger's vector.

The Burger's vector is given as (a/2)[1 1 0], which is a vector in the x-y plane. The dislocation line is along the [112] direction, which is a vector in the x-y-z plane.

To find the angle between these two vectors, we need to find the dot product of the two vectors and then take the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result.

First, let's express the Burger's vector and the dislocation line in terms of the lattice parameter a:

Burger's vector: (a/2)[1 1 0] = (a/2)(1i + 1j + 0k)

Dislocation line: [112] = (1/2)(1i + 1j + 2k)

Now, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:

(Burger's vector) · (Dislocation line) = (a/2)(1i + 1j + 0k) · (1/2)(1i + 1j + 2k)
= (a/2)(1 + 1 + 0) + (a/2)(1 + 1 + 0)
= (a/2)(2 + 2)
= a

Now, let's take the inverse cosine of the result:

cos(θ) = a / ||Burger's vector|| ||Dislocation line||
= a / (√(a^2/4 + a^2/4 + 0^2)) (√(1/4 + 1/4 + 4/4))
= a / (√(a^2/2)) (√(6/4))
= 1 / (√2) (√3/2)
= 1 / (√6)

θ = arccos(1 / (√6))

Therefore, the angle between the dislocation line and its Burger's vector is approximately 54.4°.

The correct answer is (A) Dislocation pile-up.

When a metal crystal is plastically deformed at low temperature, the dislocations can become piled up at the grain boundaries or other obstacles, leading to a wavy slip line pattern. This is because the dislocations are unable to move freely due to the low temperature, causing them to accumulate and form a wavy pattern.

Creep resistance is the ability of a material to resist deformation under stress over time. The options are:

(A) Small grain size: A smaller grain size can actually improve creep resistance by reducing the distance that dislocations need to travel to move through the material, making it more difficult for them to accumulate and cause creep.

(B) Fine dispersoid size: Dispersoids are small particles that are dispersed throughout the material. A fine dispersoid size can improve creep resistance by providing additional obstacles for dislocations to overcome, making it more difficult for them to move and cause creep.

(C) Low stacking fault energy: Stacking fault energy is the energy required to create a stacking fault in a material. A low stacking fault energy can actually improve creep resistance by making it more difficult for dislocations to move and accumulate, which can reduce creep.

(D) High melting point: A high melting point is not directly related to creep resistance. Melting point is a measure of a material's thermal stability, and it does not affect its ability to resist creep.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

None of the above.";;A;0;

Here's my reasoning:

* (A) Pre- and post-cleaning of parts are not required: This statement is incorrect. Parts must be thoroughly cleaned before and after testing to ensure the dye can penetrate evenly.
* (B) Internal defects can be detected: This statement is incorrect. The dye-penetrant test only detects external defects or cracks, not internal ones.

The density of the as-pressed aluminium compact is 1755 kg.$m^(-3)$. If the height of the as-pressed compact is 12 mm, the fill height (in mm) required is?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The apparent density of the Aluminium powder is given as 810 kg/m³. This means that the powder has a mass of 810 kg per unit volume of 1 cubic meter.
2. The density of the as-pressed Aluminium compact is given as 1755 kg/m³. This means that the compact has a mass of 1755 kg per unit volume of 1 cubic meter.
3. The height of the as-pressed compact is given as 12 mm. To convert this to meters, we can divide by 1000 (since there are 1000 mm in 1 m): 12 mm / 1000 = 0.012 m.
4. The volume of the as-pressed compact can be calculated using the formula: Volume = Mass / Density. Plugging in the values, we get: Volume = 1755 kg / (1755 kg/m³) = 1 m³.
5. Since the height of the compact is 0.012 m, the radius of the compact can be calculated using the formula: Volume = πr²h. Rearranging the formula to solve for r, we get: r = √(Volume / (πh)). Plugging in the values, we get: r = √(1 m³ / (π × 0.012 m)) = 0.044 m.
6. The fill height required is the height of the compact minus the height of the powder in the die. Since the powder is compacted at 600 MPa, the height of the powder in the die is equal to the height of the compact. Therefore, the fill height required is 0 mm.

Fluid;2;G-META-16-35;NUM;69;Given data: Density of liquid metal = 7000 kg.$m^(-3)$, Nozzle diameter = 30 mm, Nozzle discharge coefficient = 0.80 .The height of a liquid metal column in a cylindrical vessel is 3.2 m. At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The density of the liquid metal is given as 7000 kg/m³.
2. The height of the liquid metal column is 3.2 m.
3. The nozzle diameter is 30 mm = 0.03 m (converting mm to m).
4. The nozzle discharge coefficient is 0.80.

We need to find the initial mass flow rate (in kg/s) through the nozzle.

The mass flow rate (ṁ) can be calculated using the following formula:

ṁ = ρȦ

where ρ is the density of the liquid metal, and Ȧ is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle.

First, let's find the cross-sectional area of the nozzle:

Ȧ = π × (nozzle diameter/2)²
= π × (0.03/2)²
= 4.52 × 10⁻⁴ m²

Now, we can calculate the mass flow rate:

ṁ = ρȦ
= 7000 kg/m³ × 4.52 × 10⁻⁴ m²
= 31.44 kg/s

However, we are asked to find the initial mass flow rate, which is the mass flow rate at time t = 0, when the liquid metal is at its maximum height. At this point, the pressure at the top of the column is atmospheric pressure, and the pressure at the nozzle is the pressure at the bottom of the column, which is also atmospheric pressure.

Since the pressure is the same at both ends, the flow is isobaric, and the mass flow rate is constant. Therefore, the initial mass flow rate is the same as the final mass flow rate.

The nozzle discharge coefficient (0.80) is a dimensionless value that accounts for the losses in the nozzle due to friction, turbulence, and other factors. It is used to correct the theoretical mass flow rate calculated using the nozzle diameter and the pressure difference.

To find the corrected mass flow rate, we can multiply the theoretical mass flow rate by the nozzle discharge coefficient:

ṁ = 31.44 kg/s × 0.80
= 25.15 kg/s

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The chemical composition of DRI is: Total Fe = 92 wt.% and Metallic Fe = 84 wt.%. The weight percent of FeO in DRI is?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Total Fe = 92 wt.% means that the total weight percentage of iron in the DRI is 92%.
2. Metallic Fe = 84 wt.% means that the weight percentage of metallic iron in the DRI is 84%.
3. Since the total Fe is 92%, the remaining 8% must be FeO (iron oxide).

Now, let's calculate the weight percentage of FeO:

Total Fe = 92%
Metallic Fe = 84%

The difference between the two is the weight percentage of FeO:

FeO = Total Fe - Metallic Fe = 92% - 84% = 8%

Therefore, the weight percentage of FeO in DRI is 8%.

If mould length ($L_m$) is 0.8 m and casting speed ($U_c$) is 0.2 $m.s^(-1)$, the average mould flux (in MW.$m^(-2)$) is?;"To find the average mould flux, we need to integrate the mould heat flux (q) with respect to z over the length of the mould (L_m).

First, we need to find the limits of integration. The mould heat flux is zero at the meniscus (z = 0) and at the end of the mould (z = L_m). Therefore, the limits of integration are from 0 to L_m.

The average mould flux (Q_avg) is then given by:

Q_avg = (1/L_m) * ∫[0,L_m] q_m(z) dz

Substituting the expression for q_m(z), we get:

Q_avg = (1/L_m) * ∫[0,L_m] [2.67 - 0.33(z/U_(c))^(0.5)] * 10^6 dz

Evaluating the integral, we get:

Q_avg = (1/L_m) * [(2.67 - 0.33(U_(c)/(U_(c))^(1/2))) * 10^6] * L_m + 0

Simplifying, we get:

Q_avg = (1/L_m) * [2.67 * L_m - 0.33 * U_(c) * (U_(c)/(U_(c))^(1/2)) * L_m] * 10^6

Now, substituting the values given in the problem:

L_m = 0.8 m and U_c = 0.2 m/s

We get:

Q_avg = (1/0.8) * [2.67 * 0.8 - 0.33 * 0.2 * (0.2/(0.2))^(1/2) * 0.8] * 10^6
= (1/0.8) * [2.67 * 0.8 - 0.33 * 0.2 * 1 * 0.8] * 10^6
= (1/0.8) * [2.67 - 0.264] * 10^6

The slag produced during refining contains 40 wt.% CaO and 22 wt.% FeO. Neglecting material losses, the yield of Fe (in %) is?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. 5 metric tons of lime containing 90 wt.% CaO means that the lime contains 4.5 metric tons of CaO (5 x 0.9).
2. The hot metal contains 93.2 wt.% Fe, which means that it contains 93.2/100 x 100 = 93.2 metric tons of Fe.
3. The slag produced contains 40 wt.% CaO, which means that it contains 0.4/0.6 x 5 = 3.33 metric tons of CaO (since the lime contains 5 metric tons and 0.6 is the fraction of CaO in the lime).
4. The slag also contains 22 wt.% FeO, which means that it contains 0.22/0.78 x 100 = 28.2 metric tons of FeO (since the hot metal contains 100 metric tons and 0.78 is the fraction of Fe in the hot metal).
5. Since the slag contains 3.33 metric tons of CaO and 28.2 metric tons of FeO, the total weight of the slag is 3.33 + 28.2 = 31.53 metric tons.
6. The yield of Fe is the amount of Fe in the slag divided by the total weight of the slag, multiplied by 100:

Yield of Fe = (28.2 metric tons of FeO) / (31.53 metric tons of slag) x 100 = 89.5%

At the same temperature, if the pressure is lowered to 0.7 mbar, the equilibrium nitrogen content (in ppm) is?;"To solve this problem, we can use Henry's Law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas.

Given:

* Initial pressure: 1 mbar
* Initial nitrogen content: 14 ppm
* Temperature: 1873 K
* Final pressure: 0.7 mbar

We can set up an equation using Henry's Law:

14 ppm = k × 1 mbar

where k is the Henry's Law constant.

To find the equilibrium nitrogen content at the new pressure, we can use the same equation:

x ppm = k × 0.7 mbar

We can rearrange the equation to solve for k:

k = 14 ppm / 1 mbar

k = 14

Now we can plug in the value of k and the new pressure to find the equilibrium nitrogen content:

Based on mole balance, the relationship applicable to the system at equilibrium is  (A)	$p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$ (B) $p_(Zn)$ = 2*$p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (C) $p_(Zn)$ = $p_(CO)$ + $p_(CO_2)$ (D) $p_(Zn)$ = 0.5*$p_(CO)$ + $2*p_(CO_2)$;"Let's analyze the given reactions:

1. ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g)
2. 2CO(g) = CO2(g) + C(s)

We can write the mole balance for each species:

Zn: ZnO(s) → Zn(g) (moles of Zn increase)
C: C(s) → CO(g) (moles of C decrease)
CO: CO(g) → CO2(g) (moles of CO decrease)
CO2: CO2(g) (no change in moles)
ZnO: ZnO(s) → Zn(g) (moles of ZnO decrease)

Since the reactor is closed, the total number of moles of each species remains constant. Let's denote the initial number of moles of each species as:

n(ZnO) = n0
n(C) = n0
n(Zn) = 0
n(CO) = 0
n(CO2) = 0

After the reaction, the number of moles of each species is:

n(Zn) = n0
n(C) = 0
n(ZnO) = 0
n(CO) = n0
n(CO2) = n0

Now, we can write the mole balance equations:

n(Zn) = n0 (eq. 1)
n(C) = 0 (eq. 2)
n(ZnO) = 0 (eq. 3)
n(CO) = n0 (eq. 4)
n(CO2) = n0 (eq. 5)

We can simplify these equations by dividing each equation by the initial number of moles (n0):

x(Zn) = 1 (eq. 1)
x(C) = 0 (eq. 2)
x(ZnO) = 0 (eq. 3)
x(CO) = 1 (eq. 4)
x(CO2) = 1 (eq. 5)

where x(i) represents the mole fraction of species i.

Now, we can write the equation for the partial pressure of Zn:

p(Zn) = x(Zn) \* Ptotal

where Ptotal is the total pressure of the system.

Substituting the values of x(Zn) and x(CO), we get:

p(Zn) = 1 \* Ptotal

Similarly, we can write the equations for the partial pressures of CO and CO2:

p(CO) = x(CO) \* Ptotal = 1 \* Ptotal
p(CO2) = x(CO2) \* Ptotal = 1 \* Ptotal

Now, we can substitute these expressions into the original options:

(A) p(Zn) = p(CO) + 2 \* p(CO2) → 1 \* Ptotal = 1 \* Ptotal + 2 \* 1 \* Ptotal → False
(B) p(Zn) = 2 \* p(CO) + p(CO2) → 1 \* Ptotal = 2 \* 1 \* Ptotal + 1 \* Ptotal → True
(C) p(Zn) = p(CO) + p(CO2) → 1 \* Ptotal = 1 \* Ptotal + 1 \* Ptotal → False
(D) p(Zn) = 0.5 \* p(CO) + 2 \* p(CO2) → 1 \* Ptotal = 0.5 \* 1 \* Ptotal + 2 \* 1 \* Ptotal → False

The fracture stress (in MPa) is?;"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stress intensity factor (K) and the Griffith theory of brittle fracture.

The stress intensity factor (K) for an internal crack is given by:

K = Y \* σ \* sqrt(a)

where Y is a geometric factor, σ is the applied stress, and a is the crack length.

For the internal crack, Y = 1.12 and a = 5 μm = 5 x 10^-6 m.

K = 1.12 \* σ \* sqrt(5 x 10^-6) = 1.12 \* σ \* 7.07 x 10^-4 m^0.5

The stress intensity factor (K) for a surface crack is given by:

K = Y \* σ \* sqrt(a)

where Y is a geometric factor, σ is the applied stress, and a is the crack length.

For the surface crack, Y = 1.5 and a = 3 μm = 3 x 10^-6 m.

K = 1.5 \* σ \* sqrt(3 x 10^-6) = 1.5 \* σ \* 1.73 x 10^-3 m^0.5

The fracture stress (σ_f) is given by:

σ_f = K / sqrt(πa)

For the internal crack:

σ_f = (1.12 \* σ \* 7.07 x 10^-4 m^0.5) / sqrt(π \* 5 x 10^-6) = 1.12 \* σ \* 1.41

For the surface crack:

σ_f = (1.5 \* σ \* 1.73 x 10^-3 m^0.5) / sqrt(π \* 3 x 10^-6) = 1.5 \* σ \* 2.51

The fracture stress is the minimum of the two values:

σ_f = min(1.12 \* σ \* 1.41, 1.5 \* σ \* 2.51)

To find the fracture stress, we need to find the value of σ that satisfies the above equation.

The surface energy per unit area is given by:

γ = 1 J/m^2 = 1 x 10^6 Pa m

The Young's modulus is given by:

E = 70 GPa = 70 x 10^9 Pa

The fracture stress can be calculated using the Griffith theory:

σ_f = sqrt(2 \* E \* γ / πa)

For the internal crack:

σ_f = sqrt(2 \* 70 x 10^9 Pa \* 1 x 10^6 Pa m / π \* 5 x 10^-6 m) = 1.41 x 10^7 Pa = 14.1 MPa

The resolved shear stress can be calculated as:

τ = σ \* (1/√2)

where σ is the applied tensile stress.

For a critical resolved shear stress of 6 MPa, the required tensile stress is:

σ = 6 MPa

Since we want to find the tensile stress required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane, we can use the cosine of the angle between the slip direction and the applied stress:

cos(θ) = τ / σ

Substituting the values, we get:

cos(θ) = 6 MPa / (6 MPa \* (1/√2))

Simplifying, we get:

cos(θ) = √2 / 2

θ = 45°

This is the angle between the [100] direction and the [110] slip direction. Since the angle is 45°, the shear stress is fully mobilized, and the critical resolved shear stress is reached.

Therefore, the required tensile stress for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane is the same as the critical resolved shear stress:

An Ellingham diagram is a graphical representation of the Gibbs free energy of formation of various oxides as a function of temperature. The diagram is typically used to predict the stability of oxides and the conditions under which they can be formed.

The C + O2 = CO2 line in an Ellingham diagram represents the reaction between carbon and oxygen to form carbon dioxide. The slope of this line represents the change in Gibbs free energy of the reaction with temperature.

The correct answer is (A) The slope of the line is equal to the enthalpy change at standard state, which is approximately zero in this case.

The reason for this is that the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction C + O2 = CO2 is approximately zero at standard state. This is because the enthalpy of formation of CO2 is equal to the enthalpy of combustion of carbon, which is also approximately zero at standard state. As a result, the slope of the C + O2 = CO2 line in an Ellingham diagram is nearly horizontal, indicating that the Gibbs free energy of the reaction does not change significantly with temperature.

However, we can use the general properties of a bcc (body-centered cubic) metal to solve the problem.

In a bcc metal, the (100) plane has a higher surface energy than the (110) plane. This is because the (100) plane has a higher density of atoms at the surface, which leads to a higher energy due to the increased number of broken bonds.

The ratio of the surface energy per unit area of the (100) plane to that of the (110) plane can be calculated using the following formula:

Surface energy ratio = (γ100 / γ110)

where γ100 and γ110 are the surface energies per unit area of the (100) and (110) planes, respectively.

Since the (100) plane has a higher surface energy than the (110) plane, the surface energy ratio will be greater than 1. The exact value of the ratio will depend on the specific metal and its properties.

The rule of mixtures states that the elastic modulus of a composite material is given by:

E_composite = V_f * E_f + V_m * E_m

where E_composite is the elastic modulus of the composite material, V_f is the volume fraction of the fiber (glass fiber in this case), E_f is the elastic modulus of the fiber (70 GPa), V_m is the volume fraction of the matrix (polymer in this case), and E_m is the elastic modulus of the matrix (3.5 GPa).

In this case, the volume fraction of the fiber is 40%, so V_f = 0.4. The volume fraction of the matrix is therefore 1 - V_f = 0.6.

To prevent aspiration of molten metal, the maximum cross-section area (in $m^2$) at the base of the sprue is?;"Let's use the concept of continuity of flow rate to solve this problem.

The flow rate of melt (Q) is constant throughout the sprue. The flow rate is given by:

Q = A × v

where Q is the flow rate (m³/s), A is the cross-section area (m²), and v is the velocity of flow (m/s).

We know that the flow rate is constant (4 m³/s) and the top cross-section area is 2.2 m². We can write an equation using the given information:

4 = 2.2 × v

To find the velocity, we can solve for v:

v = 4 / 2.2
v = 1.82 m/s

The cross-section area is proportional to the square of the height (h) and inversely proportional to the velocity (v). We can write an equation using the concept of continuity of area:

A_base / h_base = A_top / h_top

where A_base is the cross-section area at the base, h_base is the height at the base, and so on.

We know that the height at the base (h_base) is the sum of the height (0.25 m) and the maximum area (A_base) divided by the average velocity (v). We can write an equation:

h_base = 0.25 + A_base / v

Substitute the given values:

h_base = 0.25 + A_base / 1.82

To find the maximum cross-section area (A_base), we can rearrange the equation:

A_base = (0.25 × 1.82) - 0.25
A_base ≈ 0.405 m²

So, the maximum cross-section area at the base of the sprue is approximately 0.405 m².

First, we need to calculate the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the aluminum bloom to the volume of the melt:

A/V = π × (750/2)^2 / (π × (750/2)^2 × 1000) = 1/5

The reference material is copper, for which the mould constant is typically 0.07-0.36 s/°mm². Since we're assuming a constant mould constant of 2 s/°mm², we'll use this value.

Using Chvorinov's rule, we can calculate the solidification time (t) for the aluminum bloom:

t = (A/V) x (m_value in s/°mm²)

t = (1/5) x 2 = 0.4 s/°mm²

Since we want the solidification time in minutes, we multiply this value by 60:

For a SiC grain size of 20 µm, the average interparticle (SiC-SiC) neck size (in µm) is:  (A) 3.03 (B) 4.28 (C) 9.16 (D) 18.32;"To solve this problem, we can use the following equation:

(1) τ = γ\*(ρ\*A)

where:
- τ is the neck diameter (in this case, the interparticle neck size)
- γ is the solid-solid grain boundary energy (0.80 J.m^(-2))
- ρ is the radius of the SiC grain (5 µm, since the diameter is given as 20 µm)
- A is the area of the grain boundary (π\*radius\*radius)

First, we need to find the area of the grain boundary:

A = π\*(5 µm)^2 = 78.5 µm^2

Now, we can use equation (1):

(2) τ = γ\*(ρ/A)

Substituting the values, we get:

τ = 0.80 J.m^(-2) \*(5 µm)^/78.5 µm^2 = 4.28 µm

1. Wire Drawing (P): This process involves reducing the cross-sectional area of a wire by pulling it through a die. The wire is subjected to tension, which is a type of direct compression. Therefore, the correct match is P-1.

The activation energy of a chemical reaction is a measure of the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. It's a fundamental concept in kinetics.

To estimate the activation energy, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a reaction to the temperature (T):

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

where A is the frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) k versus T: This is not a suitable plot to estimate activation energy. The Arrhenius equation shows that k increases with increasing T, but this plot doesn't provide a direct estimate of Ea.

(B) 1/k versus T: This plot is also not suitable. The Arrhenius equation shows that 1/k decreases with increasing T, but this plot doesn't provide a direct estimate of Ea.

(C) 1/k versus ln T: This plot is not suitable either. The Arrhenius equation shows that 1/k decreases with increasing T, but this plot doesn't provide a direct estimate of Ea.

(D) ln k versus 1/T: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! The Arrhenius equation can be rearranged to:

ln k = ln A - Ea/RT

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:

1/k = 1/Ae^(-Ea/RT)

Now, plot 1/k versus 1/T, and you'll get a straight line with a slope equal to -Ea/R. This is the Arrhenius plot, and it allows us to estimate the activation energy (Ea) directly from the slope.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Explanation:

The breakdown potential is the potential at which the passive film on the surface of stainless steel begins to break down, allowing corrosion to occur. The passive film is a thin layer of oxide that forms on the surface of stainless steel, protecting it from corrosion.

1. M: The metal itself
2. MS: The sulfide of the metal
3. MO: The oxide of the metal
4. $MSO_4$: The sulfate of the metal

We know that both $SO_2$ and $O_2$ are always present in the roaster. This means that the sulfide (MS) can react with $SO_2$ to form $MSO_4$, and the metal (M) can react with $O_2$ to form MO.

At thermodynamic equilibrium, the solid phases that can co-exist are those that are stable under the given conditions. Since $MSO_4$ can form from the reaction of MS and $SO_2$, it's likely that MS will react with $SO_2$ to form $MSO_4$ rather than existing as a separate phase.

Similarly, since MO can form from the reaction of M and $O_2$, it's likely that M will react with $O_2$ to form MO rather than existing as a separate phase.

Therefore, the solid phases that can co-exist at thermodynamic equilibrium are:

Mechanical;77;G-META-17-10;NUM;38;Tungsten powder is pressded at 150 MPa to a green density of 55%. After sintering, the compact attains 86.5% of its theoretical density. Assuming uniform shrinkage, the linear shrinkage (in %) is? (answer up to two decimal places);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The green density is 55%, which means the compact has a volume that is 55% of its theoretical volume.
2. After sintering, the compact attains 86.5% of its theoretical density. This means the compact has a volume that is 86.5% of its theoretical volume.
3. Since the compact has shrunk uniformly, the volume reduction is proportional to the initial volume. Let's call the initial volume ""V0"". Then, the final volume is 0.865V0.
4. We know that the initial volume is 55% of the theoretical volume, so the initial volume is 0.55Vt, where Vt is the theoretical volume.
5. We can set up an equation based on the fact that the final volume is 86.5% of the theoretical volume: 0.865Vt = V0.
6. Substitute the expression for V0 from step 4 into the equation: 0.865Vt = 0.55Vt.
7. Divide both sides by Vt: 0.865 = 0.55.
8. Subtract 0.55 from both sides: 0.315 = 0.

(answer up to three decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void of a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal.

The lattice parameter of an FCC metal is given by:

a = 2r√2

Given the lattice parameter a = 0.401 nm, we can find the radius of the metal atom:

r = a / (2√2)

= 0.285 nm

The radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void is given by:

r_void = (r / 3)√3

(answer up to two decimal places)";"Since we're dealing with an iron-carbon alloy, we can use the fact that pearlite is an interlamellar eutectoid compound, typically containing 0.8 wt.% C.

Let's break it down:

1. The eutectoid composition is 0.8 wt.% C.
2. The carbon content of ferrite is 0.025 wt.%. We can consider this as the residual carbon content, since we're dealing with a eutectoid composition.
3. The given alloy contains 0.35 wt.% C, which is greater than the eutectoid composition. This means that, initially, there's excess carbon present.
4. To find the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature (i.e., at the eutectoid point), we need to find the fraction of carbon that will form pearlite.

Let's assume x is the mass fraction of pearlite. Then, the remaining carbon content in the alloy can be found by subtracting the residual carbon content and the carbon content in the pearlite (0.8 wt.%) from the initial carbon content:

∴ (0.35 - 0.025 - 0.8x) = y

To find the mass fraction of pearlite, we want to set y equal to the mass fraction of pearlitalle:

x = 0.35 - 0.025 - (0.8)(0.02)

x = 0.09

Density = (Number of atoms per unit cell) x (Atomic mass) / (Lattice parameter)^3

We are given:

* Density = 19000 kg/m^3
* Lattice parameter = 0.4 nm = 0.4 x 10^-9 m
* Atomic weight = 183

We can rearrange the formula to solve for the number of atoms per unit cell:

Number of atoms per unit cell = (Density x Lattice parameter)^3 / Atomic weight

Plugging in the values, we get:

Number of atoms per unit cell = (19000 kg/m^3 x (0.4 x 10^-9 m)^3) / 183

Number of atoms per unit cell = (19000 x (0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4) x 10^-27) / 183

At low temperatures, crystalline metals exhibit limited ductility due to the reduced mobility of dislocations. The primary mechanisms of accommodating plastic strain in such metals are:

1. Twinning: This involves the formation of a new crystal structure by the duplication of a crystal plane, allowing for plastic deformation without significant dislocation movement.
2. Dislocation-slip: Although dislocation mobility is reduced at low temperatures, dislocations can still move by slipping along specific crystal planes, allowing for some plastic deformation.

The other options are not primary mechanisms for accommodating plastic strain at low temperatures in crystalline metals:

* Dislocation-climb (Option B) is a mechanism that occurs at higher temperatures, where dislocations can climb up or down the crystal lattice to relieve stress.
* Viscous-flow (Option D) is a mechanism that occurs at very high temperatures, where the metal exhibits a liquid-like behavior.
* Diffusion (Option C) is a mechanism that occurs at high temperatures, where atoms can diffuse through the crystal lattice to relieve stress.

The fracture strength (in MPa) of this material is?(answer up tp two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), which is a branch of solid mechanics that deals with the study of cracks and fracture in materials.

The stress intensity factor (K) for a brittle material can be evaluated using the following formula:

K = Y \* σ \* √(π \* a)

where K is the stress intensity factor, Y is the geometrical factor, σ is the fracture strength (in Pa), and a is the crack length (in meters).

Since the question asks for the fracture strength in MPa, we need to convert the unit of a from meter to meter.

First, we need to convert the crack length from micrometers (µm) to meters:

1 µm = 0.001 meters => 2 µm = 0.002 meters

Now, we can plug in the values given in the problem:

K = Y \* σ \* √(π \* 0.002)
K = Y \* σ \* √(0.00628)
K = Y \* σ \* 0.0792

The surface energy (0.5 J/m^2) is related to the stress intensity factor (K) through the following formula:

0.5 = (K^2) / (2 \* E \* π \* a)

where E is the Young's modulus (in Pa).

Rearranging the formula to solve for K^2, we get:

(K^2) = (2 \* E \* π \* a) \* 0.5
(K^2) = (2 \* 60,000,000,000 Pa \* 3.14 \* 0.002 meters) \* 0.5
(K^2) = 356,800,000 J/m^2

Now, we can plug in the value of K^2 into the formula:

K = Y \* σ \* √(0.00628)
K = σ \* √(356,800,000 J/m^2) / (2 \* 0.0792)
σ = 345.12 MPa
σ ≈ 345 MPa

* Decrease in grain size (B) generally increases the creep resistance and tensile strength due to grain boundary strengthening.
* Addition of dispersoids (C) may increase the creep resistance by increasing the grain boundary strengthening.

In FCC, this distance is given by:

where a is the lattice parameter. Given that a = 0.36 nm, we can calculate d:

d = 0.36 nm / √2 ≈ 0.255 nm

The second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern corresponds to the (220) reflection, which has a d-spacing of:

1. The material shows power law behavior, which means that the stress (σ) is proportional to the strain (ε) raised to a power (n). In this case, the power law behavior is given as σ = 50*ε^(0.3).
2. The material is being wire drawn, which means that it is being stretched or deformed in a specific way.
3. The maximum strain per pass in the annealed condition is the maximum amount of strain that the material can withstand before it becomes too stressed and deforms excessively.
4. Since the efficiency (η) is assumed to be 1, it means that all the work done on the material is converted into strain.

To find the maximum strain per pass, we can rearrange the power law equation to solve for ε:

ε = (σ / 50)^(1/0.3)

Since the maximum strain per pass is the maximum value of ε, we can set the derivative of ε with respect to σ equal to 0 and solve for σ:

dε/dσ = (1/0.3) * (σ / 50) ^ (-0.2) = 0

Solving for σ, we get:

σ = 50 * (0.3)^(3/2) = 50 * 0.35155 = 17.576

The initial rate of heat loss (in KW) from the top surface of slab by radiation and convection is?(answer up to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the heat loss from the top surface of the steel slab by radiation and convection.

Heat loss by radiation:

The radiation heat transfer rate (Q_rad) can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation:

Q_rad = εσAT^4

where ε is the emissivity of the steel (0.8), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.7 * 10^(-8) W/m^2.K^4), A is the area of the top surface of the slab (1m * 1m = 1m^2), and T is the temperature of the slab (1298 K).

Heat loss by convection:

The convective heat transfer rate (Q_conv) can be calculated using the convective heat transfer coefficient (h) and the temperature difference between the slab and the air:

Q_conv = hA(T_slab - T_air)

where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient (4.6 W/m^2.K), A is the area of the top surface of the slab (1m * 1m = 1m^2), T_slab is the temperature of the slab (1298 K), and T_air is the ambient temperature (298 K).

Here, c and c* are the instantaneous and equilibrium concentration of carbon in steel respectively, in units of wt.%. Given that c* = 0.04 wt.% and c( t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, the concentration of carbon in steel (in wt.%) at t= 1 min is? (answer up to three decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the given equation:

dC/dt = -(c-c*)

where dC/dt is the rate of change of carbon concentration with respect to time, c is the instantaneous concentration of carbon, and c* is the equilibrium concentration of carbon.

We are given that c* = 0.04 wt.% and c(t=0 min) = 0.4 wt.%. We want to find the concentration of carbon at t=1 min.

First, we can rewrite the equation as:

dc/dt = -k(c-c*)

where k is a constant.

Since c(t=0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, we can write:

dc/dt = -k(0.4 - 0.04)

Now, we can integrate both sides with respect to time:

∫dc = -k∫(0.4 - 0.04)dt

This gives:

c = -k(0.4 - 0.04)t + C

where C is the constant of integration.

We are given that c(t=0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, so we can substitute t=0 min and c=0.4 wt.% into the equation:

0.4 = -k(0.4 - 0.04)(0) + C

This gives:

C = 0.4

Now, we can substitute t=1 min and c=? into the equation:

c = -k(0.4 - 0.04)(1) + 0.4

Simplifying, we get:

c = 0.04 - 0.36k

We are given that c* = 0.04 wt.%, so we can set up the equation:

0.04 = 0.04 - 0.36k

Solving for k, we get:

k = 1

Now, we can substitute k=1 into the equation:

c = 0.04 - 0.36(1)

c = 0.04 - 0.36

c = 0.008

So, the concentration of carbon in steel at t=1 min is 0.008 wt.%.

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is: logK = (1160/T) + 2.003, where T is in Kelvin. Assuming Henrian activity coefficient of both O and C to be unity, the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of a plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600° C is?(answer up tp four decimal places);"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the value of T. Given that the temperature is 1600°C, we need to convert it to Kelvin:
T = 1600°C + 273.15°K = 1873 K

Next, we need to find the value of logK. Using the given equation, we get:
logK = (1160/T) + 2.003
Substitute T = 1873 K:
logK = (1160/1873) + 2.003
= -0.6145 + 2.003
= 1.3885

Now, we can find the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of the plain carbon steel melt at 1600°C using the equilibrium constant.

We need to find the value of [O] in Henry's law. We are given that the equilibrium constant is equal to the product of the activities of the equilibrium concentrations of O and C, divided by the activity of CO:
[O] × [C] / [CO] = K

Since the activity coefficient is unity, we can consider the activities equal to the concentrations:

[O] × 0.007 (wt% C) / [CO] = 1.3885

Simplify the equation:
[O] = (1.3885 × [CO]) / 0.007

Finally, we can solve for [O]:
[O] = (1.3885 × [CO]) / 0.007
= (1.3885 × 0.7608) / 0.007

A stoichiometric mixture of CO and pure oxygen at 1 atm and 25°C flows into a combustion reactor. The molar flow rate of CO entering the reactor is $1kg-mol.h^(-1)$. The adiabatic flame temperature(in K) for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is?(answer up to two decimal places);"To solve this question, we can use the first law of thermodynamics for an ideal gas process. The first law for an ideal gas process is as follows:

∆U = Q - W

where ∆U is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added, and W is the work done.

For an adiabatic process, Q = 0, and the heat is simply a function of the temperature change. The work done is also negligible since it's an ideal gas process. So we can rearrange the equation to give:

∆U = W

The work done (W) is given by:

W = ∫(pdA)

where p is the pressure and A is the area. Since the pressure is constant at 1 atm, the work done is just:

W = pA

Now we can use the ideal gas equation to relate the internal energy to the temperature. The ideal gas equation is as follows:

pV = nRT

where p is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature. Since the process is adiabatic, the temperature change can be expressed as:

T2 = T1(R²)

where T1 is the initial temperature and R is the compression ratio. Combining this with the work equation, we can relate the initial and final temperatures to the compression ratio:

pA = ∫(p(dV)) = ∫(pdV) = ∫(nRT(dV/V)) = ∫(nRdT)

Now we need to relate the initial and final temperatures to the compression ratio. Combining these equations, we get:

pA = ∫(nRdT) = nRT2 - nRT1

Solving for T2:

T2 = (pA + nRT1) / nR

For our problem, we know:

n = 1 kg-mol.
R = 8.314 J/mol.K
A = 1 atm * (kg-mol)^(-1)
∆H°_(298)(CO → $CO_2)$ = -282000 kJ

Combining these values:

T2 = (1 atm * (kg-mol)^(-1) + 1 kg-mol * 8.314 J/mol.K * (25°C)^(-1)) / (8.314 J/mol.K * 1 kg-mol * 8.314 J/mol.K)

Assuming activity equals concentration, the minimum pH at which $Fe^(+3)$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is?(answer up to two decimals places);"Let's start by writing the solubility product expression for $Fe(OH)_3$:

$K_{sp} = [Fe^{3+}][OH^-]^3$

We are given that the concentration of $Fe^{3+}$ is $10^{-3}$ M, and we want to find the minimum pH at which it will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$. This means that the concentration of $OH^-$ will be such that the product of the concentrations of $Fe^{3+}$ and $OH^-$ is equal to the solubility product.

We can start by writing an expression for the concentration of $OH^-$:

$[OH^-]^3 = \frac{K_{sp}}{[Fe^{3+}]} = \frac{10^{-39}}{10^{-3}} = 10^{-36}$

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

$[OH^-] = 10^{-12}$

Now, we can use the pH formula to find the pH:

$pH = -log[OH^-] = -log(10^{-12}) = 12$

So, the minimum pH at which $Fe^{3+}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is 12.00.

The specific energy consumption (in $kJ.kg^(-1) zinc) is? (answer up to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total energy consumption in kWh, and then convert it to kJ/kg-Zn.

The total energy consumption (in kWh) is given by:

Total Energy Consumption = Current (A) x Voltage (V) x Time (h)

Since the current and voltage are given, we need to calculate the time. The current efficiency is given as 90%, which means that 90% of the total current is used for zinc deposition. The remaining 10% is lost as heat, etc. Therefore, the actual current used for zinc deposition is:

Actual Current = 400 A x (90/100) = 360 A

The time required to deposit 1 kg of zinc can be calculated as:

Time = Total Charge / Actual Current
= (400 A x 3.5 V x 3600 s) / 360 A
= 432000 s

Now, we can calculate the total energy consumption:

Total Energy Consumption = 400 A x 3.5 V x 432000 s / 3600 s
= 432 kWh

The specific energy consumption is the total energy consumption per unit mass of zinc. Since the atomic weight of Zn is 65, the mass of 1 kg of Zn is:

Mass of Zn = 1000 g / 65 g/mol = 15.38 mol

The specific energy consumption is:

Specific Energy Consumption = Total Energy Consumption / Mass of Zn
= 432 kWh / 15.38 mol
= 28.03 kJ/mol

To convert this to kJ/kg-Zn, we multiply by the molar mass of Zn:

Specific Energy Consumption = 28.03 kJ/mol x (65 g/mol) / 1000 g/kg
= 18.23 kJ/kg-Zn

Applying Third law of thermodynamics, the value of entropy (in $J.K^(-1)$) of transformation of 368.5 K is ?(answer up to two decimal places);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The entropy change associated with heating orthorhombic sulfur from 0K to 368.5K is 36.86 J/K.
2. The entropy change associated with cooling monoclinic sulfur from 368.5K to 0K is -37.8 J/K.
3. Since the transformation from orthorhombic to monoclinic sulfur occurs above 368.5K, we can consider the entropy change associated with this transformation as the difference between the entropy change of heating orthorhombic sulfur and the entropy change of cooling monoclinic sulfur.

ΔS = ΔS_heat - ΔS_cool

μ_e + μ_h = 0.75 m^2 V^(-1) s^(-1) + 0.06 m^2 V^(-1) s^(-1) = 0.81 m^2 V^(-1) s^(-1)

Δσ = σ(maximum) - σ(minimum) = 200 MPa - 0 MPa = 200 MPa

a = 1 mm = 0.001 m

ΔK = 200 MPa \* √π \* 0.001 m = 3.5355 MPa.m^(1/2)

where α(t) is the fraction of recrystallized material at time t, k is a constant, and n is the Avrami exponent.

We are given that the recrystallization is 20% complete after 100s, so we can set up the equation:

0.20 = 1 - exp(-k(100)^2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

where σu is the fracture stress (or ultimate tensile stress) and e is the fracture strain. Since the material fractures at a strain of 0.45, we can use this value to calculate σu:

σu = σy \* e = 450,000,000 Pa \* 0.45 = 202,500,000 Pa

Now, we can calculate the ratio of resilience to toughness:

Ratio = U / K = 12,500 J/m^3 / (202,500,000 Pa \* 0.45) = 0.050

To three decimal places, the answer is:

Material manufacturing;77;G-META-17-53;NUM;65;Assume that exponent (n) is Chvorinov's equation is 2. Total time for solidication of a cubic casting of dimensions 5.0cm * 5.0cm * 5.0cm is 1.6 min. A cylindrical riser with diameter to height ratio 0.5 is required so that the time for solidification of riser is 3.2 min. Applying Chvorinov's rule, the height of rise (in cm) is? (answer up tp two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use Chvorinov's equation, which is:

t = K \* V^n

where t is the solidification time, K is a constant, V is the volume of the casting or riser, and n is the exponent.

We are given that the exponent (n) is 2, and the total time for solidification of the cubic casting is 1.6 minutes. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the volume of the casting:

V = (t / K)^(1/n)

Plugging in the values, we get:

V = (1.6 / K)^(1/2)

We are also given that the time for solidification of the cylindrical riser is 3.2 minutes. We can use the same equation to solve for the volume of the riser:

V = (3.2 / K)^(1/2)

Since the diameter to height ratio of the riser is 0.5, the volume of the riser is half the volume of the casting. We can set up an equation based on this:

(3.2 / K)^(1/2) = (1/2) \* (1.6 / K)^(1/2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(3.2 / 1.6)^(1/2) = 1

Solving for K, we get:

K = 2

Now that we have the value of K, we can find the volume of the casting:

V = (1.6 / 2)^(1/2) = 1.0 cm^3

Since the casting is a cube with dimensions 5.0cm * 5.0cm * 5.0cm, the height of the casting is:

Height = √(V / (5.0 * 5.0 * 5.0)) = √(1.0 / 125) = 0.16 cm

The height of the riser is twice the height of the casting, since the volume of the riser is half the volume of the casting. Therefore, the height of the riser is:

Height of riser = 2 \* 0.16 cm = 0.32 cm

However, the question asks for the height of the riser in cm, which is already given as 0.32 cm. Therefore, the correct answer is:

If the angle of bite during rolling is 10°, the maximum possible reduction (in mm) during rolling is?(answer up to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for maximum possible reduction in rolling:

Δh = (d \* tan(θ)) / (2 \* (R + h))

where:
Δh = maximum possible reduction
d = diameter of the roll
θ = angle of bite
R = radius of the roll
h = thickness of the slab

Given values:
d = 450 mm
θ = 10° = 0.1745 radians (converted to radians)
R = d/2 = 225 mm = 22.5 cm
h = 250 mm

First, convert the angle to radians:
θ = 0.1745 radians

Now, plug in the values:
Δh = (450 \* 0.1745) / (2 \* (22.5 + 25))
Δh = 39.375 / 47.5
Δh = 0.83 mm

To solve this, we need to apply the concept of sintering and the geometrical relations between grain size and neck size. Here's the thought process:

1. For liquid phase sintering at 1500°C, the tungsten grains are in a molten state.
2. The grains are bonded through a eutectic reaction, forming a wetting film between them.
3. The neck size is influenced by the grain size and the interfacial energies between the grains.
4. The Capillary Approximation formula can be used to determine the neck size:

 Neck size (N) = √(2\*grain size \* interfacial energy / surface tension)

5. Since the surface tension is not given, we can use a reasonable value for it (around 0.5 N/m for most metals). However, this is a rough estimate, and the actual value might be slightly different.

6. Plugging in the values, we get:

N = √(2 \* 40 µm \* 0.52 J/m² / 0.5 N/m)
N ≈ 14.4 µm

7. As we're asked to give the average neck size, we'll round the value to the nearest integer, which is:

At 300°C and $P_(H_2)$ = 0.09 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd in $mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd is? (answer up to one decimal place);"A classic problem of Henry's law!

Henry's law states: ""At a given temperature, the amount of a gas that dissolves in a solvent is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the solvent.""

Let's apply this law to our problem:

At 300°C and P(H2) = 1 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd is 1.64 * 10^4 mm^3 (STP) per kg of Pd.

We want to find the solubility at 300°C and P(H2) = 0.09 atm. According to Henry's law, the solubility should be proportional to the partial pressure of the gas.

So, we can write:

Solubility at 0.09 atm = Solubility at 1 atm × (0.09 atm / 1 atm)

= 1.64 * 10^4 mm^3 (STP) per kg Pd × (0.09 / 1)

The ageing of Al-4.5 wt.% Cu alloy involves the formation of various precipitates, including GP zones, θ`, θ`` and θ. The correct sequence of precipitation to reach stable equilibrium is:

(B) GP zone → θ`` → θ` → θ

Here's a brief explanation:

1. GP zones (Guinier-Preston zones) form first, which are small, spherical precipitates that are rich in Cu.
2. As the ageing process continues, the GP zones transform into θ`` (theta prime prime), which are larger and more stable precipitates.
3. Further ageing leads to the transformation of θ`` into θ` (theta prime), which is even larger and more stable.
4. Finally, the θ` precipitates transform into θ (theta), which is the most stable and largest precipitate.

(A) $𝛿_𝑣$ < $𝛿_𝑡$ (B) $𝛿_𝑣$ > $𝛿_𝑡$ (C) $𝛿_𝑣$ = $𝛿_𝑡$ (D) Information insufficient;"Based on the given context, we can analyze the situation:

* The flow is laminar, which means that the flow is smooth and continuous.
* The liquid metal has a significantly lower kinematic viscosity than its thermal diffusivity. This means that the liquid metal is more prone to heat transfer than momentum transfer.
* The temperature of the liquid metal is different from that of the plate.

Slip at room temperature occurs most easily on which of the following slip systems in Zn:Note: In hcp metals, the ideal c/a ratio is 1.633.   (A) {1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0> (B) {1 -1 0 0} <0 0 0 2> (C) {0 0 0 1} <1 1 -2 0> (D) {1 0 -1 -1} <1 1 -2 3>;"To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of slip systems in hcp metals and the importance of the c/a ratio.

In hcp metals, the c/a ratio is a measure of the relative lengths of the c-axis and the a-axis. A higher c/a ratio indicates that the c-axis is longer than the a-axis, which can affect the ease of slip.

Slip occurs when dislocations move through the crystal lattice, and the ease of slip is influenced by the orientation of the slip plane and the direction of the slip direction. In hcp metals, the most common slip systems are:

* {1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0> (prismatic slip)
* {1 -1 0 0} <0 0 0 2> (basal slip)
* {0 0 0 1} <1 1 -2 0> (pyramidal slip)
* {1 0 -1 -1} <1 1 -2 3> (pyramidal slip)

The c/a ratio of 1.856 for Zn indicates that the c-axis is longer than the a-axis, which suggests that the basal slip system ({1 -1 0 0} <0 0 0 2>) may be more difficult to activate due to the increased distance between the atoms on the basal plane.

On the other hand, the prismatic slip system ({1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0>) may be more easily activated due to the shorter distance between the atoms on the prismatic plane.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) {1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0>

At constant pressure, the number of phases is limited by the number of degrees of freedom in the system.

The electrical conductivity is proportional to the product of the charge carrier density and their mobility.

First, let's calculate the total charge carrier density:

Electron density = 1 * 10^16 m^-3
Hole density = 1 * 10^16 m^-3
Total charge carrier density = Electron density + Hole density = 2 * 10^16 m^-3

Now, let's calculate the total electrical conductivity:

Total electrical conductivity = σ = Charge carrier density * Carrier mobility

σ_electron = Electron density * Electron mobility
= (1 * 10^16 m^-3) * (0.1 m^2/Vs)
= 1 * 10^15 (Ω.m)^-1

σ_hole = Hole density * Hole mobility
= (1 * 10^16 m^-3) * (0.2 m^2/Vs)
= 2 * 10^15 (Ω.m)^-1

The total electrical conductivity is the sum of the electrical conductivity due to electrons and holes:

σ = σ_electron + σ_hole
= 1 * 10^15 (Ω.m)^-1 + 2 * 10^15 (Ω.m)^-1
= 3.2 * 10^15 (Ω.m)^-1

However, the correct answer is (C) 3.2 * 10^-4 (Ω.m)^-1, which is much smaller than our calculated value. This is because the given mobilities are expressed in m^2/Vs, not (Ω.m)^-1.

To convert the mobilities, we need to multiply by the electric constant (ε0) and the permittivity of Si (εr):

microscopic mobility (μ) = Mobility * ε0 * εr

μ_electron = (0.1 m^2/Vs) * (ε0) * (3.9 epsilon0)
= 0.1 * 8.854 * 10^-12 F/m * 3.9
= 3.54 * 10^-2 m^2/Vs

μ_hole = (0.2 m^2/Vs) * (ε0) * (3.9)
= 0.78 * 10^-2 m^2/Vs

Now, we can calculate the total electrical conductivity:

σ = σ_electron + σ_hole
= (1 * 10^16 m^-3) * (3.54 * 10^-2 m^2/Vs) + (1 * 10^16 m^-3) * (0.78 * 10^-2 m^2/Vs)

The most abundant anion in the melt is the silicate anion, which is (SiO4)^2-. However, the question asks for the most abundant anion, not the silicate anion. Since the silicate anion is already present in the compound, we need to consider the other anions that might be present in the melt.

The molar free energy (J $mol^(-1)$) of a liquid solution of a binary A-B alloy as a function of temperature ( T ) and composition (x, the mole fraction of B) is given by: $G^(L)(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x) where $(G_(A))^(0,L)$ and $(G_(B))^(0,L)$ are the molar free energies of pure liquid A and pure liquid B. What is the excess molar free energy, $𝐺^(XS,L)$, for an alloy with 𝑥 = 0.5 at 𝑇 = 1000 K?  (A) 1000 J $mol^(-1)$ (B) - 2000 J $mol^(-1)$ (C) 4763 J $mol^(-1)$ (D) - 5763 J $mol^(-1)$;"To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the expression for the molar free energy of the liquid solution at the given temperature and composition.

Given: x = 0.5, T = 1000 K

We are given the expression for the molar free energy:

G^(L)(T,x) = (1-x)*[G_(A)]^(0,L) + x*[G_(B)]^(0,L) + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x)

We are asked to find the excess molar free energy, G^(XS,L), which is the difference between the molar free energy of the solution and the molar free energy of the pure components.

G^(XS,L) = G^(L)(T,x) - [G_(A)]^(0,L) - [G_(B)]^(0,L)

Substituting x = 0.5, we get:

G^(L)(T,0.5) = (1-0.5)*[G_(A)]^(0,L) + 0.5*[G_(B)]^(0,L) + RT[0.5ln0.5 + 0.5ln0.5] + 4000*0.5*0.5
= [G_(B)]^(0,L) - [G_(A)]^(0,L) + RT*ln(0.5) + 2000

Now, we need to evaluate the expression at T = 1000 K:

G^(L)(1000 K, 0.5) = [G_(B)]^(0,L) - [G_(A)]^(0,L) + 8.314*1000*ln(0.5) + 2000
= [G_(B)]^(0,L) - [G_(A)]^(0,L) + 4132 + 2000
= [G_(B)]^(0,L) - [G_(A)]^(0,L) + 6132

The excess molar free energy is:

G^(XS,L) = G^(L)(1000 K, 0.5) - [G_(A)]^(0,L) - [G_(B)]^(0,L)
= 6132 - [G_(A)]^(0,L) - [G_(B)]^(0,L)

Since the values of [G_(A)]^(0,L) and [G_(B)]^(0,L) are not given, we cannot determine the exact value of G^(XS,L). However, we can eliminate some of the answer choices based on the sign of the expression.

Since the expression is positive, we can eliminate choices (B) and (D), which have negative values.

The correct answer is:

(C) 4763 J $mol^(-1)$

Note that this is an approximate answer, as the exact value of G^(XS,L) depends on the values of [G_(A)]^(0,L) and [G_(B)]^(0,L).";;A;0;

Assertion [A]: For a material exhibiting Coble creep, a reduction in grain size results in a significant increase in creep rate.

Reason [R]: Grain boundaries act as a barrier to motion of dislocations

Coble creep is a type of creep that occurs in materials with a high grain boundary diffusion coefficient and a low lattice diffusion coefficient. In Coble creep, the grain boundaries act as a pathway for the diffusion of atoms, allowing the material to deform plastically.

Grain boundaries do act as a barrier to the motion of dislocations, which are defects in the crystal lattice that can move and cause plastic deformation. However, in Coble creep, the grain boundaries are not a barrier to the motion of dislocations, but rather a pathway for the diffusion of atoms.

A reduction in grain size would actually decrease the creep rate in Coble creep, not increase it. This is because a smaller grain size means that the grain boundaries are shorter and more numerous, making it easier for atoms to diffuse along the grain boundaries and reducing the creep rate.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Refractory BCC metals like W and Mo are less ductile than FCC metals like Ni and Pt at room temperature.

This statement suggests that BCC metals are less capable of undergoing plastic deformation, i.e., they are less ductile.

Reason: BCC metals have fewer independent slip systems than FCC metals.

This reason implies that BCC metals exhibit fewer operating systems for slip, which is a factor that can affect ductility.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A]

Since BCC metals do have fewer independent slip systems than FCC metals, and this does affect ductility, this option is correct.

(B) Both [A] and [R] are true, but [R] is not the correct reason for [A]

This option is incorrect because we've established that the reason is indeed correct.

(C) Both [A] and [R] are false

This option is incorrect because the statement is correct, and the reason is also correct.

(D) [A] is true but [R] is false

This option is incorrect because both the statement and the reason are correct.

Pick the correct answer based on the information provided above: Note: The glass fibre contains a population of flaws of different lengths.  (A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture (B) The fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture (C) The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture (D) The fibre will undergo buckling;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the critical stress intensity factor (KIC) of the glass fiber. The KIC is a measure of the material's resistance to crack propagation.

The surface energy (γ) and elastic modulus (E) of the material are given as:

γ = 0.3 J/m²
E = 70 GPa = 70,000 MPa

The diameter of the glass fiber is 5 microns, which is equivalent to:

d = 5 microns = 5 x 10^-6 meters

The critical stress intensity factor (KIC) can be calculated using the following formula:

KIC = γ \* π \* d

Substituting the values, we get:

KIC = 0.3 J/m² \* π \* (5 x 10^-6 meters) = 0.0475 MPa√m

The tensile stress applied to the fiber is 20 MPa. To determine the fracture behavior of the fiber, we need to compare the applied stress with the critical stress intensity factor.

Since the applied stress (20 MPa) is less than the critical stress intensity factor (0.0475 MPa√m), the fiber will not undergo brittle fracture.

What is the voltage required to electrolytically refine impure copper of activity $𝑎_(𝐶𝑢)$ = 0.9 (Raoultian standard state) to pure copper at 300 K  (A) 1.36 mV (B) 2.72 mV (C) 0 mV (D) 5.44 mV;"A chemistry question!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. We're given the activity of the impure copper, `a_Cu` = 0.9, which is the fraction of the pure copper's concentration in the impure solution.
2. We're asked to electrolytically refine this impure copper to pure copper at 300 K. This means we need to remove the impurities (e.g., other ions, defects) from the copper by applying an electric potential (voltage) to electrolyze the impurities.
3. The Faraday's constant, `F` = 96500 C mol⁻¹, relates the charge of one equivalent of ions to the electronic charge (1 F = 1 C/mol).
4. The gas constant, `R` = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹, relates the energy of the system to the temperature (Kelvin).

Now, let's use these constants to solve the question:

To electrolytically refine the impure copper, we need to apply a voltage that's sufficient to force the removal of the impurities. We can relate the voltage (potential difference) to the thermodynamic properties of the system.

Since we're dealing with an electrochemical reaction, we can use Gibbs free energy (ΔG) to relate the voltage to the concentration difference between pure and impure copper:

ΔG = -nF × ΔE

where:

* ΔG is the change in Gibbs free energy (in J/mol)
* n is the number of electrons transferred per ion (n = 1 for copper's single electron)
* F is Faraday's constant (in C/mol)
* ΔE is the potential difference (voltage) between the pure and impure copper (in Volts)

Now, we need to make a few assumptions and simplifications:

* Assume ideal behavior for the copper ions in solution.
* Ignore any effects from the electrolysis process itself (e.g., side reactions, resistance).
* Use the Raoultian standard state (RTs) as a reference state for the pure copper.

We can rewrite the equation for ΔG as:

ΔG = -nF × RTs × ln(a_Cu) / a_RTS

where:

* `a_RTS` is the activity of pure copper (Raoultian standard state) = 1 (by definition)
* `a_Cu` is the activity of the impure copper (0.9, given)

Now, we need to find the voltage (ΔE) that corresponds to this ΔG. Since ΔG is a measure of the energy changed during the process, we can set it equal to zero, assuming the process is electrochemically reversible:

0 = ΔG = -nF × RTs × ln(a_Cu)

Simplify the equation:

0 = -F × RTs × ln(0.9)

Now, solve for ΔE (voltage):

ΔE = ΔG / nF

Substitute the given values and calculate:

ΔE ≈ 0.00544 V or 5.44 mV

**Make the surface of the mineral hydrophobic**

In other words, collectors are used to add a non-polar (hydrophobic) coating to the mineral particles, making them repel water and attach to air bubbles, which are then lifted to the surface and removed from the process stream. This allows the separation of particles with different surface properties.

The Young’s modulus of fiber and matrix, respectively are $𝐸_𝑓$ = 250 GPa and $𝐸_𝑚$ = 2.5 GPa. If the composite is subjected to longitudinal loading (iso-strain condition and assuming elastic response), what is the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement rounded off to two decimal places?;"To solve this problem, we can use the rule of mixtures, which states that the Young's modulus of a composite material is given by:

E_c = V_f * E_f + V_m * E_m

where E_c is the Young's modulus of the composite, V_f is the volume fraction of the fibers, E_f is the Young's modulus of the fibers, V_m is the volume fraction of the matrix, and E_m is the Young's modulus of the matrix.

Given that the volume fraction of the fibers is 25%, we can write:

V_f = 0.25

We are also given the values of the Young's moduli:

E_f = 250 GPa
E_m = 2.5 GPa

Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

E_c = 0.25 * 250 GPa + 0.75 * 2.5 GPa
= 62.5 GPa + 1.875 GPa
= 64.375 GPa

Now, we need to find the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement. Since the composite is subjected to longitudinal loading, the strain in the composite is the same as the strain in the fibers. Therefore, the load borne by the fibers is proportional to the Young's modulus of the fibers.

Let's define the fraction of load borne by the fibers as x. Then, the fraction of load borne by the matrix is 1 - x.

The total load borne by the composite is given by:

P = E_c * A * ε

where P is the total load, A is the cross-sectional area of the composite, and ε is the strain.

The load borne by the fibers is given by:

P_f = E_f * A * x * ε

The load borne by the matrix is given by:

P_m = E_m * A * (1 - x) * ε

Since the composite is subjected to longitudinal loading, the total load borne by the composite is equal to the sum of the loads borne by the fibers and the matrix:

P = P_f + P_m

Substituting the expressions for P_f and P_m, we get:

P = E_f * A * x * ε + E_m * A * (1 - x) * ε

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P = A * ε * (E_f * x + E_m * (1 - x))

Since the strain is the same for both the fibers and the matrix, we can cancel out the strain term:

P = A * (E_f * x + E_m * (1 - x))

Now, we can solve for x:

x = (P / A) * (E_f / (E_f + E_m))

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

x = (P / A) * (250 GPa / (250 GPa + 2.5 GPa))
= (P / A) * (250 GPa / 252.5 GPa)
= (P / A) * 0.991

Rounding off to two decimal places, we get:

The volume of a unit cell can be calculated using the formula:

For the BCC phase:

Volume = (0.293 nm)^3 = 0.0213 nm^3

The percentage change in volume can be calculated as:

Percentage change = ((V2 - V1) / V1) * 100

The melting point of the base material is 1500 K. The width(in mm to two decimal places) of the fusion zone is?;"To solve this problem, we need to find the value of x at which T(x) = 1500.

We can start by recalling that exp(-0.3*x^2) can be rewritten as (0.5)^(-0.6*x) (based on the exponent rules).

Now, we can use the formula:

T(x) = 2000 * (0.5)^(-0.6*x) = 1500

To find x:

(2000 / 1500) = (0.5)^(-0.6*x)

Now, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

log2((2000 / 1500)) = -0.6*x * log2(0.5)

Simplifying this expression:

log2(4/3) = -0.6*x * (-1)

Since log2(4/3) ≈ 0.373, we can solve for x:

0.373 ≈ -0.6*x

The terminal velocity(in mm$s^(-1)$ to two decimal places) (𝑣) of a spherical inclusion of diameter D = 50 micrometers rising in liquid steel is?";"To solve this problem, we can use Stokes' law, which states that the drag force (Fd) on a spherical object is proportional to the viscosity of the fluid (μ), the diameter of the object (D), and the velocity of the object (v), and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid (ρ).

The drag force can be written as:

Fd = 3πμDv

We are given the following values:

* Density of liquid steel (ρ) = 7900 kg/m³
* Viscosity of liquid steel (μ) = 0.0079 Pa·s
* Density of the inclusion (ρi) = 2500 kg/m³
* Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s²
* Diameter of the inclusion (D) = 50 micrometers = 0.05 mm

We want to find the terminal velocity (v) of the inclusion, which is the velocity at which the upward force (buoyancy force) equals the downward force (drag force).

The buoyancy force (Fb) is given by:

Fb = ρiVg

where V is the volume of the inclusion. Since the inclusion is spherical, its volume is given by:

V = (4/3)π(D/2)³

Substituting the values, we get:

V = (4/3)π(0.025 mm)³ = 1.047 × 10^-8 m³

Fb = 2500 kg/m³ × 1.047 × 10^-8 m³ × 9.8 m/s² = 0.0245 N

The drag force (Fd) is given by Stokes' law:

Fd = 3πμDv

We can rearrange this equation to solve for v:

What is the value of the resolved shear stress on the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system in MPa rounded off to two decimal places?;"To solve this problem, we need to find the resolved shear stress (τ) on the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system. We can do this by using the following formula:

τ = σ \* (b \* n)

where σ is the applied tensile stress (10 MPa), b is the Schmid factor, and n is the normal to the slip plane.

First, we need to find the Schmid factor (b). The Schmid factor is a measure of the component of the applied stress that is parallel to the slip direction. For the (1 1 -1) [101] slip system, the slip direction is [101] and the normal to the slip plane is [1 1 -1].

The Schmid factor can be calculated using the following formula:

b = |(1 1 -1) \* [101]| / |(1 1 -1)|

where | | denotes the magnitude of the vector.

Plugging in the values, we get:

b = |(1 1 -1) \* [101]| / |(1 1 -1)| = |(1 \* 1 + 1 \* 1 - 1 \* 1)| / √3 = 1 / √3

Next, we need to find the normal to the slip plane (n). The normal to the slip plane is perpendicular to the slip direction, so we can find it by taking the cross product of the slip direction with the unit vector in the [321] direction.

The unit vector in the [321] direction is:

[321] / √(3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = [0.5774 0.5774 0.5774]

The cross product of the slip direction [101] with this unit vector is:

n = [101] × [0.5774 0.5774 0.5774] = [0.5774 0.5774 0.5774] × [1 0 1] = [0.5774 0.5774 0.5774]

Given: 𝜇𝐵 = 9.273 × $10^(-24)$ A $m^2$, Lattice parameter of BCC iron is 0.287 nm Note: kA is kiloAmperes;"Let's solve the question.

The net magnetic moment of an Fe atom in BCC structure is given by:

m = 2 𝜇𝐵

The saturation magnetization (Ms) is the maximum possible magnetic moment per atom. Since each Fe atom in the BCC structure has a magnetic moment of 2 𝜇𝐵, the saturation magnetization is:

Ms = m / Volume of 1 iron atom

The volume of 1 iron atom in the BCC structure can be calculated using the lattice parameter:

Volume of 1 iron atom = (4/3) \* π \* (0.287 nm)^3 = 7.24 × 10^-29 m^3

Now, we can calculate the saturation magnetization:

Ms = m / Volume of 1 iron atom
= 2 𝜇𝐵 / (7.24 × 10^-29 m^3)

Given: Gas constant R = 8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$;"Since it's an ideal solid solution, the entropy of mixing can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS = -R[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)]

where x is the mole fraction of Au.

We are given 2 moles of Au and 3 moles of Ag, so the total number of moles is 2 + 3 = 5. The mole fraction of Au is:

x = 2/5

Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

ΔS = -R[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)]
= -8.314 [ (2/5)ln(2/5) + (3/5)ln(3/5) ]
= -8.314 [ (0.4)ln(0.4) + (0.6)ln(0.6) ]

A spherical liquid metal droplet of diameter 1 mm is solidified in a stream of gas at 300 K. Assuming that the metal droplet remains at its melting point of 900 K and neglecting radiative losses, the time(in seconds to one decimal place) to complete the solidification is?";"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the surface area of the metal droplet:

Surface area = 4 \* π \* (0.001 m)^2 = 0.01256 m^2

2. Calculate the heat transfer rate:

Heat transfer rate = convective heat transfer coefficient \* surface area \* temperature difference
= 200 W/m^2K \* 0.01256 m^2 \* (900 K - 300 K)

The Raoultian activity coefficient ($𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)$) of Zn in Zn-Cd alloy liquid at 710 K is approximated by: ln($𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)$) = 0.875 * $(1 − $𝑋_(𝑍𝑛)$)^2$. The ratio [$𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=0.7)/𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=1.0)$] for a liquid alloy with $𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)$ = 0.7 is?(upto two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the given equation for the Raoultian activity coefficient of Zn in Zn-Cd alloy liquid:

ln(γZn) = 0.875(1 - XZn)^2

We are given that pZn(XZn=1.0) = 3.6 * 10^(-4) atm, which means that the vapour pressure of pure liquid Zn at XZn = 1.0 is 3.6 * 10^(-4) atm.

We are asked to find the ratio of the vapour pressure of the alloy at XZn = 0.7 to the vapour pressure of pure liquid Zn at XZn = 1.0. This ratio can be written as:

[pZn(XZn=0.7)/pZn(XZn=1.0)] = [pZn(XZn=0.7)/3.6 * 10^(-4)]

To find pZn(XZn=0.7), we can use the given equation for the Raoultian activity coefficient:

ln(γZn) = 0.875(1 - XZn)^2

Substituting XZn = 0.7, we get:

ln(γZn) = 0.875(1 - 0.7)^2
= 0.875(0.09)
= 0.07925

Now, we can use the definition of the Raoultian activity coefficient to find pZn(XZn=0.7):

pZn(XZn=0.7) = pZn(XZn=1.0) * γZn
= 3.6 * 10^(-4) * exp(0.07925)
= 3.6 * 10^(-4) * 1.082

The temperature(in K to one decimal place). above which $Ag_(2)O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm is?;"To solve this problem, we can use the following equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

where ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS° is the standard entropy change.

We are given the values of ΔH° and ΔS°, and we need to find the temperature above which Ag2O decomposes. We can rearrange the equation to solve for T:

T = ΔH° / ΔS° + ΔG° / ΔS°

First, we need to find ΔG°. We can use the following equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

Rearranging this equation to solve for ΔG°, we get:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔG° = -61080 J - T(-132.22 J/K)

ΔG° = -61080 J + 132.22 TJ

Now, we can use the following equation to find the temperature above which Ag2O decomposes:

T = ΔH° / ΔS° + ΔG° / ΔS°

Substituting the given values, we get:

T = -61080 J / (-132.22 J/K) + (-61080 J + 132.22 TJ) / (-132.22 J/K)

T = 461.5 K + (-461.5 K)

T = 0 K

This is not a valid temperature, so we need to find the temperature above which Ag2O decomposes. We can do this by setting ΔG° = 0 and solving for T:

0 = -61080 J + T(-132.22 J/K)

T = 61080 J / 132.22 J/K

T = 461.5 K

Therefore, the temperature above which Ag2O decomposes is 461.5 K.

What is the wavelength of X-rays in nm rounded off to three decimal places? Given: The lattice parameter of iron = 0.287 nm;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation, which relates the wavelength of X-rays to the lattice parameter and the angle of diffraction:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of X-rays, d is the lattice parameter, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

Given that the first peak occurs at 2θ = 68.7°, we can use the Bragg equation to find the wavelength of X-rays. Since the lattice parameter of iron is 0.287 nm, we can plug in the values to get:

nλ = 2(0.287)sin(34.35°)

where 34.35° is half of the angle of diffraction (68.7°).

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Assume that the system containing the two pieces of copper remains isolated during this process. A 1 mol piece of copper at 400 K is brought in contact with another 1 mol piece of copper at 300 K, and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. The entropy(in J $K^(-1)$ to three decimal places) change for this process is?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The system is isolated, so the total energy of the system remains constant.
2. The specific heat capacity of copper is given as 22.6 J K^-1 mol^-1. This means that the heat energy required to change the temperature of 1 mol of copper by 1 K is 22.6 J.
3. The initial temperature of one piece of copper is 400 K, and the final temperature is the same as the initial temperature of the other piece of copper, which is 300 K. This means that the temperature change of one piece of copper is ΔT1 = 400 K - 300 K = 100 K.
4. The temperature change of the other piece of copper is ΔT2 = 300 K - 400 K = -100 K. Since the system is isolated, the total energy change is zero, so the heat energy gained by one piece of copper is equal to the heat energy lost by the other piece of copper.
5. The heat energy gained by one piece of copper is Q1 = mcΔT1, where m is the mass of copper (1 mol) and c is the specific heat capacity (22.6 J K^-1 mol^-1). Plugging in the values, we get Q1 = (1 mol)(22.6 J K^-1 mol^-1)(100 K) = 2260 J.
6. The heat energy lost by the other piece of copper is Q2 = -Q1 = -2260 J.
7. The entropy change for one piece of copper is ΔS1 = Q1 / T1, where T1 is the initial temperature (400 K). Plugging in the values, we get ΔS1 = 2260 J / 400 K = 5.65 J K^-1.
8. The entropy change for the other piece of copper is ΔS2 = -Q2 / T2, where T2 is the initial temperature (300 K). Plugging in the values, we get ΔS2 = -2260 J / 300 K = -7.53 J K^-1.
9. The total entropy change for the system is the sum of the entropy changes for the two pieces of copper: ΔS = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = 5.65 J K^-1 - 7.53 J K^-1 = -1.88 J K^-1.

The flow stress in compression is 40 MPa, and remains constant throughout the process.;"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for ideal plastic work (W) involved in extruding a cylindrical billet:

W = π \* (r1^2 - r2^2) \* σ \* L

where:
W = ideal plastic work (in J)
π = pi (approximately 3.14)
r1 = initial radius of the billet (mm)
r2 = final radius of the billet (mm)
σ = flow stress in compression (MPa)
L = length of the billet (mm)

r1 = 10 mm (since the initial diameter is 20 mm)
r2 = 8 mm (since the final diameter is 16 mm)
σ = 40 MPa
L = 100 mm

When the partial pressure of CO ($𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$) is 1 atm, K = 0.002. If $𝑝_(𝐶𝑂)$ = 0.1 atm, what is the value of K, at the same temperature? Note: Assume Henry’s law is applicable.  (A) 0.06 (B) 0.002 (C) 0.02 (D) 0.0002;"Based on the given context and the relation provided, we can assume that Henry's law is applicable. Henry's law states that the partial pressure of a gas in equilibrium with a solid and its solution is proportional to the concentration of the gas in the solution.

The relation given is (wt.%C)(wt.%O) = K, which suggests that the product of the weight percentages of C and O is constant. This is consistent with Henry's law, as the product of the concentrations of C and O in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of CO.

When the partial pressure of CO is 1 atm, the concentration of C and O in the solution is such that (wt.%C)(wt.%O) = K = 0.002. If the partial pressure of CO is now 0.1 atm, the concentration of C and O in the solution will also change.

Using Henry's law, we can write:

$𝑝_(𝐶𝑂) ∝ (wt.%C) (wt.%O)$

Since the partial pressure of CO is proportional to the product of the concentrations of C and O, and the partial pressure is decreased by a factor of 10, the product of the concentrations of C and O must also be decreased by a factor of 10.

Thus, the new value of K can be found by multiplying the original value by the ratio of the new partial pressure to the original partial pressure:

K = (1 atm) × (0.002) = (0.1 atm) × (K)

K = (0.1 atm) × (0.002) = 0.0002

Beach marks are a phenomenon observed on the fractured surfaces of metals after a specific type of testing. They are typically seen on the fractured surfaces of metals that have undergone cyclic loading, such as fatigue testing.

From the options, option B, Fatigue test, is the most likely correct answer. Fatigue testing involves applying repeated cycles of loading and unloading to a material, which can cause the material to fail due to the accumulation of micro-cracks. The beach marks are a result of the material's attempt to relieve the stress concentrations that develop during these cycles.

The other options are not directly related to beach marks:

* Creep test (A) involves testing a material's ability to deform under constant stress over time, which is not typically associated with beach marks.
* Impact test (C) involves testing a material's ability to absorb energy during a sudden impact, which may not produce beach marks.
* Compression test (D) involves testing a material's ability to withstand compressive forces, which is not typically associated with beach marks.

Alligatoring is a defect that occurs when a material, usually a metal, is processed or formed in a way that causes it to develop a series of cracks or creases that resemble the scales on an alligator's back. This defect is often associated with improper or excessive drying, chemical reactions, or processing procedures.

Considering the context, the correct answer is:

(C) Sheet metal forming

Sheet metal forming is a process that involves shaping and molding metal sheets into various forms and shapes. Alligatoring can occur when the metal is not properly dried or processed, resulting in cracks and creases on the surface.";;D;0;

The Bragg angle (θ) for the reflection from (111) planes is 21.68°. The wavelength of X-rays (in nm, rounded off to three decimal places) is;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg equation:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the distance between the (111) planes, and θ is the Bragg angle.

First, we need to find the distance between the (111) planes. The lattice parameter of the FCC crystal is 0.3615 nm, and the distance between the (111) planes is given by:

d = a/√3

where a is the lattice parameter. Plugging in the value of a, we get:

d = 0.3615 nm / √3 ≈ 0.2045 nm

Now we can use the Bragg equation to find the wavelength of the X-rays:

nλ = 2dsinθ

Rearranging the equation to solve for λ, we get:

λ = n(2dsinθ) / 2

Plugging in the values, we get:

λ = n(2 × 0.2045 nm × sin(21.68°)) / 2

λ ≈ 0.071 nm

Rounded off to three decimal places, the answer is:

[0.071]

Note: The value of n is not specified in the problem, but it is typically an integer. In this case, we can assume n = 1, since the Bragg equation is typically used to find the wavelength of X-rays.";;0.153 TO 0.155;0;
Mechanical;84;G-META-19-25;NUM;51;A plate of width 100 𝑐𝑚 and thickness 5 𝑐𝑚 is rolled to a thickness of 3 𝑐𝑚. If the entry velocity is 10 $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$ , the exit velocity of the plate (in $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^(−1)$ , rounded off to one decimal place) is? Assume no change in the width of the plate;"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The plate is rolled to a thickness of 3 cm, which means the thickness is reduced by 2 cm (5 cm - 3 cm = 2 cm). The width of the plate remains the same, which is 100 cm.

The entry velocity is 10 cm/s. We need to find the exit velocity.

The mass of the plate remains the same, but its thickness is reduced. This means the plate will have a higher density after rolling.

The conservation of mass equation is:

m1 = m2

where m1 is the initial mass of the plate and m2 is the final mass of the plate.

The mass of the plate can be calculated as:

m = width × thickness × density

Since the width remains the same, we can write:

m = 100 cm × 5 cm × ρ

where ρ is the density of the plate.

After rolling, the thickness is reduced to 3 cm, so the new mass can be calculated as:

m2 = 100 cm × 3 cm × ρ

Since the mass remains the same, we can set up the equation:

100 cm × 5 cm × ρ = 100 cm × 3 cm × ρ

Simplifying the equation, we get:

ρ = ρ

This means the density of the plate remains the same.

Now, we can use the conservation of momentum equation to find the exit velocity:

m1 × v1 = m2 × v2

where v1 is the entry velocity and v2 is the exit velocity.

Substituting the values, we get:

100 cm × 5 cm × ρ × 10 cm/s = 100 cm × 3 cm × ρ × v2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

v2 = 15.38 cm/s

Rounded off to one decimal place, the exit velocity is:

15.4 cm/s

Mechanical;85;G-META-19-32;MCQS;46;An aluminium single crystal is loaded in tension along [1 -1 0] axis. Among the following slip systems, the one that will be activated first is?  (A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1] (B) (-1 -1 1)[011] (C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0] (D) (-1 -1 1)[101];"To solve this problem, we need to identify the slip system that will be activated first in an aluminum single crystal loaded in tension along the [1 -1 0] axis.

In aluminum, the slip systems are of the form (hkl)[uvw], where h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the slip plane and u, v, and w are the Miller indices of the slip direction.

The slip systems that are listed in the options are:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]
(B) (-1 -1 1)[011]
(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]
(D) (-1 -1 1)[101]

To determine which slip system will be activated first, we need to calculate the Schmid factor for each slip system. The Schmid factor is a measure of the ease of slip on a particular slip system, and it is given by:

Schmid factor = |b·n|

where b is the slip direction and n is the normal to the slip plane.

For the slip system (hkl)[uvw], the slip direction is [uvw] and the normal to the slip plane is [hkl].

Using the given context, we can calculate the Schmid factor for each slip system:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]
Schmid factor = |(0 -1 1)·(1 -1 -1)| = |0 -1 -1| = 1

(B) (-1 -1 1)[011]
Schmid factor = |(0 1 1)·(-1 -1 1)| = |-1 -1 1| = 1

(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]
Schmid factor = |(1 -1 0)·(-1 -1 1)| = |-1 -1 1| = 1

(D) (-1 -1 1)[101]
Schmid factor = |(1 0 1)·(-1 -1 1)| = |-1 -1 1| = 1

All the Schmid factors are equal to 1, which means that all the slip systems have the same ease of slip. However, the slip system that will be activated first is the one that has the highest resolved shear stress (RSS) on the slip system.

The RSS is given by:

RSS = τ·cos(φ)

where τ is the applied stress and φ is the angle between the applied stress and the slip direction.

Using the given context, we can calculate the RSS for each slip system:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]
RSS = τ·cos(π/4) = τ/√2

(B) (-1 -1 1)[011]
RSS = τ·cos(π/4) = τ/√2

(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]
RSS = τ·cos(π/4) = τ/√2

(D) (-1 -1 1)[101]
RSS = τ·cos(π/4) = τ/√2

All the RSS values are equal, which means that all the slip systems have the same resolved shear stress. However, the slip system that will be activated first is the one that has the highest resolved shear stress on the slip system.

Since all the RSS values are equal, we need to consider other factors such as the crystal structure and the orientation of the slip system. In aluminum, the slip systems are of the form (hkl)[uvw], where h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the slip plane and u, v, and w are the Miller indices of the slip direction.

The slip system that will be activated first is the one that has the highest density of dislocations on the slip plane. This is because the dislocations provide the necessary nucleation sites for the slip process.

Using the given context, we can calculate the density of dislocations on each slip plane:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]
Density of dislocations = 1/√2

(B) (-1 -1 1)[011]
Density of dislocations = 1/√2

(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]
Density of dislocations = 1/√2

(D) (-1 -1 1)[101]
Density of dislocations = 1/√2

All the density of dislocations values are equal, which means that all the slip systems have the same density of dislocations. However, the slip system that will be activated first is the one that has the highest density of dislocations on the slip plane.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the slip system that will be activated first is:

1. The rod is 50 cm long, and the bottom of the rod is initially 30 cm away from the wall. This means the rod is inclined at an angle θ with respect to the horizontal, where:

tan(θ) = 30 cm / 20 cm = 1.5

θ ≈ 56.31° (using inverse tangent)

2. The bottom of the rod is pulled horizontally away from the wall at a rate of 4 cm/s. This means the rod is being rotated about its bottom end, and the top of the rod will start sliding down the wall.
3. Since the rod is being rotated, the angle θ will change. Let's find the rate of change of θ (dθ/dt) using the fact that the bottom of the rod is being pulled horizontally:

dθ/dt = (4 cm/s) / (20 cm) = 0.2 rad/s (approximately)

4. Now, we can use the concept of angular momentum to relate the rate of change of θ to the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod. Let's assume the mass of the rod is m and its moment of inertia about its bottom end is I. The angular momentum of the rod is:

L = I × ω

where ω is the angular velocity of the rod.

Since the rod is being rotated about its bottom end, the angular momentum is conserved. As the top of the rod starts sliding down the wall, the angular momentum remains constant, and the angular velocity ω increases.

5. Using the conservation of angular momentum, we can relate the rate of change of θ to the instantaneous velocity v of the top of the rod:

I × ω = I × (dθ/dt) = m × v × (30 cm)

where v is the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod.

6. Simplifying the equation, we get:

v = (I × dθ/dt) / m × (30 cm)

1. We are given the vapour pressure of pure zinc (pzn)° at 900K, which is 0.027 atm.
2. We are also given Henry's law coefficient (γzb)° for zinc at infinite dilution solution in lead on Raoultian scale, which is 8.55.
3. We need to find the partial pressure of zinc (Pzn) in equilibrium with a liquid lead solution containing 0.03 mole % zinc at 900K.

Since the solution is very dilute, we can assume that the activity of zinc in the solution is equal to its mole fraction. Therefore, the activity of zinc (aZn) is:

aZn = 0.0003 (since 0.03 mole % is equivalent to 0.0003 mole fraction)

4. According to Henry's law, the partial pressure of zinc (Pzn) is proportional to the activity of zinc:

Pzn = γzb ° × aZn

Substituting the values, we get:

Pzn = 8.55 × 0.0003
= 0.002565 atm

5. To convert the partial pressure from atm to torr, we multiply by the conversion factor:

The rate of oxidation of nickel is controlled by the rate of transport of oxygen through the concentration boundary layer. The rate of oxidation (in moles of nickel per minute (mol/min), rounded off to two decimal places) is";"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture:
The gas mixture contains 40% oxygen by volume, which is equivalent to a mole fraction of oxygen (xO2) of:

xO2 = 0.4

The total pressure is 1 atm, and the temperature is 1173 K. Using the ideal gas equation, we can calculate the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2):

PO2 = xO2 \* Ptotal
= 0.4 \* 1 atm
= 0.4 atm

2. Calculate the concentration of oxygen at the surface of the solid:
The concentration of oxygen at the surface of the solid is given as 0.

3. Calculate the boundary layer thickness (δ):
The boundary layer thickness is not given in the problem, but we can use the following relationship to estimate it:

δ = (D \* t)^(1/2)

where D is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the gas mixture, and t is the time.

For ideal gases, the diffusion coefficient is given by:

D = (1/3) \* (RT)^(2/3) \* (Ptotal)^(1/3)

where R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, and Ptotal is the total pressure.

Substituting the given values, we get:

D = (1/3) \* (8.205 × 10^(-5) m^3 atm^-1 mol^-1 \* (1173 K)^(2/3) \* (1 atm)^(1/3)
= 1.43 × 10^(-5) m^2 s^-1

Now, we can estimate the boundary layer thickness:

δ = (1.43 × 10^(-5) m^2 s^-1 \* t)^(1/2)

For a 50 mm diameter sphere, the surface area is:

A = 4 \* π \* (0.025 m)^2
= 0.0491 m^2

The mass transfer coefficient (k) is given as 0.03 m s^-1. The rate of oxidation (r) can be calculated using the following equation:

r = k \* A \* (C0 - Cs)

where C0 is the concentration of oxygen at the surface of the solid, and Cs is the concentration of oxygen at the surface of the gas mixture.

Substituting the given values, we get:

r = 0.03 m s^-1 \* 0.0491 m^2 \* (0 - 0.4 atm / (8.205 × 10^(-5) m^3 atm^-1 mol^-1 \* 1173 K))

[$h_N$] = K_N \* [wt.%N]

Substituting the expression for K_N, we get:

[$h_N$] = 10^[-518/T - 1.063] \* [wt.%N]

Now, we need to find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the pure liquid iron. We can do this by setting the activity of nitrogen equal to the activity of nitrogen in the atmosphere (which is 1, since the atmosphere is the standard state). We can write:

[$h_N$] = 1

Substituting the expression for [$h_N$], we get:

10^[-518/T - 1.063] \* [wt.%N] = 1

Dividing both sides by 10^[-518/T - 1.063], we get:

[wt.%N] = 10^(1.063 - 518/T)

Now, we can plug in the given temperature (1873 K) and calculate the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen:

[wt.%N] = 10^(1.063 - 518/1873) ≈ 0.001%

Rounded off to three decimal places, the answer is:

[wt.%N] ≈ 0.001%

Fluid;7;G-META-19-44;NUM;67;Assume Darcy’s law is applicable and g = 9.8 𝑚. $𝑠^(−2)$. Density of water = 1000 𝑘𝑔.$𝑚^(−3)$. Pressure drop in the granular zone of a blast furnace is 300 mm of water per meter of the bed height. The bed permeability is 0.8 $𝑚^(4).𝑁^(−1).𝑠^(−1)$ . The volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed [in $(𝑚^(3).𝑠^(−1)).𝑚^(−2)$ , rounded off to the nearest integer] is;"To solve this problem, we can use Darcy's law, which relates the pressure drop to the permeability and the flow rate of the fluid. The equation is:

Q = - (k \* A \* ΔP) / (μ \* L)

where:
Q = volumetric flow rate
k = permeability
A = cross-sectional area
ΔP = pressure drop
μ = dynamic viscosity
L = length of the bed

Given:
g = 9.8 m/s^2
density of water = 1000 kg/m^3
pressure drop = 300 mm of water per meter of bed height = 0.3 m of water per meter
bed permeability = 0.8 m^4/N/s
density of water = 1000 kg/m^3

First, we need to convert the pressure drop from mm of water to m of water. There are 10 mm in 1 cm, and 100 cm in 1 m, so:

0.3 m of water per meter = 0.3 m / 1 m = 0.3 m

Next, we can use the equation for Darcy's law to solve for the volumetric flow rate:

Q = - (k \* A \* ΔP) / (μ \* L)

We are given the permeability, pressure drop, and length of the bed, but not the cross-sectional area or dynamic viscosity. However, we can use the density of water to estimate the dynamic viscosity. The dynamic viscosity of water is approximately 0.001 Pa·s at room temperature.

Now we can plug in the values:

Q = - (0.8 m^4/N/s \* A \* 0.3 m) / (0.001 Pa·s \* 1 m)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Q = - 0.24 A m^3/s

To find the volumetric flow rate per unit area, we can divide by the cross-sectional area:

Q/A = - 0.24 m^3/s m^2

Material manufacturing;81;G-META-19-45;NUM;86;Given: Assume ideal gas behavior, and molar volume of the gas at NTP is 22.4 liter.  A blast furnace charged with hematite containing 90 wt.% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ produces liquid iron with 3.6 wt.% carbon. Coke containing 90 wt.% carbon is charged at a rate of 500 kg per Metric ton of liquid iron produced. The blast furnace top gas contains (by volume), 22% CO, 18% $CO_2$, and balance nitrogen. The volume of the blast furnace top gas [in $m^3$ (NTP), rounded off to the nearest integer] is;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The blast furnace produces liquid iron with 3.6 wt.% carbon. This means that for every 100 kg of liquid iron, 3.6 kg is carbon.
2. The coke contains 90 wt.% carbon, which means that for every 100 kg of coke, 90 kg is carbon.
3. The rate of coke charged is 500 kg per metric ton of liquid iron produced. Since 1 metric ton is equal to 1000 kg, the rate of coke charged is 0.5 kg of coke per kg of liquid iron produced.
4. Since 3.6 kg of carbon is present in 100 kg of liquid iron, the amount of carbon produced per kg of liquid iron is 0.036 kg/kg.
5. The rate of coke charged is 0.5 kg of coke per kg of liquid iron produced, and the coke contains 90 wt.% carbon. Therefore, the amount of carbon produced per kg of coke is 0.9 kg/kg.
6. Since the amount of carbon produced per kg of coke is 0.9 kg/kg, and the rate of coke charged is 0.5 kg of coke per kg of liquid iron produced, the total amount of carbon produced per kg of liquid iron is 0.9 kg/kg x 0.5 kg/kg = 0.45 kg/kg.
7. Since the amount of carbon produced per kg of liquid iron is 0.036 kg/kg, the excess carbon produced per kg of liquid iron is 0.45 kg/kg - 0.036 kg/kg = 0.414 kg/kg.
8. The blast furnace top gas contains 22% CO, 18% $CO_2$, and balance nitrogen. This means that the volume of CO and $CO_2$ in the top gas is 22% + 18% = 40% of the total volume.
9. The molar volume of the gas at NTP is 22.4 liter. Since the volume of the top gas is not given, we need to find the volume of the top gas in liters.
10. The volume of the top gas can be calculated as follows:

Volume of top gas (in liters) = Total volume of CO and $CO_2$ (in liters) / 0.4

Total volume of CO and $CO_2$ (in liters) = 40% of the total volume of the top gas (in liters)

Volume of CO and $CO_2$ (in liters) = 0.4 x Volume of top gas (in liters)

Substituting the value of the molar volume of the gas at NTP, we get:

Volume of top gas (in liters) = (0.4 x Volume of top gas (in liters)) / 0.4

Volume of top gas (in liters) = 22.4 liter

Rearranging the equation, we get:

Volume of top gas (in liters) = 56.0 liter

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the volume of the blast furnace top gas is:

Atomic weight of copper is 63. 100 Metric tons of copper concentrate containing 21 wt.% Cu is to be processed in 6 months with 25 working days per month and 8 working hours per day. The concentrate is leached by sulphuric acid and electrolyzed in 10 cells arranged in series. The minimum current rating (Ampere per month per cell, rounded off to the nearest integer) is?;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total number of grams of copper concentrate given.
Metric ton = 1000 kg
So, 100 metric tons = 1000000 grams (since 1 kg = 1000 grams)

2. Now, we find the total amount of copper in grams.
Percentage of Cu = 21 wt.%
Since 100 wt.% is equal to 100 grams, we can find the amount of Cu as:
21 wt.% Cu / 100 wt.% = 0.21 x 100 grams = 21 grams

3. Now, we find the total current needed to electrolyze the copper.
The Faraday constant (F) is given as 96500 Coulombs per gram-equivalent.
The atomic weight of copper is 63.5 g/equivalent.
So, the total amount of electrons required to electrolyze 21 grams of copper is:
Number of electrons = (21 grams) x (96500 Coulombs/gram-equivalent) / (63.5 g/equivalent) = 312,500 electrons

4. The time available for processing the copper concentrate is 6 months with 25 working days per month, and 8 working hours per day.
Total working days = 6 months x 25 days/month = 150 days
Total working hours = 150 days x 8 hours/day = 1200 hours

5. The total number of cells is 10, and these cells are arranged in series.

Now, let's find the minimum current rating (amps) per month per cell.

Number of electrons required for 1200 hours = Number of electrons required per hour x 1200 hours
Number of electrons per hour = 312,500 electrons / 1200 hours = 260 electrons/hour

Monthly electrons required = 48,000 electrons/month (assuming 1800 office hours in a month)

Current per cell = Monthly electrons required / Total number of cells
= 48,000 electrons/month / 10 cells
= 4800 amps/month / cell
= 800 amps (rounded off to the nearest integer, since 848 amps is not an option)

The associated stored energy (in 𝑴𝑱. $𝒎^(−𝟑)$, rounded off to one decimal place) is;"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the stored energy associated with dislocations:

U = μb²ρ

where μ is the shear modulus, b is the Burger's vector, and ρ is the dislocation density.

Given values:

μ = 82 GPa = 82 × 10^9 Pa
b = a/2[1 1 1] = 0.2856 nm / 2 [1 1 1] = 0.1428 nm
ρ = 10^(15) m^(-2)

First, we need to convert the Burger's vector from nanometers to meters:

b = 0.1428 nm × (1 m / 1000 nm) = 0.0001428 m

If the volume % of B is 25%, the elastic modulus (in GPa, rounded off to one decimal place) of the material is;"Since the material is loaded in the $$ direction, we can use the rule of mixtures to calculate the elastic modulus of the material. The rule of mixtures states that the elastic modulus of a composite is the sum of the elastic moduli of its constituents, weighted by their respective volumes.

The volume percentage of metal B is 25%, so the volume fraction of metal B can be written as:

V_B = 0.25 / 0.25 = 0.25

Substituting this value and the elastic moduli of metals A and B into the rule of mixtures, we get:

Liquid steel is kept in a graphite crucible, and equilibrium is established. This means that the carbon in the liquid steel is in equilibrium with the carbon in the graphite crucible.

At equilibrium, the activity of carbon in the liquid steel is equal to the activity of carbon in the graphite crucible. Since graphite is the standard state, the activity of carbon in graphite is defined as 1.0.

Since the activity of carbon in the liquid steel is equal to the activity of carbon in the graphite crucible, it is also equal to 1.0.

All other parameters remaining constant, the total solidification time (in seconds, rounded off to one decimal place) for a cylinder-shaped [radius = 1 cm and height = 6 cm] casting of the same metal, is;"Since the question is asking for the total solidification time for a cylinder-shaped casting, we need to find the volume of the cylinder.

The volume of a cylinder (V) is given by the formula:

V = πr²h

where r is the radius and h is the height.

In this case, the radius (r) is 1 cm and the height (h) is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

V = π(1)²(6)
= 3.14 × 1 × 6
= 18.84 cm³

Since the original cube-shaped casting had a volume of 27 cm³, the cylinder-shaped casting has a volume that is approximately 18.84 cm³, which is about 69.5% of the original volume.

Since the total solidification time is directly proportional to the volume of the casting, we can scale the original solidification time by the ratio of the volumes:

New solidification time = Original solidification time × (New volume / Original volume)

Energy input per unit length (E) = Power (P) / Traverse speed (v)

where P is the power consumed by the welding process, which is given by:

Given values:

P = V x I = 20 V x 400 C/s = 8000 W

Next, we can calculate the energy input per unit length:

E = P / v = 8000 W / 5 mm/s = 1600 J/mm

* Both spheres have the same diameter, so their volumes are the same.
* The thermal diffusivity of sphere X is 100*10^-6 m^2/s, and the thermal diffusivity of sphere Y is 25*10^-6 m^2/s.
* The center of sphere X reaches 800K in 1 hour, which means that the temperature gradient in sphere X is high enough to allow heat to diffuse quickly.
* The time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K is longer than 1 hour, since its thermal diffusivity is lower.

We can use the following formula to relate the thermal diffusivity to the time required for the center of the sphere to reach a certain temperature:

t ∝ (d^2 / α)

where t is the time, d is the diameter of the sphere, and α is the thermal diffusivity.

Since the diameter of both spheres is the same, we can cancel out the d^2 term. This leaves us with:

t ∝ 1/α

This means that the time required for the center of the sphere to reach 800K is inversely proportional to the thermal diffusivity.

Since the thermal diffusivity of sphere X is 100*10^-6 m^2/s, and the thermal diffusivity of sphere Y is 25*10^-6 m^2/s, we can conclude that the time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K is 4 times longer than the time required for the center of sphere X to reach 800K.

Since there are three independent elastic constants (two Poisson's ratios and one elastic modulus), we can show that the correct answer is:

(C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains. (D) recrytallize at lower temeperatures;"Based on the context, the correct answer is:

(C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains.

Here's a brief explanation:

* Cold-worked metal is characterized by a heavily deformed microstructure due to plastic deformation.
* Recrystallization is the process by which a cold-worked metal returns to its original grain size by the formation of new grains of unstrained metal.
* The energy barrier ( nucleation energy) for recrystallization is higher for cold-worked metals because of the increased density of defects and the higher energy state of the deformed microstructure.
* As a result, the metal possesses a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains, making it more difficult for recrystallization to occur.

List of answers:

* Correct answer: (C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains.
* Other options:
    + (A) A coarser recrystallized grain size: Incorrect. Cold-worked metal typically forms finer recrystallized grains due to the higher density of defects.
    + (B) Possess a lower driving force for recrystallization: Incorrect. The driving force for recrystallization is actually higher in cold-worked metals due to the higher energy state of the deformed microstructure.
    + (D) Recrytallize at lower temperatures: Incorrect. Cold-worked metals tend to recrystallize at higher temperatures due to the higher energy barrier for nucleation.";;D;0;
Mechanical;87;G-META-20-22;NUM;69;Given, fracture toughness $K_(1c)$ = 30 MPa$m^(1/2)$ and assume crack geometry factor of unity. A component subjected to tensile stress in a mechanical device is monitored periodically for cracks by NDT. The NDT technique can only detect cracks( both surface and internal) which are larger than 1mm. Keeping a 10% margin of safety, the maximum allowed tensile stress(MPa) on the component will be? (round off to the neareest integer).;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The fracture toughness is given as 30 MPa*m^(1/2).
2. The crack geometry factor is assumed to be unity, which means that the stress intensity factor (K) is equal to the fracture toughness (K_(1c)).
3. The NDT technique can only detect cracks larger than 1 mm. This means that any cracks smaller than 1 mm will not be detected.
4. To ensure a 10% margin of safety, we need to calculate the maximum allowed tensile stress that will prevent cracks from growing to a size larger than 1 mm.

Let's use the following formula to relate the maximum allowed tensile stress (σ) to the crack size (a):

σ = K / √πa

We are given that K = 30 MPa*m^(1/2) and a = 1 mm = 0.001 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

σ = 30 MPa*m^(1/2) / √π(0.001 m)
= 30 MPa*m^(1/2) / 0.00314 m^(1/2)
= 9.55 MPa

To ensure a 10% margin of safety, we need to reduce this value by 10%:

σ = 9.55 MPa - 0.955 MPa
= 8.595 MPa

Rounding this value to the nearest integer, we get:

If 200g of weight is lost over a period of 10 years, then the corrosion rate($kg.m^(2).year^(-1)$) is?(round off to the nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we need to find the corrosion rate in kg/m²/year. We are given the total exposed surface area of the iron plate, which is 50 cm². We are also given the weight lost over a period of 10 years, which is 200 g.

First, we need to convert the weight lost from grams to kilograms. There are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, so:

200 g = 0.2 kg

Next, we need to convert the total exposed surface area from cm² to m². There are 100 cm in 1 m, so:

50 cm² = 0.005 m² (since 1 m² = 10000 cm²)

Now we can find the corrosion rate. The corrosion rate is the weight lost per unit area per unit time. In this case, the unit area is m², and the unit time is year. We can find the corrosion rate by dividing the weight lost by the total exposed surface area and the time period:

Corrosion rate = (Weight lost) / (Total exposed surface area × Time period)
= (0.2 kg) / (0.005 m² × 10 years)
= 4 kg/m²/year

In cold-rolling, for the sheet to be drawn into rolls, the angel of contact(in degress) (or angle of bite) should be less than or equal to?(round off to one decimal places);"Based on the context provided, I will solve the question.

The coefficient of friction (μ) between the sheet and roll is given as 0.1. In cold-rolling, the angle of contact (or angle of bite) is critical to ensure that the sheet is drawn into the rolls. The angle of contact should be less than or equal to a certain value to prevent the sheet from being pushed back out of the rolls.

The angle of contact (θ) can be related to the coefficient of friction (μ) using the following equation:

tan(θ) = μ

Rearranging the equation to solve for θ, we get:

θ = arctan(μ)

Substituting the value of μ = 0.1, we get:

θ = arctan(0.1)

θ ≈ 5.7°

Therefore, the angle of contact (or angle of bite) should be less than or equal to 5.7° (rounded to one decimal place) for the sheet to be drawn into the rolls.

To answer this question, we need to analyze each option and determine which one is not feasible.

Option A: (1/2)[0 -1 1] → (1/6)[1 -2 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]

This reaction is feasible because the Burgers vector of the dislocation (1/2)[0 -1 1] can be decomposed into two smaller Burgers vectors (1/6)[1 -2 1] and (1/6)[-1 -1 2], which are both possible in a FCC crystal.

Option B: (1/2)[1 -1 0] + (1/2)[1 -1 0] → [1 -1 0]

This reaction is also feasible because the sum of two identical dislocations with the same Burgers vector (1/2)[1 -1 0] results in a single dislocation with the same Burgers vector [1 -1 0].

Option C: (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] → (1/2)[1 1 0]

This reaction is feasible because the Burgers vector of the dislocation (1/6)[1 1 -2] can be combined with the Burgers vector of the dislocation (1/3)[1 1 1] to form a new dislocation with the Burgers vector (1/2)[1 1 0].

Option D: (1/2)[-1 0 1] → (1/6)[-2 1 1 ] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]

This reaction is NOT feasible because the Burgers vector of the dislocation (1/2)[-1 0 1] cannot be decomposed into two smaller Burgers vectors (1/6)[-2 1 1 ] and (1/6)[-1 -1 2] that are both possible in a FCC crystal.

The cell discharges spontaneoulsy with a voltage of 0.5V. The ratio of the concentration of $[Fe^(+2)]$ to $[Zn^(+2)]$ ions in the cell is of the order of:  (A) $10^(-6)$ (B) $10^(-5)$ (C) $10^(6)$ (D) $10^(7)$;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cell discharges spontaneously with a voltage of 0.5 V, which means the cell reaction is:

Zn(s) + Fe^(+2)(aq) → Zn^(+2)(aq) + Fe(s)

The standard cell potential (E°) is the sum of the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions:

E° = E°(Zn^(+2)/Zn) + E°(Fe^(+2)/Fe)

E° = -0.76 V + (-0.44 V) = -1.20 V

Since the cell discharges spontaneously, the actual cell potential (E) is greater than the standard cell potential (E°). The difference is:

ΔE = E - E° = 0.5 V - (-1.20 V) = 1.70 V

2. The Nernst equation relates the cell potential to the concentrations of the ions:

ΔE = ΔE° - (RT/nF) \* ln(Q)

where ΔE° is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

Rearranging the equation to solve for Q, we get:

Q = exp((nFΔE)/(RT))

Substituting the values given, we get:

Q = exp((1 \* 96500 \* 1.70)/(8.314 \* 298)) ≈ 1.43 \* 10^(-5)

3. The reaction quotient (Q) is related to the concentrations of the ions by:

Q = [Zn^(+2)]^[Fe^(+2)]^(1)

where [Zn^(+2)] and [Fe^(+2)] are the concentrations of the ions.

Rearranging the equation to solve for the ratio of concentrations, we get:

[Zn^(+2)]/[Fe^(+2)] = 1/Q ≈ 1/1.43 \* 10^(-5) ≈ 6.97 \* 10^4

So, the ratio of the concentration of [Fe^(+2)] to [Zn^(+2)] ions in the cell is approximately 6.97 \* 10^4, which is of the order of 10^5.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, d is the distance between the planes of atoms in the crystal lattice, and θ is the Bragg angle.

We are given the wavelength of the X-ray (λ = 0.1543 nm) and the Bragg angle (θ = 24.65°). We can rearrange the Bragg equation to solve for d:

d = nλ / (2sinθ)

Since the crystal has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, the distance between the planes of atoms is given by:

d = a / √2

where a is the lattice parameter.

We can substitute this expression for d into the Bragg equation:

a / √2 = nλ / (2sinθ)

We are given that the first peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern corresponds to n = 1. Therefore:

a / √2 = (1)(0.1543 nm) / (2sin(24.65°))

To solve for a, we can first convert the Bragg angle to radians:

Since the eutectic reaction at 561°C has a composition of 36.9 wt.% Sn, and the alloy has a composition of 50 wt.% Sn, it's likely that the eutectic constituent present in the alloy is the liquid phase (L) at 561°C.

To find the amount of eutectic constituent, we can calculate the difference between the alloy composition and the eutectic composition:

50 wt.% Sn (alloy) - 36.9 wt.% Sn (eutectic) = 13.1 wt.% Sn

Assertion [a]: Low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often have additions of strong carbide-forming elements.

Reason [r]: During creep deformation, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix, lose coherency.

The reason seems to be related to the concept of misfit and coherency in materials science. When particles with a higher misfit with the matrix lose coherency, it means that the particles are no longer perfectly aligned with the surrounding matrix, which can affect their behavior during creep deformation.

The assertion [a] suggests that low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often have additions of strong carbide-forming elements. Carbide-forming elements, such as chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten, are known to form strong carbides with carbon, which can improve the creep resistance of steels.

Assertion (a): The rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution of B in A is controlled by the diffusivity of B.

Reason (r): Atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries.

To determine the correctness of the assertion and reason, we need to understand the process of homogenization in a solid solution.

Homogenization is the process of achieving a uniform distribution of solute atoms (B) in a solvent (A). In a dilute substitutional solid solution, the solute atoms occupy substitutional sites in the solvent lattice. The rate of homogenization is influenced by the diffusivity of the solute atoms, which is the ability of the atoms to move through the lattice.

The reason statement suggests that atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries. This is partially correct. While it is true that dislocations and grain boundaries can act as barriers to atomic migration, they can also play a role in facilitating diffusion. For example, dislocations can provide a pathway for atoms to move through the lattice, and grain boundaries can act as a sink or source for atoms.

Given this context, we can evaluate the assertion and reason:

* Assertion (a) is true. The rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution is indeed controlled by the diffusivity of the solute atoms.
* Reason (r) is partially true. While it is correct that dislocations and grain boundaries can affect atomic migration, it is not the only factor that controls the rate of homogenization.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

(B) Both [a] and [r] are true but [r] is not the correct reason for [a]";;D;0;

Atomic structure;94;G-META-20-40;NUM;40;Assume hard sphere model and radius of Fe atom as 0.124 nm. Radius(in nm) of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice is?(round off to three decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The radius of an Fe atom is given as 0.124 nm.
2. The distance between the center of two adjacent Fe atoms in the [111] direction is called the diameter of the octahedral void. This distance can be calculated using the lattice parameter (a) of the BCC structure.

The lattice parameter (a) of BCC iron is given by: a = √3/2 * r, where r is the Fe atom radius.

Plugging in the value of r = 0.124 nm, we get:

a = √3/2 * 0.124 nm = 0.286 nm

3. The diameter of the octahedral void (d) is equal to the lattice parameter (a) multiplied by √2.

d = √2 * a = √2 * 0.286 nm = 0.406 nm

4. To find the radius of the largest interstitial atom, subtract the diameter of the octahedral void from the radius of the Fe atom.

Radius of largest interstitial atom = Radius of Fe atom - Diameter of octahedral void
= 0.124 nm - 0.406 nm
= -0.282 nm (This value is negative, which is not physically meaningful. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of the interstitial atom radius.)

5. Since the octahedral void is a sphere, the largest interstitial atom that can fit inside it would be a sphere with a radius equal to half the diameter of the octahedral void.

Radius of largest interstitial atom = 0.406 nm / 2 = 0.203 nm

Since the magnitude of the answer is quite small (0.203 nm is approximately 20% of the radius of the Fe atom), we can assume that this is the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice.

Iron is corroding in fresh water which has dissolved oxygen concentration of 15mM. The anodic current density(in $A.cm^(-2)$) at an overpotential of 120 mV is?(round off to three decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the Tafel equation, which relates the anodic current density (i) to the overpotential (η) as follows:

i = i0 \* exp((η / b))

where i0 is the exchange current density, η is the overpotential, and b is the Tafel slope.

Given that the anodic Tafel slope is 0.06 V, we can convert this to a value in units of V/decade, which is:

b = 0.06 V / 0.05916 V/decade = 1.014 V/decade

We are also given the diffusion coefficient of oxygen (D = 2.42 \* 10^(-5) cm^2/s), the diffusion layer thickness (δ = 0.06 cm), and the dissolved oxygen concentration (C = 15 mM).

The anodic current density can be related to the diffusion coefficient and concentration using the following equation:

i = (n \* F \* D \* C) / δ

where n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule of oxygen, F is the Faraday constant, and δ is the diffusion layer thickness.

Substituting the given values, we get:

i = (4 \* 96,485 C/mol \* 2.42 \* 10^(-5) cm^2/s \* 15 mM) / 0.06 cm

i ≈ 0.00145 A/cm^2

To find the anodic current density at an overpotential of 120 mV, we can use the Tafel equation. First, we need to convert the overpotential to units of V/decade:

η = 120 mV / 0.05916 V/decade ≈ 2.03 V/decade

Then, we can plug in the values to get:

i = i0 \* exp((2.03 V/decade / 1.014 V/decade)) ≈ 0.00145 A/cm^2 \* exp(2.03)

i ≈ 0.00355 A/cm^2

Rounding off to three decimal places, the answer is:

Time taken(in seconds) for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is?(round off to two decimal places).;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The density of the oxide is given as 6.5 g/cm³. We need to find the mass of the oxide film that grows to a thickness of 2 µm.
2. The thickness of the oxide film is given as 2 µm, which is equal to 0.002 cm (since 1 µm = 0.001 cm).
3. The rate constant is given as 3 × 10^(-6) g²/cm⁴·s⁻¹. This means that the rate of growth of the oxide film is proportional to the square of the thickness and inversely proportional to the square of the time.
4. We can write the rate equation as:

dM/dt = k \* t^(-2) \* (2x)^2

where M is the mass of the oxide film, t is the time, k is the rate constant, and x is the thickness of the oxide film.

5. Since the thickness of the oxide film is constant at 0.002 cm, we can rewrite the equation as:

dM/dt = k \* (0.002)^2

6. The mass of the oxide film is given by:

M = ρ \* V

where ρ is the density of the oxide and V is the volume of the oxide film.

7. The volume of the oxide film is given by:

V = A \* x

where A is the area of the surface and x is the thickness of the oxide film.

8. Since the area of the surface is not given, we cannot find the exact value of M. However, we can find the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm.

9. We can rewrite the rate equation as:

dM/dt = k \* (0.002)^2

10. To find the time taken, we can integrate the rate equation with respect to time:

M = ∫[k \* (0.002)^2 dt]

11. Evaluating the integral, we get:

M = k \* (0.002)^2 \* t

12. Since the mass of the oxide film is given as 2 µm, we can set up the equation:

k \* (0.002)^2 \* t = 2

13. Solving for t, we get:

t = (2 / (3 × 10^(-6) \* (0.002)^2))^(1/2)

t ≈ 1.43 × 10^4 s

Rounded off to two decimal places, the answer is:

The enthalpy of the system at 1353 K is the enthalpy of melting minus the heat absorbed by the system as it cools from 1356 K to 1353 K. The heat absorbed can be calculated as:

Q = mcΔT

where m is the mass of copper, c is the specific heat capacity of copper, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

The enthalpy of the system at 1353 K is:

H = Hm - Q

where Hm is the enthalpy of melting.

The driving force for the transformation is the difference between the enthalpy of the system at 1353 K and the enthalpy of melting:

ΔH = H - Hm

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔH = (Hm - Q) - Hm
= -Q
= -mcΔT

where ΔT = 3 K (1356 K - 1353 K).

The specific heat capacity of copper is approximately 385 J/g·K. Let's assume a mass of 1 mole of copper (approximately 63.5 g).

Q = mcΔT
= (63.5 g) × (385 J/g·K) × (3 K)

1. The goal is to reduce the sulfur content in the steel from 0.03 wt.% to 0.015 wt.%.
2. The equilibrium sulfur partition ratio between the slag and steel is 50, which means that for every 1% sulfur in the steel, there will be 0.5% sulfur in the slag.
3. Let's assume the initial amount of sulfur in the steel is 0.03 wt.% S, which is 30 grams (0.03 x 1000 kg x 0.01).
4. To reduce the sulfur content to 0.015 wt.%, we need to remove 15 grams of sulfur (30 grams - 15 grams = 15 grams).
5. Since the sulfur partition ratio is 50, for every 1 gram of sulfur removed from the steel, 0.5 grams of sulfur will be removed from the slag.
6. Therefore, we need to remove 30 grams of sulfur from the steel, which corresponds to 15 grams of sulfur removed from the slag (30 grams / 0.5 grams/g).
7. The amount of slag needed can be calculated by dividing the amount of sulfur removed from the slag (15 grams) by the sulfur content in the slag (0.5 wt.% S).

Charge of electron is 1.6 * $10^(-19)A.s$ 5. Mobility of electron is 0.2 $m^(2).V^(-1).s^(-1)$. Zone refining of Si results in residual P content of 0.1 parts per billion by weight. The electrical conductivity($Ω^(-1).m^(-1)$) of this Zone refined Si is?(round off to two decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to calculate the electrical conductivity of the zone-refined Si.

Step 1: Calculate the number of atoms of Si in 1 gram of Si:

Density of Si = 2.33 g/cm³
Molar mass of Si = 28.09 g/mol (approximate value)

Number of moles of Si in 1 gram = 1 g / 28.09 g/mol = 0.0357 mol

Number of atoms of Si in 1 gram = 0.0357 mol x 6.02 x 10²³ atoms/mol = 2.15 x 10²² atoms

Step 2: Calculate the number of electrons in 1 gram of Si:

Number of electrons per atom of Si = 4 (since Si has 4 valence electrons)

Number of electrons in 1 gram of Si = 2.15 x 10²² atoms x 4 electrons/atom = 8.6 x 10²² electrons

Step 3: Calculate the electrical conductivity of the zone-refined Si:

Electrical conductivity (σ) = number of charge carriers (n) x mobility (μ) x charge of electron (e)

n = number of electrons in 1 gram of Si = 8.6 x 10²² electrons

μ = mobility of electron = 0.2 m²/V·s

The creep rate at a temperature of x K (round off to the nearest integer) will be 5 times the creep rate at 890 K. Find x.;"Let's analyze the given information:

* The steady state creep rate increases by a factor of 20 when the temperature is increased from 890 K to 980 K.
* This means that the creep rate at 980 K is 20 times the creep rate at 890 K.
* We want to find the temperature x at which the creep rate is 5 times the creep rate at 890 K.

Let's set up an equation based on the given information:

20 × creep rate at 890 K = creep rate at x K

We can rewrite this equation as:

creep rate at x K = 20 × creep rate at 890 K

Since we want to find the temperature x at which the creep rate is 5 times the creep rate at 890 K, we can set up another equation:

creep rate at x K = 5 × creep rate at 890 K

Now we have two equations:

20 × creep rate at 890 K = creep rate at x K
creep rate at x K = 5 × creep rate at 890 K

Equating the two expressions for creep rate at x K, we get:

20 × creep rate at 890 K = 5 × creep rate at 890 K

Dividing both sides by the creep rate at 890 K, we get:

20 = 5

This is a contradiction, which means that our assumption is incorrect. Let's try again.

Think about what happens when the temperature is increased from 890 K to 980 K. The creep rate increases by a factor of 20. If we go up by another unit of temperature (say, to 990 K), the creep rate will increase by a factor of 20 again (since the same trend continues). Therefore, we can expect the creep rate at 980 K to be 20 times the creep rate at 890 K. If we increase the temperature by another factor of 20 (say, to 1020 K), the creep rate will increase by another factor of 20, making it 5 times the creep rate at 890 K.

So, the correct answer is:

da/dN ∝ (ΔK)³

We are given that the crack length increases by a factor of two, which means that the new crack length is twice the original crack length. Let's call the original crack length ""a"" and the new crack length ""2a"".

We can write the relationship between the crack growth rate and stress intensity range for the original crack length as:

da/dN ∝ (ΔK)³

And for the new crack length, we can write:

2da/dN ∝ (2ΔK)³

Since the mean stress is zero, the stress intensity range ΔK is proportional to the stress amplitude. Let's call the stress amplitude ""σ"". Then, ΔK ∝ σ.

Substituting this into the equation for the new crack length, we get:

2da/dN ∝ (2σ)³

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by da/dN to get:

2 ∝ (2σ)³ / (σ)³

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2 ∝ 8σ²

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

In a top gated mold, liquid metal enters the mold cavity as freely falling stream under gravity from a height of 0.5m. Ignore the fluid friction due to viscosity and the drag due to changes in the direction of flow. If the volume of the mold cavity is 10 $m^3$, then the time(in seconds) required to fill the mold is?(roound off to nearest integer);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The liquid metal enters the mold cavity as a freely falling stream under gravity, so its initial velocity is 0 m/s.
2. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2, which is the downward acceleration.
3. The height from which the liquid metal falls is 0.5 m, so the initial potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as it falls.
4. The cross-sectional area of the gate is 0.2 m^2, which is the area through which the liquid metal flows.
5. The volume of the mold cavity is 10 m^3, which is the volume that needs to be filled.

To find the time required to fill the mold, we can use the concept of volume flow rate. The volume flow rate is the rate at which the liquid metal flows into the mold cavity, and it is given by:

Volume flow rate = Area × Velocity

Since the liquid metal is falling under gravity, its velocity increases as it falls. We can use the equation of motion to find the velocity at the bottom of the mold cavity:

v = √(2gh)

where v is the velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height from which the liquid metal falls (0.5 m).

v = √(2 × 9.8 × 0.5) = 4.43 m/s

Now we can find the volume flow rate:

Volume flow rate = 0.2 m^2 × 4.43 m/s = 0.886 m^3/s

The volume of the mold cavity is 10 m^3, so we can find the time required to fill it:

Time = Volume / Volume flow rate

1. The reaction is: [C]_(1 wt.% Henrian Std. State) + [O]_(1 wt.% Henrian Std. State) → (CO)_(1 atm. Std. State)
2. The equilibrium constant (K) is related to the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) by the equation: ΔG° = -RT ln K
3. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is zero: ΔG = 0
4. We can rewrite the equation for ΔG in terms of the equilibrium constant (K): ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q = 0

6. The problem gives us the value of ΔG°: ΔG° = -19840 - 40.65 T J
7. We need to find the value of [C] at equilibrium. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the concentration of CO (gas) is equal to the concentration of [C] and [O] (dissolved in the steel).
8. We can use Henry's law to relate the concentration of [C] and [O] to their partial pressures: [C] = HP_C / RT and [O] = HP_O / RT

10. The problem gives us the value of [O]: [O] = 0.03 wt.% = 0.03 g/100g = 0.0003 mol/g
11. We can use the value of [O] to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen (PO): PO = [O] × RT = 0.0003 mol/g × 14952 J/mol = 4.47 atm
12. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the partial pressure of CO (PCO) is equal to the partial pressure of oxygen (PO): PCO = PO = 4.47 atm
13. We can use the value of PCO to calculate the concentration of CO (gas): [CO] = PCO / RT = 4.47 atm / 14952 J/mol = 0.0003 mol/g
14. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the concentration of [C] is equal to the concentration of [CO]: [C] = [CO] = 0.0003 mol/g
15. Finally, we can convert the concentration of [C] from mol/g to wt.%: [C] = 0.0003 mol/g × 12.01 g/mol (atomic mass of C) = 0.0036 wt.%

For a material to exhibit superplasticity, one of the requirements is:

(C) Low strain-hardening exponent

Explanation: Superplasticity is a phenomenon where a material can be deformed at high temperatures and strains without significant hardening or necking.

(A) Oil> Water> Brine> Air (B) Brine> Oil> Water> Air (C) Brine> Water> Oil> Air (D) Water> Brine> Oil> Air;"To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of quenching power and its relationship with the quenchants used in heat treatment of steels.

Quenching power refers to the ability of a quenchant to rapidly cool the steel, which is essential in heat treatment processes such as hardening and tempering. The quenching power of a quenchant depends on its thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density.

In general, the quenching power of a quenchant increases with its thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, and decreases with its density. This means that quenchants with higher thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity can cool the steel more rapidly and effectively, while quenchants with lower density can penetrate deeper into the steel and provide more uniform cooling.

Based on these principles, we can evaluate the options:

(A) Oil > Water > Brine > Air: This sequence is incorrect because oil has a lower thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity than water, and brine has a lower thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity than oil. Air has the lowest thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity among all the options.

(B) Brine > Oil > Water > Air: This sequence is also incorrect because brine has a lower thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity than oil, and oil has a lower thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity than water.

Air has the lowest thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity among all the options.

(D) Water > Brine > Oil > Air: This sequence is incorrect because water has a lower thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity than brine, and brine has a lower thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity than oil.

* (B) Carbon

In the basic oxygen steel making process, the furnace is blown with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen to remove impurities and achieve the desired chemical composition. Carbon is the first element to oxidize in this process because it has a higher reactivity than the other elements listed.

Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are incorrect:

* (A) Silicon: Silicon has a lower reactivity than carbon and is typically removed from the steel through the process of deoxidation, which occurs later in the steel making process.
* (C) Manganese: Manganese is a more reactive element than silicon, but it is still less reactive than carbon. It is often added to the steel to remove sulfur and other impurities.

Atomic structure;82;G-META-21-15;NUM;60;Given: For the symmetric distribution: Probability P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98. The grain size (X) of annealed specimens follows a symmetric distribution with a mean (µ) of 5µm and a standard deviation (σ) of 0.5 µm. The percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6 µm is expected to be?(round off to nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we can use the given probability and the symmetric distribution to find the probability that the grain size is between 5µm and 6µm.

Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to µ + 2σ is equal to the probability that the grain size is greater than or equal to µ - 2σ.

We are given that P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = 0.98, so we can set up the following equation:

P(X ≤ µ + 2σ) = P(X ≥ µ - 2σ) = 0.98

Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability that the grain size is between µ - 2σ and µ + 2σ is equal to 0.98.

We can find the value of µ - 2σ by subtracting 2σ from µ:

µ - 2σ = 5µm - 2(0.5µm) = 4.5µm

So, the probability that the grain size is between 4.5µm and 5.5µm is 0.98.

To find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6µm, we can subtract the probability that the grain size is less than 5µm from the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 5.5µm:

P(5µm ≤ X ≤ 5.5µm) = P(X ≤ 5.5µm) - P(X ≤ 5µm)

We can find the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 5.5µm by subtracting the probability that the grain size is greater than 5.5µm from 1:

P(X ≤ 5.5µm) = 1 - P(X > 5.5µm)

Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability that the grain size is greater than 5.5µm is equal to the probability that the grain size is less than 4.5µm:

P(X > 5.5µm) = P(X < 4.5µm)

We can find the probability that the grain size is less than 4.5µm by subtracting the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 4.5µm from 1:

P(X < 4.5µm) = 1 - P(X ≤ 4.5µm)

We can find the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 4.5µm by using the given probability:

P(X ≤ 4.5µm) = P(X ≤ µ - 2σ) = 0.98

So, P(X < 4.5µm) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02

Now, we can find the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 5.5µm:

P(X ≤ 5.5µm) = 1 - P(X > 5.5µm) = 1 - P(X < 4.5µm) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98

Finally, we can find the percentage of specimens with grain size in the range 5 to 6µm:

P(5µm ≤ X ≤ 5.5µm) = P(X ≤ 5.5µm) - P(X ≤ 5µm)

We can find the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 5µm by subtracting the probability that the grain size is less than 5µm from 1:

P(X ≤ 5µm) = 1 - P(X > 5µm)

Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability that the grain size is greater than 5µm is equal to the probability that the grain size is less than 5µm:

P(X > 5µm) = P(X < 5µm)

We can find the probability that the grain size is less than 5µm by subtracting the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 5µm from 1:

P(X < 5µm) = 1 - P(X ≤ 5µm)

We can find the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 5µm by using the given probability:

P(X ≤ 5µm) = P(X ≤ µ) = 0.5

So, P(X < 5µm) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Now, we can find the probability that the grain size is less than or equal to 5.5µm:

P(X ≤ 5.5µm) = 0.98

The value of free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for liquid to solid transformation at 1058K is?(round off to nearest integer);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are given the melting point of Cu as 1358 K and its enthalpy of melting as 13400 J/mol.
2. We are also given that the enthalpy change for the liquid to solid transformation is equal to the enthalpy of melting.
3. We need to find the free energy change (ΔG) for the liquid to solid transformation at 1058 K.

The free energy change (ΔG) is related to the enthalpy change (ΔH) and the entropy change (ΔS) by the following equation:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Since we are given the enthalpy change (ΔH) as 13400 J/mol, we can use this value to find the free energy change (ΔG) at 1058 K.

First, we need to find the entropy change (ΔS) at the melting point (1358 K). We can use the following equation:

ΔS = ΔH / T_m

where T_m is the melting point in Kelvin.

Plugging in the values, we get:

ΔS = 13400 J/mol / 1358 K = 9.85 J/mol·K

Now, we can use the equation for free energy change (ΔG) to find the value at 1058 K:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
= 13400 J/mol - (1058 K) × (9.85 J/mol·K)
= 13400 J/mol - 10443.7 J/mol

For a given undercooling, if surface energy of a nucleus increases by 20%, the corresponding increase(in percent) in the critical radius of the nucleus is?(round off to nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we can use the following equation for the critical radius of a nucleus in homogeneous nucleation:

r_c = 2γ / (ΔG_v)

where r_c is the critical radius, γ is the surface energy, and ΔG_v is the change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume.

If the surface energy increases by 20%, the new surface energy can be written as:

γ' = γ + 0.20γ = 1.20γ

Substituting this into the equation for the critical radius, we get:

r_c' = 2(1.20γ) / (ΔG_v)

Comparing this to the original equation, we can see that the critical radius has increased by a factor of 1.20. To find the percentage increase, we can subtract 1 from this factor and multiply by 100:

(1.20 - 1) × 100% = 20%

If saturation magnetization of iron at room temperature is 1700 $kAm^(-1)$, then magnetic moment (in $Am^(2)$) per iron atom in the crystal is x * $10^(-23)$(round off to 1 decimal place).;"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for magnetic moment (μ) of a ferromagnetic material:

μ = M × V

where M is the saturation magnetization (in A/m) and V is the volume of the unit cell.

Given the lattice parameter of iron at room temperature is 0.287 nm, we can calculate the volume of the unit cell:

V = (0.287 nm)^3 = 0.0154 nm^3

The saturation magnetization of iron at room temperature is 1700 kAm^(-1) = 1.7 × 10^6 A/m.

This means that the first reflection corresponds to the (111) plane.

For a FCC crystal, the Bragg equation is given by:

2dsin(θ) = nλ

where d is the interplanar spacing, θ is the Bragg angle, n is an integer, and λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation.

For the (111) plane, the interplanar spacing (d) is given by:

d = a/√3

where a is the lattice parameter.

Substituting the value of θ = 30° and d = a/√3 into the Bragg equation, we get:

2(a/√3)sin(30°) = nλ

Simplifying the equation, we get:

a/√3 = nλ

Now, for the second reflection, the Bragg angle (θ) will be given by:

θ = arcsin(nλ/2d)

Substituting the value of d = a/√3, we get:

θ = arcsin(nλ/(2a/√3))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

θ = arcsin(n√3λ/(2a))

Since the Bragg angle is given in degrees, we need to convert the result to degrees:

θ = arcsin(n√3λ/(2a)) × 180/π

First, we need to determine the eutectoid composition, which is given as 0.8 wt.% C.

Next, we need to determine the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe, which is given as 0.025 wt.% C.

Since the steel sample is 0.6 wt.% C, which is less than the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe (0.025 wt.% C), all the carbon will be dissolved in the austenite (γ phase) at high temperatures.

As the steel sample cools, the austenite will transform into a mixture of proeutectoid ferrite (α phase) and pearlite. The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite can be calculated using the following formula:

f_alpha = (Fe_content_in_austenite / C_content_in_austenite) \* (Eutectoid_content - Carbon_content_in_austenite)

where f_alpha is the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite, Fe_content_in_austenite is the iron content in the austenite, C_content_in_austenite is the carbon content in the austenite, Eutectoid_content is the eutectoid composition (0.8 wt.% C), and Carbon_content_in_austenite is the carbon content in the austenite (0.6 wt.% C).

1. The degree of polymerization (DP) is the number of repeating units in a polymer chain. In this case, the DP of polyethylene is 30,000.
2. The molecular formula of polyethylene is CH2, since it's a hydrocarbon with alternating carbon and hydrogen atoms.
3. To find the molecular weight of polyethylene, we need to multiply the atomic weight of carbon (12 g/mol) by the number of carbon atoms in the repeating unit (1), and then add the atomic weight of hydrogen (1 g/mol) multiplied by the number of hydrogen atoms in the repeating unit (2).

Molecular weight of CH2 = 12 g/mol (carbon) + 2 g/mol (hydrogen) = 14 g/mol

The enthalpy (in KJ $mol^(-1)$) of vacancy formation is? (round off to 2 decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the relation between the vacancy concentration and the enthalpy of vacancy formation. When the temperature increases, the vacancy concentration doubles, which means the entropy of vacancy formation (ΔS) increases by ΔS = R \* ln(2). We are given that R = 8.314 J/mol·K, so:

ΔS = 8.314 J/mol·K \* ln(2) = 5.706 J/mol·K

The enthalpy of vacancy formation (ΔH) is related to the entropy by:

ΔH = ΔU + T \* ΔS
where ΔU is the internal energy change. Since ΔS is positive, ΔH will be higher than ΔU. We don't know ΔU, but we can ignore it since we're only interested in the order of magnitude.

The condition for getting the binary phase diagram of A-B (shown below) is:  (A) $ΔH_(mix)^(solid)$ = 0 and $ΔH_(mix)^(liquid)$ = 0 (B) $ΔH_(mix)^(solid)$ << 0 and $ΔH_(mix)^(liquid)$ = 0 (C) $ΔH_(mix)^(solid)$ > 0 and $ΔH_(mix)^(liquid)$ = 0 (D) $ΔH_(mix)^(solid)$ = 0 and $ΔH_(mix)^(liquid)$ << 0;"To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of the binary phase diagram shown. The diagram contains a small region of immiscibility, which means that it is not a perfect solution.

For a perfect solution, the enthalpy of mixing (ΔHmix) would be zero, regardless of whether it's solid or liquid. However, if there is a region of immiscibility, it's likely due to the opposite sign of the ΔHmix values for the solid and liquid.

Considering the shapes of the phase diagram, we can see that the solid and liquid phases are immiscible in a small region, indicating that there is a negative ΔHmix value for the solid (ΔHmix^(solid) < 0). For the liquid phase, the ΔHmix value is close to zero, which means ΔHmix^(liquid) ≈ 0.

From the context, we can conclude that:

* ΔHmix^(solid) << 0 (the enthalpy of mixing is negative and significant)
* ΔHmix^(liquid) ≈ 0 (the enthalpy of mixing is close to zero, indicating a perfect solution)

So, the correct answer is:

(B) ΔHmix^(solid) << 0 and ΔHmix^(liquid) ≈ 0";;B;1;

(D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation;"Based on the context, I will analyze the options and provide the correct answer.

Option A: An oversized solute atom would preferentially migrate below the slip plane of an edge dislocation

* This statement is TRUE. When an oversized solute atom is present near an edge dislocation, it tends to migrate to the region below the slip plane due to the attractive interaction between the solute atom and the dislocation.

Option B: A spherically symmetric point defect can interact with both the hydrostatic and shear stress fields of a dislocation

* This statement is TRUE. A spherically symmetric point defect, such as a vacancy or an interstitial, can interact with both the hydrostatic (normal) and shear stress fields of a dislocation, which are responsible for the dislocation's motion.

Option C: A point defect can locally modify the elastic modulus and thereby can change the interaction energy

* This statement is TRUE. The presence of a point defect can alter the local elastic modulus, which in turn affects the interaction energy between the point defect and the dislocation.

Option D: Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation

* This statement is FALSE. Vacancies are actually attracted towards the tensile region of a dislocation, not the compressive region. This is because the tensile region has a lower energy than the compressive region, making it more favorable for vacancies to migrate towards the dislocation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation";;B;0;
Mechanical;63;G-META-21-32;MCQS;67;A single crystal aluminium sample is subjected to uniaxial tension along [1 1 2] direction. If the applied tensile stress is 100 MPa and the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) is 25 MPa, which one of the following slip systems will be activated?  (A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1) (B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1) (C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1) (D) [0 1 1](1 1 -1);"To solve this problem, we need to identify the slip system that will be activated given the applied tensile stress and the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS).

The CRSS is the minimum stress required for slip to occur, and the applied stress is 100 MPa. Since the CRSS is 25 MPa, the resolved shear stress (RSS) on each slip system must be at least 25 MPa for it to be activated.

The resolved shear stress (RSS) on each slip system can be calculated using the following formula:

RSS = (1/2) \* |τ| \* |FS|

where τ is the shear stress, FS is the Frank-Schockley factor, and |·| denotes the absolute value.

The Frank-Schockley factor (FS) is the normalization factor that ensures the RSS is the same for all slip systems. It is given by:

FS = ||(b \* u)/d||

where b is the Burger's vector, u is the unit vector of slip direction, and d is the distance between the slip plane and the slip direction.

The given context does not provide the values of the Frank-Schockley factor, which are necessary to calculate the resolved shear stress. However, we can infer that the slip system with the highest RSS will be activated.

Slip system (A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1):

The Burger's vector (b) of slip system (A) is given by:

b = <1 1 1>

The unit vector (u) of slip direction is given by:

u = (1/√3) [1 1 1]

The distance (d) between the slip plane and the slip direction is given by:

d = √2

The Frank-Schockley factor (FS) of slip system (A) can be calculated using the formula:

FS = ||(b \* u)/d|| = ||(1 1 1) \* (1/√3) [1 1 1]/√2||

The resolved shear stress (RSS) of slip system (A) can be calculated using the formula:

RSS = (1/2) \* |τ| \* |FS|

Since the applied tensile stress (τ) is 100 MPa, and the CRSS is 25 MPa, the RSS of slip system (A) must be at least 25 MPa for it to be activated.

Slip system (B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1):

The Burger's vector (b) of slip system (B) is given by:

b = <1 1 -1>

The unit vector (u) of slip direction is given by:

u = (1/√3) [1 -1 0]

The distance (d) between the slip plane and the slip direction is given by:

d = √2

The Frank-Schockley factor (FS) of slip system (B) can be calculated using the formula:

FS = ||(b \* u)/d|| = ||(1 1 -1) \* (1/√3) [1 -1 0]/√2||

The resolved shear stress (RSS) of slip system (B) can be calculated using the formula:

RSS = (1/2) \* |τ| \* |FS|

Since the applied tensile stress (τ) is 100 MPa, and the CRSS is 25 MPa, the RSS of slip system (B) must be at least 25 MPa for it to be activated.

Slip system (C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1):

The Burger's vector (b) of slip system (C) is given by:

b = <1 0 -1>

The unit vector (u) of slip direction is given by:

u = (1/√3) [0 1 1]

The distance (d) between the slip plane and the slip direction is given by:

The Frank-Schockley factor (FS) of slip system (C) can be calculated using the formula:

FS = ||(b \* u)/d|| = ||(1 0 -1) \* (1/√3) [0 1 1]/√2||

The resolved shear stress (RSS) of slip system (C) can be calculated using the formula:

RSS = (1/2) \* |τ| \* |FS|

Since the applied tensile stress (τ) is 100 MPa, and the CRSS is 25 MPa, the RSS of slip system (C) must be at least 25 MPa for it to be activated.

Fluid;9;G-META-21-34;MCQS;78;For a fully developed 1-D flow of Newtonian fluid through a horizontal pipe of radius R (see figure), the axial velocity ($v_z$) is given by: $v_z$ = [ΔP/L]*({$R^2$ - $r^2$}/4µ), where ΔP is the pressure difference (P1- P2), µ is the viscosity, r is the radial distance from the axis and L is the length of the tube. The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is:  (A) ΔPR/(2L) (B) ΔPR/L (C) 3ΔPR/(2L) (D) 2ΔPR/L;"To solve this problem, we need to find the shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall. The shear stress (τ) is given by the formula:

τ = μ \* (dv_z/dr)

where μ is the viscosity, dv_z/dr is the derivative of the axial velocity with respect to the radial distance.

From the given equation for v_z, we can find the derivative:

dv_z/dr = ([ΔP/L] \* (-2r)/4µ)

Now, we can plug this into the formula for shear stress:

τ = μ \* (-2r/4µ) \* ([ΔP/L] \* ({R^2 - r^2}/4µ))

Simplifying the expression, we get:

τ = -[ΔP/L] \* (R^2 - r^2)/2L

At the tube wall (r = R), the shear stress is:

τ = -[ΔP/L] \* (R^2 - R^2)/2L

τ = 0

This means that the shear stress is zero at the tube wall. However, this is not the correct answer, as the question is asking for the shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall.

To find the correct answer, we need to consider the fact that the shear stress is proportional to the derivative of the velocity with respect to the radial distance. At the tube wall (r = R), the derivative is:

dv_z/dr = ([ΔP/L] \* (-2R)/4µ)

The shear stress is proportional to this derivative, so we can write:

τ ∝ dv_z/dr

τ ∝ ([ΔP/L] \* (-2R)/4µ)

The correct answer is:

(D) 2ΔPR/L

This is because the shear stress is proportional to the pressure difference (ΔP) and the radius of the tube (R), and inversely proportional to the length of the tube (L).";;A;0;

A blast furnace uses hematite ore with 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. It uses 600 kg coke per ton of hot metal. The coke contains 85% C and 15%ash. The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5%C. The weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal respectively, are: (Assume that the gangue materials of the ore and ash content of coke form slag while $Fe_(2)O_3$ in the ore is consumed in making hot metal)  (A) 1705 kg, 431 kg (B) 2131kg, 546 kg (C) 1705kg, 331kg (D) 1500kg, 431kg;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The blast furnace uses 600 kg of coke per ton of hot metal. Since the coke contains 85% C and 15% ash, the weight of carbon in the coke is:

600 kg x 0.85 = 510 kg

The weight of ash in the coke is:

600 kg x 0.15 = 90 kg

2. The hot metal contains 95.5% Fe and 4.5% C. The weight of iron in the hot metal is:

1000 kg x 0.955 = 955 kg

The weight of carbon in the hot metal is:

1000 kg x 0.045 = 45 kg

3. The hematite ore contains 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. The weight of $Fe_(2)O_3$ in the ore is:

1000 kg x 0.8 = 800 kg

The weight of gangue materials in the ore is:

1000 kg x 0.2 = 200 kg

4. The weight of iron ore used to produce 1 ton of hot metal is the weight of $Fe_(2)O_3$ in the ore minus the weight of iron in the hot metal:

800 kg - 955 kg = -155 kg (since you can't have a negative weight, this means that the iron ore used is more than 955 kg)

5. The weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal is the weight of gangue materials in the ore plus the weight of ash in the coke:

200 kg + 90 kg = 290 kg

However, this is not one of the answer options. Let's recalculate the weight of iron ore used:

The weight of iron in the hot metal is 955 kg. Since the hot metal contains 95.5% Fe, the weight of iron ore used is:

955 kg / 0.955 = 1000 kg

The weight of gangue materials in the ore is 200 kg. Therefore, the weight of iron ore used is:

1000 kg - 200 kg = 800 kg

This is option C, 1705 kg is not correct.

A continous fillet weld is made using a 3000 W welding machine. At a travel speed of 6 mm $s^(-1)$, the cross-sectional area(in $mm^2$) of the weld is?(round off to nearest integer);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The unit energy required to melt the metal is given as 6 J/mm³.
2. The heat transfer factor is 0.6, which means that only 60% of the energy is effectively transferred to the metal.
3. The melting factor is 0.5, which means that only 50% of the metal is melted.
4. The total energy transferred to the metal can be calculated as:

Total Energy = Power of welding machine x Time

= 3000 W x (Cross-sectional area x Travel speed)

= 3000 W x (Cross-sectional area x 6 mm/s)

5. Since only 60% of the energy is effectively transferred, the actual energy transferred to the metal is:

Actual Energy = 0.6 x Total Energy

6. Since only 50% of the metal is melted, the energy required to melt the metal is:

Energy required to melt = 0.5 x Actual Energy

7. The energy required to melt the metal is given as 6 J/mm³. Since the actual energy transferred is equal to the energy required to melt, we can set up the equation:

Energy required to melt = Actual Energy

6 J/mm³ = 0.5 x 0.6 x (3000 W x Cross-sectional area x 6 mm/s)

8. Simplifying the equation, we get:

6 J/mm³ = 9 W x Cross-sectional area

9. Cross-sectional area can be calculated as:

Cross-sectional area = 6 J/mm³ / 9 W

The surface area of a sphere (spherical mold) is given by:

A = 4πr^2 = 4π(6cm)^2 = 288.28 cm^2

The surface area of a cube (cubical mold) is given by:

A = 6l^2 = 6(12cm)^2 = 864 cm^2

The ratio of the surface areas is:

288.28 cm^2 / 864 cm^2 = 0.33

Since the surface area of the spherical mold is 0.33 times the surface area of the cubical mold, the solidification time will also be proportional to this ratio. Therefore, the solidification time in the cubical casting will be:

60 minutes / 0.33 = 182 minutes

True strain is a measure of the deformation of a material during a process like hot forging. It is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the initial length of the material.

For a 60% height reduction of a sample subjected to hot forging, we can calculate the true strain as follows:

Let the initial height of the sample be 'h0' and the final height be 'h1'.

The height reduction is 60%, so the final height is 40% of the initial height:

h1 = 0.4h0

The true strain (ε) can be calculated as:

ε = ln(h1/h0) = ln(0.4h0/h0) = ln(0.4)

ε ≈ 0.51

Assume Cu and $Cu_(2)S$ are pure solids. For the equlibrium reaciton: 2Cu(s) + $SO_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s) + $O_2$(g), the value of ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) at 973K is?(round off to 2 decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can start by writing the equilibrium constant expression for the given reaction:

K = ($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$)^(1/2) × ($P_(Cu_2S)$/$P_(Cu)^2$)

We are given that ΔG° at 973 K = -100 kJ for the reaction 2Cu(s) + 0.5$S_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s), which means that the reaction is spontaneous. This also means that the equilibrium constant K is greater than 1.

We are also given that ΔG° at 973 K = 292 kJ for the reaction $SO_2$(g) = 0.5$S_2$(g) + $O_2$(g), which means that the reaction is non-spontaneous. This also means that the equilibrium constant K for this reaction is less than 1.

Since the reaction 2Cu(s) + $SO_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s) + $O_2$(g) is a combination of the two reactions, we can use the given ΔG° values to calculate the equilibrium constant K for this reaction.

ΔG° = ΔG°(2Cu(s) + 0.5$S_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s)) + ΔG°($SO_2$(g) = 0.5$S_2$(g) + $O_2$(g))

ΔG° = -100 kJ + 292 kJ = -192 kJ

Since ΔG° is negative, the reaction is spontaneous, and the equilibrium constant K is greater than 1.

Now, we can use the equation:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

to calculate the value of ln K:

ln K = ΔG° / (RT)

ln K = -192 kJ / (8.314 J/mol·K × 973 K)

ln K ≈ -23.4

Since K is greater than 1, we can take the logarithm of both sides to get:

ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) = 1/2 × ln K

ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) = 1/2 × (-23.4)

ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) ≈ -11.7

The work done(in Joules) by the gas is?(round off to nearest integer)";"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The gas is initially at 10 atm and 300 K, so the initial temperature is 300 K.
2. The gas undergoes reversible adiabatic expansion, which means that the expansion is slow and there is no heat transfer between the gas and the surroundings.
3. The final pressure is 1 atm, which is equivalent to 101325 Pa.
4. The ideal gas equation of state is PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.
5. Since the expansion is adiabatic, the temperature remains constant, so T = 300 K.
6. The initial pressure is 10 atm, so P1 = 10 × 101325 Pa = 1013250 Pa.
7. The final pressure is 1 atm, so P2 = 101325 Pa.
8. The volume ratio is given by P1V1/P2V2 = (P1/P2), since the temperature is constant.
9. The initial volume is unknown, but we can find it using the ideal gas equation: P1V1 = nRT.
10. Rearranging the equation to solve for V1, we get V1 = nRT/P1.
11. Substituting the values, we get V1 = n × 8.314 J/mol·K × 300 K / (1013250 Pa).
12. Simplifying, we get V1 = 0.0252 L/mol.
13. The volume ratio is then given by V1/V2 = P2/P1 = 101325 Pa / 1013250 Pa = 1/10.
14. The work done by the gas is given by W = -Pext × ΔV, where Pext is the external pressure and ΔV is the change in volume.
15. Since the expansion is reversible, the external pressure is equal to the final pressure, Pext = 101325 Pa.
16. The change in volume is given by ΔV = V1 - V2, where V1 and V2 are the initial and final volumes, respectively.
17. Substituting the values, we get ΔV = 0.0252 L/mol - (0.0252 L/mol / 10) = 0.0224 L/mol.
18. The work done is then given by W = -Pext × ΔV = -101325 Pa × 0.0224 L/mol = -2273.5 J/mol.

If the spacing between the precipitates is increased to 0.5 µm, the shear stress (in MPa)  to bow the dislocation would be?(round off to nearest integer);"Let's analyze the problem:

* The shear stress required to bow a dislocation line is 100 MPa when the spacing between precipitates is 0.2 µm.
* The spacing between precipitates is increased to 0.5 µm.

Since the spacing between precipitates increases, the force required to bow the dislocation line will decrease. This is because the dislocation line has more space to move and is less constrained.

We can use the concept of force and distance to relate the shear stress to the spacing between precipitates. Specifically, the force required to bow the dislocation line is proportional to the inverse of the spacing between precipitates.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

F ∝ 1/d

where F is the force and d is the spacing between precipitates.

Since the force is proportional to the inverse of the spacing, when the spacing increases, the force decreases. Therefore, the shear stress required to bow the dislocation line will also decrease.

To find the new shear stress, we can set up a proportion:

100 MPa / 0.2 µm = x MPa / 0.5 µm

where x is the new shear stress.

If the Poisson's ratio is 0.3, the ratio of $σ_(zz)/σ_(xx)$ is?(round off to 1 decimal place).;"Since the metal plate is in a state of plane strain, the strain in the z-direction (εzz) is zero. This means that the stress in the z-direction (σzz) is also zero, since stress is proportional to strain.

The given condition σxx = σyy implies that the stress in the x-direction is equal to the stress in the y-direction. Since the plate is in a state of plane strain, the stress in the z-direction is zero. Therefore, the stress tensor can be written as:

σxx = σyy ≠ 0
σzz = 0
τxy = τxz = τyz = 0

The Poisson's ratio (ν) is defined as the ratio of the lateral strain to the longitudinal strain. Since the plate is in a state of plane strain, the lateral strain (εy) is equal to the longitudinal strain (εx). Therefore, the Poisson's ratio can be written as:

ν = -εy/εx

Substituting the given value of Poisson's ratio (ν = 0.3), we get:

0.3 = -εy/εx

Simplifying the equation, we get:

εy = -0.3εx

Since the stress in the x-direction is equal to the stress in the y-direction, the strain in the x-direction is equal to the strain in the y-direction. Therefore, we can write:

εx = εy

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

-0.3εx = εx

Simplifying the equation, we get:

εx = 0

This implies that the longitudinal strain (εx) is zero. Since the lateral strain (εy) is equal to the longitudinal strain (εx), the lateral strain (εy) is also zero.

The maximum applied stress(in Mpa) that the plate can sustain in mode I is?(round off to nearest integer);"A classic problem in linear elastic fracture mechanics!

Given:

* Fracture toughness, $K_{1c}$ = 20 MPa $m^{1/2}$
* Crack length, $a$ = 80/π mm = 25.5 mm (approximately)

We can use the following formula to find the maximum applied stress:

$$\sigma_{max} = \frac{K_{1c}}{Y\sqrt{\pi a}}$$

where $Y$ is a geometric factor that depends on the crack shape and the plate geometry. For a central through-thickness crack in an infinite plate, $Y$ is equal to 1.

Plugging in the values, we get:

$$\sigma_{max} = \frac{20 \text{ MPa } m^{1/2}}{1 \times \sqrt{\pi \times 0.0255 \text{ m}}} = 40.4 \text{ MPa}$$

Material Applications;49;G-META-21-5;MCQS;24;Single crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloys for aero-engines are manufactured using:  (A) Investment casting (B) Die casting (C) Squeeze casting (D) Directional solidification ;"Based on the context, I can answer the question as follows:

The correct answer is (D) Directional solidification.

Directional solidification is a process used to manufacture single crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloys for aero-engines. This process involves slowly solidifying the molten metal in a controlled manner to produce a single crystal structure, which is essential for the high-temperature and high-stress applications in aero-engines.

The other options are not correct because:

* Investment casting is a process used to manufacture complex shapes, but it is not typically used to produce single crystal turbine blades.
* Die casting is a process used to manufacture high-volume, low-cost parts, but it is not suitable for producing high-temperature and high-stress components like turbine blades.
* Squeeze casting is a process used to produce high-strength and high-temperature components, but it is not typically used to produce single crystal turbine blades.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Directional solidification.";;D;1;
Electrical;34;G-META-21-52;NUM;70;Given: $β_c$ = 0.1V per decade of current density. Exchange current density of hydrogen on iron surface = $10^(-9)$ A $cm^(-2)$, R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$, F = 96500 C $mol^(-1)$. All potentials are with reference to standard hydrogen electrode. At 25°C, iron corrodes in a dearated acid of pH 3 with a corrosion current density of 4 µA $cm^(-2)$. The corrosion potential (V) is?(round off to 2 decimal places).;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The corrosion current density is given as 4 µA/cm², which is equivalent to 4 × 10⁻⁶ A/cm².
2. The exchange current density of hydrogen on the iron surface is given as 10⁻⁹ A/cm².
3. The corrosion potential (Ecorr) is related to the corrosion current density (icorr) and the exchange current density (ie0) by the following equation:

Ecorr = E⁰ + (RT/nF) \* ln(ie0/icorr)

where E⁰ is the standard potential of the reaction, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, and F is the Faraday constant.

4. Since the reaction is the corrosion of iron, the standard potential (E⁰) is not given. However, we can use the given values to calculate the corrosion potential.

5. First, let's calculate the value of (RT/nF):

(RT/nF) = (8.314 J/mol·K \* 298 K) / (1 e- / 1 mol·e-) \* (96500 C/mol) ≈ 0.0257 V

6. Now, we can plug in the values into the equation:

Ecorr = E⁰ + (0.0257 V) \* ln(10⁻⁹ A/cm² / 4 × 10⁻⁶ A/cm²)

Ecorr ≈ E⁰ - 0.0257 V \* (-9) ≈ E⁰ + 0.2293 V

7. Since the corrosion potential is with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode, we can set E⁰ = 0 V.

8. Therefore, the corrosion potential is:

Ecorr ≈ 0 V + 0.2293 V ≈ 0.23 V

Rounded off to 2 decimal places, the answer is:

Atomic structure;97;G-META-21-53;NUM;38;Assume the radius of Fe atom to be 0.124 nm. The radius of an interstitial atom which just fits(without distorting the structure) inside an octahedral void of a bcc-iron crystal (in nm) is?(round off to 3 decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the octahedral void in a bcc-iron crystal.

In a bcc lattice, the radius of the octahedral void is given by:

r_void = r_atom * √3/2

where r_atom is the radius of the atom.

Given the radius of the Fe atom is 0.124 nm, we can calculate the radius of the octahedral void as:

r_void = 0.124 nm * √3/2
= 0.124 nm * 1.732/2
= 0.107 nm

So, the radius of the interstitial atom which just fits (without distorting the structure) inside an octahedral void of a bcc-iron crystal is 0.107 nm.

Nickel undergoes isothermal oxidation at 800K for a duration of 400s resulting in a weight gain of 2mg $cm^(2)$. The weight gain (mg $cm^2$) after a duration of 1600s is?(round off to nearest integer).;"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given that the weight gain is proportional to the square root of time. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Weight gain ∝ √t

where t is the time in seconds.

We are also given that the weight gain after 400s is 2 mg/cm². Let's denote the weight gain after 400s as W1. Then, we can write:

W1 ∝ √400

We can simplify this equation by substituting the value of 400:

W1 ∝ 20

Now, we can write an equation for the weight gain after 400s:

W1 = k × 20

where k is a constant of proportionality.

We are given that W1 = 2 mg/cm², so we can substitute this value into the equation:

2 = k × 20

To find the value of k, we can divide both sides by 20:

k = 2/20 = 0.1

Now that we have found the value of k, we can use it to find the weight gain after 1600s. Let's denote the weight gain after 1600s as W2. Then, we can write:

W2 ∝ √1600

We can simplify this equation by substituting the value of 1600:

W2 ∝ 40

Now, we can write an equation for the weight gain after 1600s:

W2 = k × 40

Substituting the value of k, we get:

W2 = 0.1 × 40

W2 = 4 mg/cm²

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the weight gain after 1600s is:

(A) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$ (B) If $ΔH_(mix)$ = 0, then $a_B$ > $X_B$ (C) If $ΔH_(mix)$ > 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$ (D) If $ΔH_(mix)$ < 0, then $a_B$ < $X_B$;"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of regular solution theory, which states that the enthalpy of mixing (ΔHmix) is related to the activity coefficient (γ) of the solute (B) by the following equation:

ΔHmix = xB \* RT \* γ

where xB is the mole fraction of B, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and γ is the activity coefficient of B.

Since the elements A and B have the same crystal structure, the enthalpy of mixing is zero. This means that the energy of mixing is zero, and the solution is ideal.

For an ideal solution, the activity coefficient is equal to 1, which means that the activity of B (aB) is equal to its mole fraction (xB). This is because the energy of mixing is zero, and the solution behaves like a mixture of ideal gases.

Therefore, if ΔHmix = 0, then aB = xB. So, the correct answer is:

(A) True stress is always higher than the engineerig stress. (B) At the ultimate stress point on the true stress-strain curve, dσ/dε = 0 (C) Resilience is the area under the elastic region of the engineering stress-strain curve. (D) Maximum true stress does not correspond to the maximum load.;"Let's analyze the options:

(A) True stress is always higher than the engineering stress: This is true. True stress is the actual stress in the material, taking into account the change in volume due to plastic deformation. Engineering stress, on the other hand, is the stress calculated based on the original cross-sectional area. Since the material's volume decreases during plastic deformation, the true stress is always higher than the engineering stress.

(B) At the ultimate stress point on the true stress-strain curve, dσ/dε = 0: This is false. At the ultimate stress point, the material is about to fail, and the stress-strain curve is typically concave upwards. This means that the derivative of stress with respect to strain (dσ/dε) is positive, not zero.

(C) Resilience is the area under the elastic region of the engineering stress-strain curve: This is false. Resilience is the area under the entire stress-strain curve, not just the elastic region. It represents the energy absorbed by the material during deformation.

(D) Maximum true stress does not correspond to the maximum load: This is true. The maximum true stress occurs at the point where the material is about to fail, which is typically not the same point as the maximum load. The maximum load occurs when the material is still in the elastic region, whereas the maximum true stress occurs when the material is in the plastic region.

(D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion;"Based on the given context, I will solve the question.

Creep deformation refers to the gradual deformation of materials under constant stress over extended periods of time.

Option A: The minimum creep rate is not typically obtained in the primary stage (stage I) of creep deformation. The primary stage is characterized by a rapid increase in strain rate, not the minimum creep rate.

Option B: The creep resistance actually increases with a decrease in grain size due to the grain boundary resistance to dislocation motion.

Option C: Coble creep indeed occurs via grain boundary diffusion.

Option D: Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion.

Strain hardening is a phenomenon where the material becomes stronger as it is deformed. This is typically represented by a positive slope in the true stress-true strain curve.

Necking instability occurs when the material becomes weaker as it is deformed, leading to a reduction in the cross-sectional area of the material. This is typically represented by a negative slope in the true stress-true strain curve.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = 0: This represents a point of maximum stress, where the material is no longer deforming. This is not related to necking instability.

(B) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = ϵ: This is not a valid mathematical expression, as 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 is a derivative of stress with respect to strain, not a product of stress and strain.

(C) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = σ: This represents a point where the material is no longer deforming, but it's not necessarily related to necking instability.

(D) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = ∞: This represents a point of infinite slope, which is not physically possible. However, it's related to the concept of instability, as it would indicate a sudden change in the material's behavior.

(A) Both c and a increase (B) c increases but a decreases (C) c decreases but a increases (D) Both c and a decrease;"Based on the context, I'll provide an answer.

The question is asking about the effect of increasing carbon content (up to 2 mass%) on the lattice parameters (c and a) of BCT (Body-Centered Tetragonal) martensite in Fe-C alloys.

As the carbon content increases, the lattice parameters of BCT martensite change. Specifically:

* The 'c' parameter (the distance between the planes perpendicular to the tetragonal axis) increases, while
* The 'a' parameter (the distance between the planes parallel to the tetragonal axis) decreases.

This is because the addition of carbon atoms to the Fe lattice leads to a more compact arrangement, causing the 'c' parameter to increase and the 'a' parameter to decrease.

* Mode I (P): Tensile opening mode, where the crack opens due to a normal stress perpendicular to the crack plane.
* Mode II (Q): In-plane shear mode, where the crack slides due to a shear stress parallel to the crack plane.

Mold flux is a substance used in continuous casting of steel to improve the casting process. Its primary functions are:

1. **Inclusion control**: Mold flux helps to remove impurities and inclusions from the molten steel, resulting in a cleaner and more consistent product.
2. **Reducing solidification shrinkage**: Mold flux can reduce the shrinkage of the steel as it solidifies, which helps to minimize porosity and improve the overall quality of the cast product.
3. **Lubrication**: Mold flux can also provide some lubrication between the mold and the solidifying steel, helping to reduce friction and prevent sticking.

However, mold flux is not primarily used for:

* Nickel (Ni) is an austenite stabilizer, which means it increases the M_s (critical transformation point) temperature. Austenite is a face-centered cubic crystal structure, whereas M_s represents the temperature above which the steel transforms from ferrite (a bcc structure) to austenite. Therefore, the correct statement is:

(A) It increases the $M_s$ temperature

(A) Fine grain size (B) FCC crystal structure (C) High melting point (D) Cold worked microstructure ;"Based on the context, I'll analyze the options to determine the desirable characteristic(s) for achieving better creep resistance in a material for high-temperature applications.

* Fine grain size (A): Grain size can affect the material's creep resistance. A finer grain size can lead to improved creep resistance due to the reduced grain boundary area, which can act as a site for creep deformation.
* FCC crystal structure (B): The face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure is not inherently related to creep resistance. Some materials with FCC structures, like copper, can exhibit high creep rates, while others, like nickel, can exhibit low creep rates.
* High melting point (C): A high melting point is not directly related to creep resistance. While a high melting point can indicate a material's ability to withstand high temperatures, it does not necessarily imply better creep resistance.
* Cold worked microstructure (D): Cold working can introduce defects and dislocations in the material, which can lead to improved creep resistance. This is because the defects and dislocations can act as obstacles to dislocation movement, reducing the material's ability to deform under creep conditions.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

* A: Fine grain size
* D: Cold worked microstructure

Both fine grain size and cold worked microstructure can contribute to improved creep resistance in a material for high-temperature applications.";;B,C;0;

(A) 𝜖̇ ∝ $𝑣^2$ (B) 𝜖̇ ∝ 𝑣 (C) 𝜖̇ ∝ $𝜌^2$ (D) 𝜖̇ ∝ 𝜌;"The Orowan equation for plastic flow due to dislocation movement is:

ε̇ = ρbvl

where ε̇ is the strain rate, ρ is the dislocation density, b is the Burgers vector, v is the dislocation velocity, and l is the mean free path of the dislocations.

From this equation, we can see that:

* ε̇ is proportional to ρ (since ρ is a factor in the equation)
* ε̇ is proportional to v (since v is a factor in the equation)
* ε̇ is not proportional to v^2 (since v is not squared in the equation)
* ε̇ is not proportional to ρ^2 (since ρ is not squared in the equation)

Therefore, the correct answer is:

* (B) ε̇ ∝ v
* (D) ε̇ ∝ ρ

Option A: Among all radiation emitted by an ideal black body at room temperature, the most intense radiation falls in the visible light spectrum

This statement is FALSE. Black body radiation at room temperature (around 300 K) peaks in the infrared region, not in the visible light spectrum.

Option B: The total emissive power of an ideal black body is proportional to the square of its absolute temperature

This statement is TRUE. According to Wien's displacement law and Stefan-Boltzmann's law, the total emissive power of an ideal black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (E ∝ T^4), not the square.

Option C: The emissive power of an ideal black body peaks at a wavelength λ which is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature

This statement is TRUE. According to Wien's displacement law, the peak wavelength (λ) of black body radiation is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (λ ∝ 1/T).

Option D: The radiant energy emitted by an ideal black body is greater than that emitted by the non-black body at all temperatures above 0 K

This statement is TRUE. An ideal black body is defined as an object that absorbs all incident radiation, whereas a non-black body reflects or transmits some radiation. As a result, an ideal black body emits more radiation than a non-black body at all temperatures above 0 K.

(A) Stick-out length: This parameter affects the heat input and the melting rate of the consumable wire. A longer stick-out length can lead to a slower melting rate, as the wire has to travel a longer distance before being melted.

(B) Welding speed: This parameter directly affects the melting rate of the consumable wire. A higher welding speed can lead to a faster melting rate, as the wire is being melted at a faster rate.

(C) Welding current: This parameter also directly affects the melting rate of the consumable wire. A higher welding current can lead to a faster melting rate, as more heat is being generated.

(D) Diameter of the consumable wire: This parameter does not directly affect the melting rate of the consumable wire. The diameter of the wire only affects the amount of material being melted, not the rate at which it's being melted.

(Note: B is the center of the sphere and the straight horizontal line OAB intersects the surface of the sphere at the point A.)   (A) The velocity of the fluid at the point A is zero (B) The fluid pressure at the point A exceeds that at point O by the amount 𝜌$v^2$/2 , where 𝒗 is the fluid velocity at point O (C) Fluid moving precisely along OA will turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object (D) On each side of the central streamline OA, the flow will be deflected round the object;"Based on the given context, we can analyze the situation:

* The fluid is inviscid and incompressible, which means it has no viscosity and its density remains constant.
* The flow is horizontal, slow, steady, and fully developed far from the object.
* The object is a smooth solid sphere, which means there are no irregularities or obstacles on its surface.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

* Since the flow is fully developed far from the object, the velocity of the fluid at point O is constant and parallel to the streamline OA.
* As the fluid approaches the object, the velocity of the fluid at point A will decrease due to the presence of the object, but it will not be zero. This is because the object is smooth and there are no obstacles on its surface to create a significant pressure gradient.
* The pressure at point A will be higher than at point O due to the presence of the object. This is because the fluid is being deflected around the object, creating a pressure gradient. The pressure difference between point A and point O can be calculated using Bernoulli's equation, which states that the sum of the pressure and kinetic energy per unit volume of a fluid is constant along a streamline. In this case, the pressure at point A will be higher than at point O by an amount equal to ρv^2/2, where v is the fluid velocity at point O.
* Fluid moving precisely along OA will not turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object. Instead, it will be deflected around the object, creating a curved streamline.
* On each side of the central streamline OA, the flow will be deflected around the object, creating a curved streamline.

Based on these deductions, the correct answer is:

* (B) The fluid pressure at the point A exceeds that at point O by the amount ρv^2/2, where v is the fluid velocity at point O.
* (D) On each side of the central streamline OA, the flow will be deflected round the object.

If the pressure(in bar) outside the bubble is 1.5 bar, the pressure inside the bubble  is? (round off to 1 decimal place).;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are given that 1 bar = 10^5 Pa.

3. The problem states that a spherical gas bubble of radius 0.01 mm is entrapped in molten steel held at 1773 K.
4. The pressure outside the bubble is given as 1.5 bar.
5. We need to find the pressure inside the bubble.

Since the bubble is spherical, the pressure inside the bubble is equal to the pressure outside the bubble plus the surface tension of the steel divided by the radius of the bubble.

P_inside = P_outside + (2 \* surface tension) / radius

Substituting the given values, we get:

P_inside = 1.5 bar + (2 \* 1.4 N/m) / (0.01 mm \* 10^-3 m/mm)

First, convert the surface tension from N/m to Pa:

1.4 N/m = 1.4 \* 10^3 Pa

Now, substitute the values:

P_inside = 1.5 bar + (2 \* 1.4 \* 10^3 Pa) / (0.01 mm \* 10^-3 m/mm)

Simplify the expression:

P_inside = 1.5 bar + 28 \* 10^3 Pa

2. We are also given the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction Mo(s) + O2(g) ⇔ MoO2(s) at 1873 K: ΔfG°(1873) = -262300 J.
3. We can use the following equation to relate the standard Gibbs free energy change to the equilibrium constant (K):

ΔG° = -RT ln K

where R is the gas constant (8.314 J·K^-1·mol^-1) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (1873 K).

4. We can rearrange the equation to solve for K:

K = exp(-ΔG° / RT)

5. We can use the given values to calculate K for the reaction CO(g) + 0.5O2(g) ⇔ CO2(g):

K = exp(-(-120860 J) / (8.314 J·K^-1·mol^-1 × 1873 K)) ≈ 1.43 × 10^22

6. We can use the given values to calculate K for the reaction Mo(s) + O2(g) ⇔ MoO2(s):

K = exp(-(-262300 J) / (8.314 J·K^-1·mol^-1 × 1873 K)) ≈ 1.23 × 10^44

7. Since the reaction Mo(s) + O2(g) ⇔ MoO2(s) is a side reaction, we can use the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:

K = (p_MoO2)^1 / (p_O2)^1

8. We can use the given value of a_MoO2(s) = 0.5 to calculate the equilibrium pressure of MoO2(s):

p_MoO2 = a_MoO2 × e^(-ΔfG° / RT) ≈ 0.5 × e^(-262300 J / (8.314 J·K^-1·mol^-1 × 1873 K)) ≈ 0.00015 atm

9. We can use the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction CO(g) + 0.5O2(g) ⇔ CO2(g):

K = (p_CO2)^1 / (p_CO)^1 / (p_O2)^0.5

p_CO / p_CO2 = (p_CO2 / p_O2)^0.5 / (p_CO2)^1 ≈ (1.43 × 10^-22 atm)^0.5 / (1.43 × 10^22) ≈ 1.43 × 10^-11

The standard Gibbs energy of formation of PbCl2(liquid) at 873 K is denoted as ΔG°f(PbCl2).

where E is the emf of the cell, E° is the standard emf, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

where a is the activity of each species.

6. The activity of Pb in the Au-Pb alloy is given as 0.72, and the activity of PbCl2 in the electrolyte is given as 0.18.

7. The activity of AuCl2+ is not given, but it can be eliminated by using the fact that the activity of a pure solid is 1. Therefore, aAuCl2+ = 1.

If the sulfur content in the steel is reduced from 0.015 mass% to 0.0025 mass%, the desulfurizing index is? (round off to the nearest integer).;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The molten steel weighs 100 metric tons, which is equivalent to 100,000 kg (since 1 metric ton = 1000 kg).
2. The sulfur content in the steel is reduced from 0.015 mass% to 0.0025 mass%. This means the initial amount of sulfur in the steel is:

0.015 mass% of 100,000 kg = 0.015% x 100,000 kg = 1500 grams (or 1.5 kg)

After desulfurization, the sulfur content is 0.0025 mass%, which is:

0.0025 mass% of 100,000 kg = 0.0025% x 100,000 kg = 250 grams (or 0.25 kg)

The amount of sulfur removed is the difference between the initial and final amounts:

1500 grams - 250 grams = 1250 grams

3. The synthetic slag used for desulfurization weighs 1250 kg. Since the amount of sulfur removed is 1250 grams, we can assume that the entire synthetic slag is consumed in the desulfurization process.

4. The desulfurizing index is defined as the amount of sulfur removed per unit mass of synthetic slag. In this case, the desulfurizing index is:

Assuming regular solution behavior, the activity of Au in the melt is? (round off to 3 decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the following equation for the activity of a component in a regular solution:

ln a_i = (ΔH_i - RT) / RT

where a_i is the activity of component i, ΔH_i is the partial molar enthalpy of component i, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and R is the gas constant.

Given values:

R = 8.314 J.$K^(-1).mol^(-1)$
ΔH_i = -8300 J.mol^(-1)
T = 1400 K

First, we need to convert the partial molar enthalpy from J/mol to J/mol*K:

ΔH_i / R = -8300 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K) = -1000.6 K

Now, we can plug in the values into the equation:

ln a_Au = (-1000.6 K) / (1400 K) = -0.718

a_Au = exp(-0.718) = 0.493

During solidification of a pure metal, the radius(in nm) of critical nucleus at an undercooling of 10 K is? (answer rounded off to 1 decimal place).;"To solve this problem, we can use the classical nucleation theory. The critical nucleus radius (r*) can be calculated using the following equation:

ΔG = -4πr*²γ + ΔH_m / ρ

where:
ΔG = Gibbs free energy change
γ = solid/liquid interface energy
ΔH_m = latent heat of fusion
ρ = density of the metal

Given values:
γ = 0.177 J/m²
ΔH_m = 1.88 × 10^9 J/m³
T_m = 1356 K (melting point)
T = T_m - 10 K = 1346 K (undercooling temperature)

First, we need to calculate the density of the metal at the undercooling temperature. We can use the following equation:

ρ = ρ_m / (1 + α(T_m - T))

where:
ρ_m = density of the metal at the melting point
α = thermal expansion coefficient

Since the thermal expansion coefficient is not given, we can assume it to be approximately 10^-5 K^-1, which is a typical value for most metals. Then:

ρ = ρ_m / (1 + 10^-5 × (1356 - 1346)) ≈ ρ_m

Now, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change:

ΔG = ΔH_m / ρ - 4πr*²γ

Rearranging the equation to solve for r*:

r*² = ΔH_m / (4πγρ) - ΔG / (4πγ)

Substituting the given values:

r*² = (1.88 × 10^9) / (4π × 0.177 × ρ) - ΔG / (4π × 0.177)

To calculate ΔG, we need to know the entropy change (ΔS) during solidification. We can use the following equation:

ΔG = ΔH_m - TΔS

Since the entropy change is not given, we can assume it to be approximately 1.88 × 10^9 J/m³, which is a typical value for most metals. Then:

ΔG = 1.88 × 10^9 - 1346 × 1.88 × 10^9 ≈ -1.34 × 10^9 J/m³

Now, we can calculate r*:

r*² = (1.88 × 10^9) / (4π × 0.177 × ρ) - (-1.34 × 10^9) / (4π × 0.177)
r*² ≈ 1.34 × 10^9 / (4π × 0.177 × ρ)
r*² ≈ 1.34 × 10^9 / (4π × 0.177 × ρ_m)

To find the radius in nanometers, we need to convert the density from kg/m³ to g/cm³:

ρ_m ≈ 5.5 g/cm³ (assuming a typical density for most metals)

Now, we can calculate r*:

r*² ≈ 1.34 × 10^9 / (4π × 0.177 × 5.5)
r* ≈ 2.3 nm

Assuming $𝑎_1$ = $𝑎_2$ = 1, the magnitude of flux at 𝑥 = 2 mm is y * $10^(-3)atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1)$. Find value of y.(answer rounded off to the nearest integer).;"To solve this problem, we need to find the flux of the solute at x = 2 mm. The flux is given by Fick's law of diffusion, which states that the flux is proportional to the negative gradient of the concentration.

The concentration C(x) is given by the expression:

C(x) = a1*x^2 + a2*x

where a1 and a2 are constants. Since a1 = a2 = 1, we can simplify the expression to:

C(x) = x^2 + x

The flux J(x) is given by:

J(x) = -D * ∂C/∂x

where D is the diffusion coefficient, which is given as 3 * 10^(-3) mm^2/s.

To find the flux at x = 2 mm, we need to find the derivative of C(x) with respect to x and then multiply it by the diffusion coefficient.

First, let's find the derivative of C(x) with respect to x:

dC/dx = 2x + 1

Now, substitute x = 2 mm:

dC/dx = 2(2) + 1 = 5

Now, multiply the derivative by the diffusion coefficient:

J(2) = -3 * 10^(-3) * 5 = -1.5 * 10^(-2) atoms/mm^2/s

The magnitude of the flux is the absolute value of the flux:

|J(2)| = 1.5 * 10^(-2) atoms/mm^2/s

Assuming that Dulong-Petit law is valid for a monoatomic solid, the ratio of heat capacities $C_(p)/C_(v)$ at 500K is? (round off to 3 decimals).;"To solve this problem, we can use the following equations:

1. The molar volume (V) is related to the isothermal compressibility (κ) by:

V = RT/π

where π is the pressure.

2. The isobaric expansivity (α) is related to the volume expansion coefficient (β) by:

α = βV

3. The heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) is related to the heat capacity at constant volume ( Cv) by:

Cp = Cv + αVT

where T is the temperature.

Given values:

molar volume (V) = 7*10^(-6) m^3/mol
isothermal compressibility (κ) = 8*10^(-12) Pa^(-1)
isobaric expansivity (α) = 6*10^(-5) K^(-1)
R = 8.314 J/K/mol

First, we can calculate the pressure (π) using the equation:

π = RT/κ

π = (8.314 J/K/mol * 500 K) / (8*10^(-12) Pa^(-1)) = 41.57 MPa

Next, we can calculate the volume expansion coefficient (β) using the equation:

β = α/V

β = (6*10^(-5) K^(-1)) / (7*10^(-6) m^3/mol) = 8.57*10^(-4) K^(-1)

Now, we can calculate the heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) using the Dulong-Petit law:

Cv = (3R) / 2 = (3*8.314 J/K/mol) / 2 = 12.396 J/K/mol

Finally, we can calculate the ratio of heat capacities (Cp/Cv) using the equation:

Cp/Cv = 1 + αVT/Cv

Cp/Cv = 1 + (6*10^(-5) K^(-1) * 500 K * 7*10^(-6) m^3/mol / 12.396 J/K/mol) = 1.0025

The second weld is made at a welding speed of 0.0022 $m.s^(-1)$ with the same arc voltage. If both the welds have identical heat input, the welding current(in amperes) of the second weld is? (round off to the nearest integer).;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The arc heat transfer efficiency is given as 0.65. This means that 65% of the electrical energy is converted into heat energy, and the remaining 35% is lost as radiation, convection, and other forms of energy.
2. The first weld has a welding current of 200 A, an arc voltage of 18 V, and a welding speed of 0.002 m/s. The heat input (HI) can be calculated using the formula:

HI = (I × V) / (η × v)

where I is the welding current, V is the arc voltage, η is the arc heat transfer efficiency, and v is the welding speed.

Plugging in the values, we get:

HI = (200 × 18) / (0.65 × 0.002) = 103,846 J/m

3. Since both welds have identical heat input, the heat input for the second weld is also 103,846 J/m.
4. The second weld has the same arc voltage (18 V) and a welding speed of 0.0022 m/s. We can use the same formula to calculate the welding current for the second weld:

HI = (I × 18) / (0.65 × 0.0022)

Rearranging the formula to solve for I, we get:

I = (HI × 0.65 × 0.0022) / 18

Plugging in the value of HI (103,846 J/m), we get:

I ≈ 235.5 A

Mechanical;95;G-META-22-60;NUM;56;A cylindrical specimen of an Al alloy with diameter of 30 mm is cold extruded to a diameter of 20 mm. If the flow behavior of the alloy is expressed by the equation, 𝜎 = 350 $𝜖^(0.3)$ MPa, the ideal plastic work(in mega joules) of deformation per unit volume is?(answer rounded off to the nearest integer).;"To answer this question, we first need to identify the given equation and what it represents. The equation 𝜎 = 350 $𝜖^(0.3)$ MPa is the flow behavior of the alloy, where 𝜎 is the stress and 𝜖 is the strain. This is a power-law creep equation, commonly used to model the high-temperature flow behavior of alloys.

The ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is the area under the flow curve from the origin to the point of plastic flow. Since the stress-strain curve is not provided, we can't directly calculate the area under the curve. However, we can use the given equation to calculate the strain at which the material starts to flow plastically.

To do this, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the strain at a given stress:

𝜖^(1/0.3) = (𝜎/350)^(1/0.3)

Now, we can set the stress to the yield stress, which is the stress at which the material starts to flow plastically. In this case, the yield stress is not provided, but we can assume it's around 350 MPa, since the flow equation was given in terms of 𝜎. So, substitute 𝜎 = 350 MPa into the equation:

(𝜖^(1/0.3)) = (350/350)^(1/0.3)
𝜖^(1/0.3) = 1
𝜖^(0.3) = 1^(1/0.3)
𝜖^(0.3) = 1
𝜖 = e^(0) = 1

So, the strain at the yield point is 1.

The ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is the area under the curve from the origin to the point of plastic flow. Since the strain at the yield point is 1, the area under the curve is the integral of 𝜎 d𝜖 from 0 to 1:

 Ideal Plastic Work = 𝜎(0 to 1) d𝜖

From the given equation, we can calculate the stress at the strain 1:

𝜎 = 350 $𝜖^(0.3)$
= 350 $1^(0.3)$
= 350

Now, we can calculate the ideal plastic work:

Ideal Plastic Work = ∫350 d𝜖
= 350 ∫1 0
= 350

The answer is in mega joules, so we multiply by 1e-6:

Ideal Plastic Work = 350 × 1e-6

Assume specific heat capacity of air to be constant and equal to 1080 $J.kg^(-1).K^(-1)$ and π = 3.14. Air at 300 K is passed at a mass flow rate of 1.5 $kg.s^(-1)$ through a metallic tube of inner diameter 0.08 m. Inner wall temperature of the tube is maintained at 700 K. Temperature of the air leaving the tube is 600 K. Assuming that heat transfer occurs entirely by steady state convection, length of the tube(in metres) is? (round off to 2 decimal places).;"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the heat transfer rate (Q) using the given coefficient of convective heat transfer (h) and the temperature difference between the tube wall and the air:

Q = hA(T_w - T_a)

where A is the surface area of the tube, T_w is the inner wall temperature, and T_a is the temperature of the air.

2. Calculate the mass flow rate of air (m) and the specific heat capacity of air (c_p):

m = 1.5 kg/s
c_p = 1080 J/kg.K

3. Calculate the temperature change of the air (ΔT) using the given temperatures:

ΔT = T_a_out - T_a_in = 600 K - 300 K = 300 K

4. Calculate the heat transfer rate (Q) using the mass flow rate and temperature change:

Q = mc_pΔT

5. Equate the two expressions for Q and solve for the length of the tube (L):

hA(T_w - T_a) = mc_pΔT

6. Rearrange the equation to solve for L:

L = (mc_pΔT) / (hA(T_w - T_a))

Plugging in the given values, we get:

L = ((1.5 kg/s) * (1080 J/kg.K) * (300 K)) / ((500 W/m^2.K) * (π * (0.08 m)^2) * (700 K - 300 K))

If the overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B and the composition of β is 90 mol% B, the composition(in mol% B) of α is ? (round off to the nearest integer).;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B, which means that the total number of moles of B is 70% of the total number of moles of A and B.
2. The equilibrium microstructure consists of two phases α and β in the molar proportion 2:1, which means that the total number of moles of α is 2/3 of the total number of moles of A and B, and the total number of moles of β is 1/3 of the total number of moles of A and B.
3. The composition of β is 90 mol% B, which means that the number of moles of B in β is 90% of the total number of moles of β.
4. Since the total number of moles of β is 1/3 of the total number of moles of A and B, the number of moles of B in β is 1/3 of the total number of moles of B.
5. The number of moles of B in β is 90% of the total number of moles of B, so the total number of moles of B is 100/90 = 1.11 times the number of moles of B in β.
6. The number of moles of B in β is 1/3 of the total number of moles of B, so the total number of moles of B is 3 times the number of moles of B in β.
7. Therefore, the total number of moles of B is 1.11 times 3 times the number of moles of B in β, which is 3.33 times the number of moles of B in β.
8. The number of moles of B in α is the total number of moles of B minus the number of moles of B in β, which is 3.33 times the number of moles of B in β minus the number of moles of B in β.
9. The number of moles of B in α is 2/3 of the total number of moles of A and B, so the number of moles of B in α is 2/3 of the total number of moles of B.
10. The number of moles of B in α is 3.33 times the number of moles of B in β minus the number of moles of B in β, so the number of moles of B in α is 2/3 of the total number of moles of B minus the number of moles of B in β.

Now, we can calculate the composition of α:

Composition of α = (Number of moles of B in α) / (Total number of moles of A and B)
= (2/3 of the total number of moles of B) / (Total number of moles of A and B)
= (2/3 of 3.33 times the number of moles of B in β) / (Total number of moles of A and B)
= 2.22 times the number of moles of B in β / (Total number of moles of A and B)

Since the overall composition of the alloy is 70 mol% B, the total number of moles of B is 70% of the total number of moles of A and B. Therefore:

Total number of moles of B = 0.7 times the total number of moles of A and B

Substituting this into the expression for the composition of α, we get:

Composition of α = 2.22 times the number of moles of B in β / (0.7 times the total number of moles of A and B)
= 2.22 times the number of moles of B in β / 0.7 times (1/3 of the total number of moles of B)
= 2.22 times the number of moles of B in β / 0.7 times (1/3 of 1.11 times the number of moles of B in β)
= 2.22 times the number of moles of B in β / 0.7 times (1/3 of 1.11)
= 2.22 times the number of moles of B in β / 0.7 times (0.37)
= 2.22 times the number of moles of B in β / 0.253
= 8.77 times the number of moles of B in β

Since the number of moles of B in β is 90% of the total number of moles of B, the number of moles of B in β is 0.9 times the total number of moles of B. Therefore:

Material Applications;2;G-XEC-2012-14;MCQS-NUM;38;Determine the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in a copolymer of vinyl chloride ($CH_2CHCl$) and vinyl acetate ($CH_2-CH-OCOCH_3$) having molecular weight of 10520 g/mol and degree of polymerization of 160.  (A) 0.14 (B) 0.30 (C) 0.70 (D) 0.86;"To determine the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of formula units in the polymer:
The molecular weight of the copolymer is given as 10520 g/mol, and the degree of polymerization is 160. To calculate the total number of formula units, we can use the formula:

Total number of formula units = Molecular weight / Molecular weight of one formula unit

In this case, the molecular weight of one formula unit is the average molecular weight of the copolymer, which is the sum of the molecular weights of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate.

Molecular weight of vinyl chloride = 62.5 g/mol (C2H3Cl)
Molecular weight of vinyl acetate = 86 g/mol (C4H6O2)

Average molecular weight of the copolymer = (62.5 + 86)/2 = 74.25 g/mol

Now, we can calculate the total number of formula units:

Total number of formula units = 10520 g/mol / 74.25 g/mol = 141.4 formula units

2. Calculate the number of formula units of vinyl chloride:
Since the molecular weight of vinyl chloride is 62.5 g/mol, the number of formula units of vinyl chloride can be calculated by dividing the total number of formula units by the molecular weight of vinyl chloride:

Number of formula units of vinyl chloride = 141.4 formula units / 62.5 g/mol = 2.26 formula units

3. Calculate the mole fraction of vinyl chloride:
The mole fraction (x) is defined as the number of moles of vinyl chloride divided by the total number of moles in the copolymer. Since the number of formula units of vinyl chloride is 2.26, we can calculate the number of moles of vinyl chloride:

Number of moles of vinyl chloride = 2.26 formula units / 62.5 g/mol = 0.036 moles

The total number of moles in the copolymer is the number of formula units divided by the average molecular weight of the copolymer:

Total number of moles = 141.4 formula units / 74.25 g/mol = 1.91 moles

Now, we can calculate the mole fraction of vinyl chloride:

Mole fraction (x) = Number of moles of vinyl chloride / Total number of moles
= 0.036 moles / 1.91 moles
= 0.19

After rounding to two decimal places, the mole fraction of vinyl chloride is approximately 0.19.

So, the correct answer is:

(B) 0.30

σ = n \* e \* μ

where e is the charge of an electron (1.6 x 10^-19 C) and μ is the mobility of the charge carriers.

Given the drift velocity (v) and the electric field (E), we can calculate the mobility (μ) using the formula:

μ = v / E

Substituting the given values, we get:

μ = 100 m/s / 500 V/m = 0.2 m^2/Vs

Now, we can calculate the conductivity (σ) using the formula:

σ = n \* e \* μ

Msat = (2 * μ0 * M_s * N) / (a^3)

where:
μ0 is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 T·m/A)
M_s is the saturation magnetization per unit volume (A/m)
N is the number of atoms per unit volume (m^-3)
a is the lattice parameter (m)

Given the lattice parameter for bcc iron as 2.866 Å, we can convert it to meters:

a = 2.866 Å = 2.866 × 10^-10 m

The number of atoms per unit volume (N) for bcc iron can be calculated using the following formula:

N = (a^3 / (4 * V_0))

where V_0 is the atomic volume (m^3). The atomic volume for iron is approximately 11.1 × 10^-6 m^3.

N = (2.866 × 10^-10 m)^3 / (4 * 11.1 × 10^-6 m^3) = 1.63 × 10^28 m^-3

The saturation magnetization per unit volume (M_s) for iron is approximately 1.7 × 10^6 A/m.

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:

Msat = (2 * 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A * 1.7 × 10^6 A/m * 1.63 × 10^28 m^-3) / (2.866 × 10^-10 m)^3

Msat ≈ 1.53 × 10^6 A/m

(A) 44.9% (B) 66.1% (C) 55.1% (D) 34.9%;"To solve this problem, we need to find the volume percentage of proeutectoid α just below 723°C.

The reaction is:

γ (0.8 wt.% C) → α (0.02 wt.% C) + Fe3C (6.67 wt.% C)

The γ phase is the austenite phase, which contains 0.8 wt.% C. The α phase is the ferrite phase, which contains 0.02 wt.% C. The Fe3C phase is the cementite phase, which contains 6.67 wt.% C.

The initial composition of the steel is 0.45 wt.% C. Since the γ phase contains 0.8 wt.% C, the amount of γ phase that reacts to form α and Fe3C is:

0.8 wt.% C - 0.02 wt.% C = 0.78 wt.% C

This means that 0.78 wt.% C is converted from γ to α and Fe3C.

The volume percentage of proeutectoid α can be calculated as:

Volume % of α = (0.78 wt.% C / 0.45 wt.% C) × 100% ≈ 66.1%

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Phase transition;15;G-XEC-2012-18;MCQS-NUM;63;A plain 0.45 wt.% carbon steel is cooled slowly from 900°C to just below the eutectoid temperature (723°C) so that the following reaction occurs: γ (0.8 wt.% C) ↔ α (0.02 wt.% C) + $Fe_3C$ (6.67 wt.% C). Find the volume % of pearlite for the steel just below 723°C for 0.45 wt.% carbon steel.  (A) 44.9% (B) 55.1% (C) 40.9% (D) 59.1%;"To solve this problem, we need to find the volume percentage of pearlite in the steel just below 723°C.

The given reaction shows that the γ (0.8 wt.% C) phase transforms to α (0.02 wt.% C) + $Fe_3C$ (6.67 wt.% C) as the steel is cooled. This means that the 0.8 wt.% C in the original γ phase will transform into a mixture of 0.02 wt.% C (α phase) and 6.67 wt.% C ($Fe_3C$ phase).

The total carbon content in the original γ phase is 0.8 wt.%, which will be distributed between the α phase and the $Fe_3C$ phase.

The α phase has a carbon content of 0.02 wt.%, which means that the remaining carbon will be present in the $Fe_3C$ phase. The original 0.8 wt.% C in the γ phase is the sum of the 0.02 wt.% C in the α phase and the C in $Fe_3C$ phase.

Since the original steel has a carbon content of 0.45 wt.%, we can find the volume percentage of pearlite (α + $Fe_3C$ phase) by subtracting the α phase carbon content from the original carbon content and dividing by the original carbon content.

Volume % of pearlite = [(0.8 - 0.02) / 0.8] * 100 = 72.5%

To find the volume percentage of $Fe_3C$ phase, we can subtract the volume percentage of pearlite from 100:

Volume % of $Fe_3C$ = 100 - 72.5 = 27.5%

However, the question asks for the volume % of pearlite for the steel just below 723°C. Since the problem states that the reaction occurs, we can assume that the steel is entirely composed of pearlite (α + $Fe_3C$) after the reaction.

The correct answer is:

The Young’s modulus of steel ($E_(steel)$) is 200 GPa, and of aluminium ($E_(Al)$) is 70 GPa. The Poisson’s ratio (ν) can be taken as 0.3. When the same load is applied to an aluminium bar, it is found to give same elastic strain as the steel. Calculate the cross-sectional area of the aluminium bar.  (A) 11.43 $cm^2$ (B) 14.93 $cm^2$ (C) 18.26 $cm^2$ (D) 22.86 $cm^2$;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The steel bar is subjected to a 20 kN tensile load, which causes an elastic strain. The elastic strain (ε) can be calculated using Hooke's law:

ε = σ / E

where σ is the stress and E is the Young's modulus. Since the load is axial, the stress is given by:

σ = F / A

where F is the force (20 kN) and A is the cross-sectional area (8 cm^2).

ε = (20,000 N / 8,000 mm^2) / 200,000,000,000 Pa = 1 × 10^-5

2. The same load is applied to the aluminium bar, which causes the same elastic strain (ε). The stress in the aluminium bar can be calculated using the same formula:

σ = F / A_al

where A_al is the cross-sectional area of the aluminium bar.

Since the elastic strain is the same, the stress in the aluminium bar is also 1 × 10^-5.

3. The stress in the aluminium bar can be related to its Young's modulus (E_al) using Hooke's law:

σ = E_al × ε

Substituting the values, we get:

1 × 10^-5 = E_al × 1 × 10^-5

E_al = 70,000,000,000 Pa (given)

4. The stress in the aluminium bar can be rearranged to solve for the cross-sectional area:

A_al = F / σ

Substituting the values, we get:

A_al = 20,000 N / (1 × 10^-5 × 70,000,000,000 Pa)

A_al = 28.57 cm^2

Given that the atomic diameter of chromium is 2.494 Å, we can plug this value into the formula:

a = 2.494 Å √3/2

2dsin(θ) = nλ

where:

* d is the interplanar spacing (also known as the lattice parameter)
* θ is the diffraction angle (2θ in this case)
* n is an integer (1, 2, 3, etc.)
* λ is the wavelength of the radiation (1.54 Å in this case)

We are given the atomic diameter of chromium (2.494 Å), which is twice the lattice parameter (d) since it's a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. Therefore, the lattice parameter is:

d = 2.494 Å / 2 = 1.247 Å

Now we can plug in the values into Bragg's Law:

2(1.247 Å)sin(θ) = n(1.54 Å)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2.494 sin(θ) = 3.08

Atomic structure;31;G-XEC-2013-13;NUM;35;X-rays of unknown wavelength are diffracted by an FCC metal with a lattice parameter of 0.352nm. The measured ‘2θ’ angle for the {200} peak is 61.08°. Calculate the wavelength of the Xray used, in nm.;"To solve this problem, we can use the Bragg's Law equation, which relates the wavelength of the X-ray, the lattice parameter of the metal, and the angle of diffraction.

The Bragg's Law equation is:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

where:
n = integer (order of diffraction)
λ = wavelength of the X-ray
d = lattice parameter of the metal
θ = angle of diffraction

In this problem, we are given the lattice parameter (d) and the angle of diffraction (θ) for the {200} peak. We need to find the wavelength (λ) of the X-ray.

First, we need to find the value of d for the {200} peak. Since the metal has an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) structure, the lattice parameter for the {200} peak is:

d = a/√2

where a is the lattice parameter of the metal.

Given the lattice parameter of the metal (a) is 0.352 nm, we can calculate the value of d for the {200} peak:

d = 0.352 nm / √2
= 0.248 nm

Now, we can use the Bragg's Law equation to find the wavelength (λ) of the X-ray:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

We are given the angle of diffraction (θ) as 61.08°, so we can convert it to radians:

θ = 61.08° × (π/180)
= 1.061 rad

Now, we can plug in the values:

nλ = 2 × 0.248 nm × sin(1.061 rad)
= 0.248 nm × 0.951
= 0.236 nm

Since n is an integer, we can divide the result by n to get the wavelength:

λ = 0.236 nm / 1
= 0.236 nm

Therefore, the wavelength of the X-ray used is 0.236 nm.

V = (a^2 * sqrt(3)) / 2 + c^2

where a is the length of the side of the hexagon and c is the height of the unit cell.

Given values:
a = 0.30 nm
c = 0.56 nm

Plugging in the values, we get:

V = ((0.30 nm)^2 * sqrt(3)) / 2 + (0.56 nm)^2
= (0.09 nm^2 * 1.732) / 2 + 0.3136 nm^2
= 0.1554 nm^2 + 0.3136 nm^2

Thermodynamics;4;G-XEC-2013-15;NUM;29;The band gap of a semiconducting material used to make an LED is 1.43 eV. What will be the minimum wavelength ofthe radiation emitted by this LED, in μm?;"To solve this question, we can use the relationship between the energy of a photon and its wavelength. Specifically, the energy of a photon (E) is inversely proportional to its wavelength (λ):

E = hc/λ

where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light.

Given that the band gap energy is 1.43 eV, we can set E equal to 1.43 eV:

1.43 eV = hc/λ

We can rearrange this equation to solve for λ:

λ = hc/E

To convert the energy from eV to Joules, we can multiply by the conversion factor:

1.43 eV × (1 J / 1.602 × 10^(-19) eV) = 9.03 × 10^(-19) J

Now we can plug in the values:

λ = (6.626 × 10^(-34) J s) × (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (9.03 × 10^(-19) J) = 0.872 μm

So, the minimum wavelength of radiation emitted by this LED is approximately 0.872 μm.

(C) Screw dislocations can change the slip plane without climb (D) Burger’s vector of an edge dislocation is parallel to the dislocation line.;"Based on the context, I'll provide an answer.

Dislocations are defects in a crystal lattice where a row of atoms is missing or extra. Here's a brief explanation of each option:

(A) Dislocations are indeed thermodynamically unstable defects, as they create an energy imbalance in the crystal lattice.

(B) Dislocations can move inside a crystal under the action of an applied stress, which is known as dislocation motion or dislocation glide.

(C) Screw dislocations can change the slip plane without climb. In a screw dislocation, the dislocation line is parallel to the Burgers vector, and the dislocation can move by gliding along the slip plane. However, if the dislocation needs to change the slip plane, it would require climb, which is the movement of the dislocation line perpendicular to the slip plane.

(D) The Burgers vector of an edge dislocation is perpendicular to the dislocation line, not parallel.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

(D) Burger’s vector of an edge dislocation is parallel to the dislocation line.

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What is the relaxation time constant for this material?;"I'm happy to help! However, I notice that there is no context provided, which makes it challenging to solve the problem. The concept of relaxation time constant is typically used in the context of viscoelastic materials, which exhibit both elastic and viscous behavior.

Assuming that the context is related to viscoelastic behavior, I can provide a general approach to solve the problem. The relaxation time constant (τ) is related to the stress relaxation of a material. It can be calculated using the following formula:

τ = (σ1 - σ2) / (ε1 - ε2)

where σ1 and σ2 are the initial and final stresses, respectively, and ε1 and ε2 are the corresponding strains.

Given the problem statement, we know that the initial stress (σ1) is 10 MPa, the final stress (σ2) is 5 MPa, and the strain (ε) is held constant at 50%. We can plug in these values into the formula:

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa. What will be the stress after 60 days at 20°C?;"Since the strain is held constant at 50%, the elastomer is in a state of constant strain. This means that the stress-strain curve is horizontal at this point.

Initially, the stress is 10 MPa, and the strain is 50%. As the stress decreases to 5 MPa after 40 days, the strain remains constant at 50%.

Since the stress-strain curve is horizontal at this point, the stress will remain constant at 5 MPa. Therefore, the stress after 60 days at 20°C will still be 5 MPa.

The question asks which metal is commonly alloyed with iron to improve its corrosion resistance.

Recrystallization is a process where a cold-worked metal is heated to a temperature above its recrystallization temperature, allowing the metal to relieve internal stresses and form new, larger crystals. This process can affect the metal's mechanical properties.

When a metal is cold-worked, it becomes stronger due to the introduction of defects and dislocations, but its ductility decreases. Upon recrystallization, the metal's strength can actually decrease as the defects and dislocations are relieved, and the metal becomes more ductile as the new crystals form.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A)transverse (B)longitudinal (C)random (D)both transverse and longitudinal;"Based on the context, we can analyze the question and provide an answer.

In carbon fiber reinforced resin composites, the Young's modulus depends on the orientation of the fibers with respect to the applied load. When the fibers are aligned in the direction of the applied load, they can effectively resist the load and contribute to the overall stiffness of the composite. This is known as the longitudinal orientation.

On the other hand, when the fibers are perpendicular to the applied load, they do not contribute as much to the overall stiffness, as they are not aligned to resist the load. This is known as the transverse orientation.

Therefore, for a given fiber volume content, the maximum value of Young's modulus will be achieved when the fibers are oriented in the longitudinal direction, i.e., parallel to the applied load.

Molecular weight = Degree of polymerization x Molar mass of the repeating unit

where Molar mass of the repeating unit is the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms in the repeating unit.

Since polybutadiene is a polymer of butadiene (C4H6), the repeating unit is C4H6. The molar mass of C4H6 is:

Molar mass of C4H6 = 4 x 12.01 g/mol (carbon) + 6 x 1.01 g/mol (hydrogen) = 56.08 g/mol

Now, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the degree of polymerization:

Degree of polymerization = Molecular weight / Molar mass of the repeating unit

It is noticed that the alloy does not exhibit any strain hardening and fails at a total strain of 0.108. The mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material in MJ/$m^3$ is;"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area under the stress-strain curve up to the point of failure.

The stress-strain curve for the material is a straight line, since it does not exhibit any strain hardening. The slope of the line is given by the Young's modulus, which is 110 GPa.

The yield strength is 880 MPa, which is the stress at which the material starts to deform plastically. The total strain at failure is 0.108.

We can calculate the area under the stress-strain curve as follows:

1. Calculate the stress at failure:

Stress at failure = Yield strength + (Total strain at failure - Total strain at yield) \* Young's modulus
= 880 MPa + (0.108 - 0) \* 110 GPa
= 880 MPa + 11.88 GPa
= 891.88 GPa

2. Calculate the area under the stress-strain curve:

Area = (1/2) \* Stress at failure \* Total strain at failure
= (1/2) \* 891.88 GPa \* 0.108
= 48.33 GPa

3. Convert the area from GPa to MJ/m^3:

1 GPa = 1,000,000,000 Pa
1 Pa = 1 J/m^3
So, 1 GPa = 1,000,000,000 J/m^3

Area in MJ/m^3 = 48.33 GPa \* 1,000,000,000 J/m^3/GPa
= 48,330,000,000 J/m^3

If 100 g of water that is at 90 °C is added to the cup, the final temperature of water in °C is;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the copper cup contains 80 g of water at 4 °C.
2. The specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g °C, so the heat energy required to raise the temperature of 80 g of water from 4 °C to some higher temperature T is:

Q = mcΔT = 80 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (T - 4 °C)

3. Since the water is at 4 °C, it has a certain amount of heat energy associated with it. Let's call this heat energy Q1. When the 100 g of water at 90 °C is added, the heat energy of the system increases by Q1.
4. The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/g °C, so the heat energy required to raise the temperature of the copper cup from 4 °C to some higher temperature T is:

Q2 = mcΔT = (140 g - 80 g) × 0.385 J/g °C × (T - 4 °C) = 12 g × 0.385 J/g °C × (T - 4 °C)

5. Since the copper cup is initially at 4 °C, it has a certain amount of heat energy associated with it. Let's call this heat energy Q2. When the 100 g of water at 90 °C is added, the heat energy of the system increases by Q2.
6. The total heat energy of the system after adding the 100 g of water is the sum of Q1, Q2, and the heat energy associated with the 100 g of water:

Q_total = Q1 + Q2 + 100 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (90 °C - T)

7. Since the system is in thermal equilibrium, the final temperature T is the same for all components. Therefore, the heat energy associated with the 100 g of water is also Q_total.

8. We can now set up an equation based on the heat energy balance:

Q1 + Q2 + 100 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (90 °C - T) = Q1

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 g × 0.385 J/g °C × (T - 4 °C) = 100 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (90 °C - T)

We are given the Young's modulus of the composite (E_c) and the Young's moduli of the Ti matrix (E_Ti) and the SiC fibers (E_SiC).

We can write the following equation using the rule of mixtures:

E_c = V_f \* E_SiC + V_m \* E_Ti

where V_f is the volume fraction of fibers and V_m is the volume fraction of matrix.

We are given E_c = 185 GPa, E_SiC = 360 GPa, and E_Ti = 110 GPa. We need to find V_f.

Rearranging the equation to solve for V_f, we get:

V_f = (E_c - V_m \* E_Ti) / E_SiC

We can simplify this equation by substituting the given values:

V_f = (185 - V_m \* 110) / 360

Now, we need to find V_m. We know that V_f + V_m = 1 (since the total volume is equal to the sum of the volumes of the fibers and matrix).

Substituting V_f = (185 - V_m \* 110) / 360 into the equation V_f + V_m = 1, we get:

((185 - V_m \* 110) / 360) + V_m = 1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

V_m = 0.5

Now that we have found V_m, we can find V_f:

V_f = (185 - 0.5 \* 110) / 360

E = hf

where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the photon.

We are given that the electron falls from the n = 4 state to the n = 2 state, which means that the energy of the photon is equal to the energy difference between these two states. The energy of a state in a hydrogen atom is given by:

E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2

So, the energy difference between the n = 4 state and the n = 2 state is:

E = E_4 - E_2 = -13.6 eV / 4^2 - (-13.6 eV / 2^2) = 3.4 eV

Now, we can use the formula for the energy of a photon to find the frequency of the photon:

f = E / h

f = 3.4 eV / (4.136 x 10^-15 eV s) = 8.25 x 10^14 Hz

We are given that the molecular weight of gallium (Ga) is 69.72 g/mol and the molecular weight of arsenic (As) is 74.92 g/mol. We want to find the weight in kg of gallium (Ga) to be mixed with arsenic (As) for obtaining 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs).

First, we need to find the molecular weight of gallium arsenide (GaAs). Since GaAs is a compound made up of Ga and As, we can calculate its molecular weight by adding the atomic weights of Ga and As:

M(GaAs) = M(Ga) + M(As)
= 69.72 g/mol + 74.92 g/mol
= 144.64 g/mol

Now, we know that the molecular weight of GaAs is 144.64 g/mol. We want to find the weight in kg of Ga to be mixed with As for obtaining 1.0 kg of GaAs. Since 1 kg is equal to 1000 g, we can set up the following equation:

Weight of Ga (in g) + Weight of As (in g) = 1000 g (since 1.0 kg = 1000 g)

We know that the molecular weight of GaAs is 144.64 g/mol, and we want to find the weight of Ga in grams. Let's assume the weight of Ga is x grams. Then, the weight of As would be:

Weight of As (in g) = 1000 g - x g

Now, we can set up the equation:

x g + (1000 g - x g) = 1000 g

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x g + 1000 g - x g = 1000 g

Combine like terms:

1000 g = 1000 g

This equation is true, but it doesn't give us the value of x. To find the value of x, we need to use the fact that the molecular weight of GaAs is 144.64 g/mol. Since GaAs is a compound made up of Ga and As, the weight of Ga in grams is equal to the weight of GaAs in grams divided by the molecular weight of GaAs:

Weight of Ga (in g) = Weight of GaAs (in g) / M(GaAs)
= 1000 g / 144.64 g/mol
= 6.89 g

So, the weight in kg of gallium (Ga) to be mixed with arsenic (As) for obtaining 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs) is:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

where:
n = order of reflection (1st order reflection in this case)
λ = wavelength of radiation (0.1542 nm)
d = distance between planes (lattice parameter / √h^2 + k^2 + l^2)
θ = diffraction angle (in radians)

First, we need to find the distance between planes (d). For a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, the lattice parameter (a) is related to the distance between planes by:

d = a / √h^2 + k^2 + l^2

Given the lattice parameter (a) = 0.392 nm, we can find the distance between planes (d) for the (113) set of planes:

d = 0.392 nm / √1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2
= 0.392 nm / √14
= 0.0965 nm

Now, we can plug in the values into Bragg's law equation:

1 × 0.1542 nm = 2 × 0.0965 nm × sin(θ)

To solve for θ, we can rearrange the equation:

sin(θ) = (0.1542 nm) / (2 × 0.0965 nm)
= 0.8003

θ = arcsin(0.8003)
= 53.13°

The activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al in kJ/mol is;"To solve this problem, we can use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the diffusion coefficient (D) to the temperature (T) and the activation energy (Q) as follows:

D = D0 \* exp(-Q/RT)

where D0 is a constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given the diffusion coefficients at two different temperatures, so we can rearrange the equation to solve for Q:

Q = -RT \* ln(D/D0)

First, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:

500 °C = 773 K
550 °C = 823 K

Next, we can plug in the values for D and T into the equation:

773 K: Q = -8.314 J/mol\*K \* ln(1.9 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s / D0)
823 K: Q = -8.314 J/mol\*K \* ln(5.8 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s / D0)

Since Q is the same at both temperatures, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

-8.314 J/mol\*K \* ln(1.9 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s / D0) = -8.314 J/mol\*K \* ln(5.8 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s / D0)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

ln(1.9 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s / D0) = ln(5.8 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s / D0)

Dividing both sides by ln(10^(-13) m^2/s / D0), we get:

ln(1.9 / 5.8) = 0

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

1.9 / 5.8 = e^0

Simplifying, we get:

1.9 / 5.8 = 1

Now, we can solve for D0:

D0 = 1.9 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s

Finally, we can plug in the value of D0 into one of the original equations to solve for Q:

Q = -8.314 J/mol\*K \* ln(1.9 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s / (1.9 \* 10^(-13) m^2/s)) = 63.4 kJ/mol

Calculate the original length of the iron rail track in cm. (linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The length of the iron rail track increases by 0.05 cm when the temperature increases from 15°C to 45°C.
2. The linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 × 10^(-6) K^(-1). This means that for every 1°C increase in temperature, the length of the iron rail track increases by 11.0 × 10^(-6) cm.
3. To find the increase in length due to the temperature change from 15°C to 45°C, we need to calculate the difference in temperature: ΔT = 45°C - 15°C = 30°C.
4. Now, we can calculate the increase in length due to the temperature change: ΔL = ΔT × linear thermal expansion coefficient × original length
= 30°C × 11.0 × 10^(-6) K^(-1) × original length
= 0.033 cm (approximately)
5. Since the actual increase in length is given as 0.05 cm, we can set up an equation: 0.033 cm = 0.05 cm

The absorption coefficient (α) of germanium at 1.3 µm is 3.3 * $10^5$ $m^(-1)$.;"To solve this problem, we'll use the Beer-Lambert law, which describes the absorption of radiation by a material. The law states that the absorbed fraction of radiation (I) is given by:

I = 1 - exp(-αx)

where α is the absorption coefficient, x is the thickness of the material, and exp is the exponential function.

We want to find the thickness of the germanium crystal layer (x) that would absorb 80% of the incident radiation. Let's set up the equation:

I = 0.8

Substitute the values given in the problem:

1 - exp(-αx) = 0.8

To solve for x, we need to calculate the exponential function. Using the exponential function calculator or the properties of exponentials, we can rewrite the equation as:

exp(-αx) = 0.2

Now, take the logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.2) = -αx

Recall that the natural logarithm (ln) and the logarithm to the base e are related by ln(x) = loge(x).

Substitute the value of α and simplify:

ln(0.2) = -(3.3 * 10^5 m^-1) * x
ln(0.2) = -3.3 * 10^5 * 10^-3 * x (converting m^-1 to µm^-1)
ln(0.2) = -33 * 10^2 * x

Now, solve for x:

-x = ln(0.2) / (-33 * 10^2)
x = ln(0.2) / 33 * 10^2
x ≈ 1.02 * 10^-2 µm

So, the thickness of the germanium crystal layer required to absorb 80% of the incident radiation is approximately 10.2 micrometers.

Mg → Mg2+ + 2e-

The number of moles of Mg reacted is given by:

n = mass of Mg reacted / molar mass of Mg

n = 1 kg / 24.31 g/mol = 0.041 mol

The charge passed through the electrolyte is given by:

Q = It

where I is the current and t is the time.

The number of moles of electrons transferred is equal to the number of moles of Mg reacted:

n = Q / (2 × F)

where F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol).

Rearranging the equation to solve for I, we get:

I = 2nFt

Substituting the values, we get:

I = 2 × 0.041 mol × 96,485 C/mol × 60 days × 24 hours/day × 3600 seconds/hour

I = 1.43 A

C = εA/d

where C is the capacitance, ε is the dielectric constant, A is the electrode area, and d is the thickness of the dielectric.

Given values:

ε = 2000 (dielectric constant)
A = 0.2 cm^2 (electrode area)
d = 0.075 cm (thickness of dielectric)

First, we need to convert the thickness from centimeters to meters:

d = 0.075 cm = 0.075 x 10^-2 m = 7.5 x 10^-3 m

Now we can plug in the values:

C = εA/d
= 2000 x 0.2 x 10^-4 m
= 4 x 10^-7 F

1. Calculate the theoretical density of the composite using the rule of mixtures:

Theoretical density of the composite = (Volume fraction of SiC) \* (Theoretical density of SiC) + (Volume fraction of $Al_2O_3$) \* (Theoretical density of $Al_2O_3$)

= (0.3) \* (3.22 g/cm^3) + (0.7) \* (3.95 g/cm^3)
= 1.5869 g/cm^3

2. Calculate the apparent density of the composite (i.e., the measured bulk density):

Apparent density of the composite = 3.65 g/cm^3

3. Calculate the porosity (%):

Porosity (%) = (1 - (Apparent density of the composite) / (Theoretical density of the composite)) \* 100

= (1 - (3.65 g/cm^3) / (1.5869 g/cm^3)) \* 100

The (100) plane in an fcc crystal has a square lattice with a side length of 2R, where R is the atomic radius. The area of the plane is therefore:

A = (2R)^2 = 4R^2

The number of atoms per unit area can be found by considering the arrangement of atoms in the plane. In an fcc crystal, each atom is surrounded by 12 nearest neighbors, and the (100) plane is a plane of atoms. Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area is:

n = 1/(2R)^2 = 1/4R^2

The planar density is the number of atoms per unit area, so:

Find the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is $10^(-16)$ $m^2s^(-1)$;"Let's use the given information to solve the problem.

The diffusion coefficient is related to temperature according to the Arrhenius equation:

D(T) = D0 \* exp(-Ea / kT)

where D0 is a constant, Ea is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

We are given the values of D for T = 400K and T = 500K:

D(400K) = 1.28 x 10^(-22) m^2s^(-1)
D(500K) = 5.75 x 10^(-19) m^2s^(-1)

We can rearrange the Arrhenius equation to solve for temperature:

ln(D(T)) = ln(D0) - (Ea / kT)

We can use the two given values of D to solve for ln(D0) and Ea/k:

ln(D0) = ln(D(400K)) + (Ea / kT)
ln(D0) = ln(1.28 x 10^(-22)) + (Ea / (8.62 x 10^(-5) K^-1 x 400K)) ≈ -42.51
Ea / k ≈ 1.38 x 10^4 K

Now we can use the first equation to find the value of D(T) corresponding to the desired value of D(T) = 10^(-16) m^2s^(-1):

ln(D(T)) = -42.51 + (1.38 x 10^4 K / T)

Solving for T:

ln(10^(-16)) = -42.51 + (1.38 x 10^4 K / T)

Copper has an atomic weight of 63.54 amu;"To calculate the density of copper, we need to know the number of atoms per unit volume and then multiply it with the mass of one atom.

First, we need to find the number of atoms per unit volume. The formula for the number of atoms per unit volume for an fcc lattice is:

n = 1 / (a^3 * √4π)

where 'n' is the number of atoms per unit volume and 'a' is the lattice parameter.

n = 1 / (0.365^3 * √4π) = 1.77 x 10^28 atoms/m^3

Next, we need to find the mass of one atom. The formula for the mass of one atom is:

m = Atomic mass/Avogadro's number

where 'm' is the mass of one atom and 'Atomic mass' is the atomic weight of copper.

m = 63.54/6.022 x 10^26 = 1.05 x 10^-26 kg

Now, we can find the mass per unit volume by multiplying the number of atoms per unit volume with the mass of one atom.

ρ = n * m
= 1.77 x 10^28 atoms/m^3 * 1.05 x 10^-26 kg/atom
= 8.85 g/cm^3

Since we want the answer in kg/m^3, we need to convert the density from g/cm^3 to kg/m^3.

1 g/cm^3 = (1000 g)/(1000 cm)^3 = 1000 kg/m^3

So, the density of copper in kg/m^3 is:

The energy of the x-ray is 1.54 keV, which is equivalent to 1.54 x 10^3 eV. The band gap of silicon is 1.1 eV, which means that the energy required to generate an electron-hole pair is 1.1 eV.

The number of photons that can be generated by the x-ray is given by the energy of the x-ray divided by the energy of each photon:

Number of photons = Energy of x-ray / Energy of each photon
= 1.54 x 10^3 eV / 1.1 eV

When the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm, the expected yield strength(MPa) is ?;"Based on the Hall-Petch relationship, which describes the relationship between grain size and yield strength, we can write:

Yield strength ∝ 1/√grain size

Rearranging this equation to solve for yield strength, we get:

Yield strength ∝ √(1/grain size)

Since the yield strength increases from 120 MPa to 150 MPa when the grain size decreases from 256 μm to 64 μm, we can calculate the slope of the line:

Slope = (150 - 120) MPa / (64 - 256) μm ≈ 0.75 MPa/μm

Now, we can use this slope to calculate the expected yield strength when the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm:

Yield strength ≈ 150 MPa + (0.75 MPa/μm) × (256 - 16) μm ≈ 210 MPa

A direct bandgap semiconductor has a bandgap of 1.8 eV. The threshold value of the wavelength(in Å) BELOW which this material will absorb radiation is;"To solve this problem, we can use Planck's equation:

E = hc / λ

where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the photon.

Since the bandgap energy is given as 1.8 eV, we can convert this to joules:

1.8 eV = (1.8 * 1.6 * 10^(-19) C) * 1.6 * 10^(-19) J/C = 2.88 * 10^(-19) J

where $C$ is the concentration of gallium, $t$ is time, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $x$ is the distance from the surface.

3. We are given that the concentration at a depth of $10^{-3}$ cm is $C_0/2$, so we can write:

$$C_0/2 = C_0 - \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} \cdot 10^{-3}$$

where $\frac{\partial C}{\partial x}$ is the concentration gradient at the surface.

4. We can simplify the above equation to get:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial x} = \frac{C_0}{10^{-3}} = 10^3 C_0$$

5. Now, we can use the diffusion equation to relate the concentration gradient to the time:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} = D \cdot 10^3 C_0$$

6. We are given that the concentration at the surface is $C_0$, so we can write:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \cdot 10^3 C_0 = D \cdot 10^3 \cdot \frac{C_0}{2}$$

7. Now, we can use the fact that $\text{erf}(0.5) \approx 0.5$ to relate the concentration at the surface to the time:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \cdot 10^3 \cdot \frac{C_0}{2} = \frac{C_0}{\sqrt{\pi t}}$$

8. Equating the two expressions for $\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}$, we get:

$$D \cdot 10^3 \cdot \frac{C_0}{2} = \frac{C_0}{\sqrt{\pi t}}$$

9. Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t = \frac{\pi (10^3)^2 (2D)^2}{4C_0^2}$$

10. Substituting the given values, we get:

$$t = \frac{\pi (10^3)^2 (2 \cdot 6 \times 10^{-11})^2}{4C_0^2} = \frac{\pi (10^6) (7.2 \times 10^{-20})}{4C_0^2}$$

11. Since we don't know the value of $C_0$, we can't give a specific answer. However, we can express the answer in terms of $C_0$:

$$t = \frac{\pi (10^6) (7.2 \times 10^{-20})}{4C_0^2}$$

Thermodynamics;32;G-XEC-2016-17;NUM;34;A batch of spherical titania nanoparticles, uniform in size, has a specific surface area of 125 $m^2$ $^(g−1)$. If the density of titania is 4.23 g $cm^(−3)$, the diameter(in nm) of the particles is;"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the surface area of a sphere:

Surface area = 4πr^2

where r is the radius of the sphere.

We are given that the specific surface area is 125 m^2/g, which means that the surface area of 1 gram of the nanoparticles is 125 m^2.

We can set up an equation using the formula above:

4πr^2 = 125 m^2

To solve for r, we can divide both sides by 4π:

r^2 = 125 m^2 / (4π)

r^2 = 9.93 × 10^-3 m^2

r = √(9.93 × 10^-3 m^2) = 0.0993 m

The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so:

Diameter = 2r = 2 × 0.0993 m = 0.1986 m

To convert this to nanometers, we can multiply by 10^9 (since 1 m = 10^9 nm):

Diameter = 0.1986 m × 10^9 nm/m = 1986000 nm

However, the problem asks for the diameter in nm, so we can round this answer to:

In the vulcanization of 50 g of natural rubber, 10 g of sulfur is added. Assuming the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The molecular weight of a mer of natural rubber is 68 amu.
2. The atomic weight of S is 32 amu.
3. The mer to S ratio is 1:1, which means that for every mer of natural rubber, there is one sulfur atom.
4. The total weight of natural rubber is 50 g.
5. The weight of sulfur added is 10 g.

To find the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected, we need to find the maximum number of sulfur atoms that can be incorporated into the natural rubber.

1. Convert the weight of natural rubber from grams to moles: 50 g / 68 amu = 0.735 mol (approximately)
2. Convert the weight of sulfur from grams to moles: 10 g / 32 amu = 0.3125 mol (approximately)
3. Since the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the number of sulfur atoms is equal to the number of mers of natural rubber. Therefore, the maximum number of cross-linked sites that could be connected is equal to the number of sulfur atoms, which is 0.3125 mol.
4. Convert the number of moles to a percentage: (0.3125 mol / 0.735 mol) x 100% ≈ 42.5%

The [110] direction is angled at 45 degrees from the x-axis and y-axis, and 90 degrees from the z-axis.

The [111] direction is angled at 30 degrees from the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis.

To find the angle between [110] and [111], we can use the dot product method:

[110] = (1/2, 1/2, 1)

[111] = (1/3, 1/3, 1)

Dot product = [110]. [111] = (1/2*1/3 + 1/2*1/3 + 1*1/3) = (1/6 + 1/6 + 1/3) = 1/3

Magnitude of [110] = √(1/4 + 1/4 + 1) = √2/2 = 1/√2

Magnitude of [111] = √(1/9 + 1/9 + 1) = 2/3

Angle = cos^(-1) dot product / magnitude of [110] * magnitude of [111]

Angle = cos^(-1) (1/3) * (1/√2 * 2/3) = 35.26 degrees

A second-order phase transition is a phase transition that occurs when the free energy of the system has a non-analytic behavior, such as a discontinuity or a singularity. This type of transition is characterized by a continuous change in the system's properties, but with a sudden change in the slope of the curve.

In this case, the correct answer is:

(D) Heat capacity

Heat capacity is a measure of the amount of heat energy required to change the temperature of a system by a given amount. During a second-order phase transition, the heat capacity of the system exhibits a discontinuity, meaning that it changes suddenly and non-analytically as the system undergoes the phase transition.

The other options are not correct:

(A) Volume: While the volume of a system may change during a phase transition, it does not exhibit a discontinuity.

(B) Enthalpy: Enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a system, including both internal energy and the energy associated with the pressure and volume of the system. It does not exhibit a discontinuity during a second-order phase transition.

(C) Entropy: Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. While entropy may change during a phase transition, it does not exhibit a discontinuity.

Cross-slip is the phenomenon where a dislocation (a type of defect in a crystal lattice) switches from one slip plane to another, altering its path. This process is important in understanding metal plasticity and ductility.

When evaluating the conditions that promote cross-slip, we consider the energy required for a dislocation to change its slip plane. A low stacking fault energy (SFE) is favorable for cross-slip, as it allows the dislocation to move more easily across the slip plane.

Phase transition;5;G-XEC-2016-8;NUM;18;At equilibrium, the maximum number of phases that can coexist in a ternary system at constant pressure is;"A nice and simple question!

In a ternary system, we have three components (A, B, and C) that can form various phases (solid, liquid, gas, etc.). At equilibrium, the maximum number of phases that can coexist is determined by the Gibbs phase rule.

The Gibbs phase rule states that at constant pressure, the number of degrees of freedom (F) is given by:

F = C - P + 2

where C is the number of components and P is the number of phases.

In a ternary system, we have C = 3 components. The maximum number of phases that can coexist is limited by the number of degrees of freedom, which is F = 3 - P + 2.

To maximize the number of phases, we want to minimize the number of degrees of freedom. This occurs when F = 0, which means:

3 - P + 2 = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P = 1

So, at equilibrium, the maximum number of phases that can coexist in a ternary system at constant pressure is 1.

For the same material the fracture stress(in Mpa) for a critical flaw size of 90 μm will be?;"According to the Griffith's theory, the relationship between fracture stress (σ) and critical flaw size (a) is given by:

σ² ∝ 1/a

Rearranging the equation to solve for σ, we get:

σ ∝ 1/√a

For a given material, the fracture stress is proportional to the inverse square root of the critical flaw size.

Given the critical flaw size of 30 μm, the fracture stress is 300 MPa. To find the fracture stress for a critical flaw size of 90 μm, we can plug in the value for a:

σ = 300 MPa

since σ ∝ 1/√a, we can write:

300 MPa = k/√90 μm

where k is a constant. To find the value of k, we can divide both sides by 300 MPa and multiply by the square root of 30 μm:

k = 300 MPa \* √30 μm
k = approximately 174 MPa

Now that we have the value of k, we can find the fracture stress for a critical flaw size of 90 μm:

σ ≈ k/√90 μm

(A) Only (i) (B) Both (i) and (ii) (C) Both (i) and (iii) (D) Both (ii) and (iii);"Based on the context, we can analyze the question and provide an answer.

The question states that an inorganic material appears colored when doped with transition metal ions. This is because transition metal ions have unpaired electrons in their outermost energy level, which can absorb certain wavelengths of light and emit radiation of specific wavelengths.

Statement (ii) is true because the doped transition metal ions selectively absorb certain wavelengths of light, which is why the material appears colored. This is because the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands of the host material is filled by the doped transition metal ions, allowing them to absorb specific wavelengths of light.

Statement (iii) is also true because the absorbed energy is released as radiation of specific wavelengths, which is why the material appears colored.

Statement (i) is not necessarily true because the electronic energy levels of the host material may not change significantly by doping. The color of the material is primarily due to the absorption and emission of radiation by the transition metal ions, rather than a change in the electronic energy levels of the host material.

Hall effect measurement shows electron mobility to be 3.2 * $10^(-3)m^(2)V^(-1)s^(-1)$. Electrical resistivity of copper is 1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm. The average number of free electrons per atom in copper is ?;"A nice problem in solid-state physics!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the charge of an electron (e) is 1.6 × 10^(-19) C.
2. We're given the lattice parameter of copper (a = 3.62 Å).
3. The Hall effect measurement provides the electron mobility (μ) of 3.2 × 10^(-3) m^2 V^-1 s^-1.
4. We're given the electrical resistivity of copper (ρ) as 1.7 × 10^(-8) Ωm.

Now, we need to find the average number of free electrons per atom in copper.

We can start by using the Drude equation for the electrical conductivity (σ):

σ = ne μ

where σ is the electrical conductivity, n is the number density of free electrons, and μ is the electron mobility.

We're given the electrical resistivity (ρ), so we can use the formula:

σ = 1/ρ

Now, substitute the given values:

(1/ρ) = ne μ

Simplify the equation:

n = (1/ρ) / (μ)

Now, we need to find the number density (n) in atoms per unit volume. We can use the atomic density of copper (ρCu):

n = ρCu / N

where N is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol).

The atomic density of copper is:

ρCu = (mass of copper atom) / (volume of copper unit cell)

The atomic mass of copper is 63.55 g/mol. The volume of a sphere (i.e., the unit cell of FCC copper) is:

V = (4/3)πa³

Now, plug in the values:

V = (4/3)π(3.62 Å)^3 ≈ 1.23 x 10^(-9) m³

The mass of a copper atom is ≈ 63.55 g/mol. Convert it to kg:

m = 63.55 g/mol × (1 kg) / (1000 g)

Now, find the number density:

n = (mass of copper atom) / (volume of copper unit cell)

Combine the values:

n ≈ (63.55 g/mol × (1 kg) / (1000 g)) / (1.23 x 10^(-9) m³)

Simplify the expression:

n ≈ 5.13 x 10^22 atoms/m³

Now, use the simplified equation:

n = (1/ρ) / (μ)

Plug in the values:

5.13 x 10^22 atoms/m³ = (1/1.7 x 10^(-8) Ωm) / (3.2 x 10^(-3) m^2 V^-1 s^-1)

Simplify the expression:

n ≈ 1.04 x 10^29 free electrons/atom

Now, we can find the average number of free electrons per atom:

1.04 x 10^29 free electrons/atom ≈ 14 free electrons/atom

So, the average number of free electrons per atom in copper is approximately:

The maximum coordination number of the cation in the structure will be  (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 8;"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ionic radii and coordination number.

The ionic radius of the cation is 0.8 Å and the anion is 1.6 Å. The coordination number is the number of anions that can be arranged around a central cation in a crystal lattice.

The maximum coordination number of the cation is determined by the size of the cation and the anion. The cation with the smaller radius can coordinate with more anions, while the cation with the larger radius can coordinate with fewer anions.

In this case, the cation has a radius of 0.8 Å, which is smaller than the anion's radius of 1.6 Å. Therefore, the cation can coordinate with more anions.

The maximum coordination number of the cation is determined by the size of the anion. The anion with the larger radius can accommodate more cations, while the anion with the smaller radius can accommodate fewer cations.

In this case, the anion has a radius of 1.6 Å, which is larger than the cation's radius of 0.8 Å. Therefore, the anion can accommodate more cations.

Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of how much a material is affected by a magnetic field. There are three main types of materials: diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic.

* Diamagnetic materials have a negative magnetic susceptibility, meaning they are weakly repelled by magnetic fields. This is because the electrons in the material are paired up and aligned in such a way that they cancel out the magnetic field.
* Paramagnetic materials have a positive magnetic susceptibility, meaning they are weakly attracted to magnetic fields. This is because the electrons in the material are not paired up and are aligned in the same direction as the magnetic field.
* Ferromagnetic materials have a strong positive magnetic susceptibility, meaning they are strongly attracted to magnetic fields. This is because the electrons in the material are aligned in the same direction, creating a strong magnetic field.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

* (i) Magnetic susceptibility is positive for a diamagnetic material: False (diamagnetic materials have negative susceptibility)

During deformation of a semi-crystalline polymer with a spherulitic morphology, the stressed polymer is subjected to tension. At the later stages, the amorphous regions and crystalline regions behave differently.

The amorphous regions, which are the non-crystalline regions between the crystalline spherulites, tend to elongate in the direction of the stress. This is because the amorphous regions are more flexible and can deform more easily under stress.

On the other hand, the crystalline regions, which are the spherulites themselves, experience bending and stretching of their molecular chains. This is because the crystalline regions are more rigid and require more energy to deform.

(i) Polymers that are less coiled are more crystalline than those that are more coiled:

This statement is true. When polymers are less coiled, they have a more linear structure, which allows for more efficient packing and formation of crystalline structures. On the other hand, more coiled polymers have a more disordered structure, making it harder for them to form crystalline structures.

(ii) Branched polymers are more crystalline than the linear ones:

This statement is false. Branched polymers have a more disordered structure due to the presence of branches, which can disrupt the formation of crystalline structures. Linear polymers, on the other hand, have a more linear structure, which allows for more efficient packing and formation of crystalline structures.

(iii) Polymers with inter-chain interactions have higher glass transition temperature than those without inter-chain interactions:

This statement is true. Inter-chain interactions can increase the energy required for the polymer chains to move and relax, resulting in a higher glass transition temperature.

(iv) Polymers with inter-chain interactions are more crystalline than those without inter-chain interactions:

This statement is false. While inter-chain interactions can increase the energy required for the polymer chains to move and relax, they do not necessarily lead to the formation of crystalline structures. In fact, strong inter-chain interactions can sometimes disrupt the formation of crystalline structures.

Ceramic materials are known for their high theoretical strength, but they often fail at stresses much lower than expected. This is due to the presence of defects or imperfections in the material, which can act as stress concentrators and reduce the material's overall strength.

The correct answer is:

(C) Presence of voids

Voids, or empty spaces, within the ceramic material can create stress concentrations that can lead to premature failure. Additionally, dislocations (A) are a common feature of crystalline materials, but they are not typically a major contributor to ceramic failure. High elastic modulus (B) is a material property that describes its stiffness, but it is not directly related to ceramic failure.

Calculate the density of the sample in g $cm^(-3)$ (give answer up to 2 decimal places);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The apparent mass of the sample in water is 1.67 g, which means that the sample appears to lose 2.67 - 1.67 = 1.00 g of mass when it is submerged in water.
2. This loss of mass is due to the buoyant force exerted by the water on the sample. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the sample.
3. The weight of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the sample multiplied by the density of water (1.00 g/cm³).
4. Since the sample loses 1.00 g of mass, the volume of the sample is equal to 1.00 g / 1.00 g/cm³ = 1.00 cm³.
5. The mass of the sample in air is 2.67 g, so its density can be calculated as:

The fundamental accuracy with which the position of the electron can be determined simultaneously with the speed in the same experiment in mm? (give answer up to 2 decimal places)";"To solve this problem, we can use the uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is greater than or equal to Planck's constant divided by 4π.

Δx \* Δp >= h / (4π)

We are given the uncertainty in speed (Δv) and the mass of the electron (m). We can use the equation Δp = m \* Δv to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp).

Δp = m \* Δv
= (9.1 * 10^(-31) kg) \* (0.01% \* 300 m/s)
= 2.73 * 10^(-24) kg m/s

Now we can plug in the values to find the uncertainty in position (Δx).

Δx \* (2.73 * 10^(-24) kg m/s) >= (6.6 * 10^(-34) J s) / (4π)
Δx >= (6.6 * 10^(-34) J s) / (4π \* 2.73 * 10^(-24) kg m/s)
Δx >= 9.43 * 10^(-11) m

To convert this to millimeters, we multiply by 1000 (since there are 1000 mm in 1 m).

Δx >= 9.43 * 10^(-8) mm

Thermodynamics;20;G-XEC-2018-18;NUM;42;When 3 identical non-interacting spin ½ particles are put in an infinite potential well, the ground state energy of the system is 18 meV. If instead, seven particles are put inside the potential well, the new ground state energy in meV is?;"Since the particles are identical and non-interacting, the ground state energy of the system is proportional to the number of particles. Specifically, the ground state energy is given by:

E = (n^2 π^2)/(2mL^2)

where n is the number of particles, m is the mass of a particle, and L is the width of the potential well.

Given that the ground state energy for 3 particles is 18 meV, we can write:

Simplifying this equation, we get:

A cubic crystal is a crystal with a face-centered cubic (FCC) or body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. To have a minimum symmetry, a cubic crystal must possess a center of symmetry, which is also known as a point of inversion.

A center of symmetry is a point in the crystal where the symmetry operations of rotation, reflection, and glide reflection all pass through. This means that if you were to draw a line through the center of symmetry, the crystal would look the same on both sides of the line.

The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the pattern is;"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of X-ray diffraction and the properties of FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) crystals.

In X-ray diffraction, a beam of X-rays is incident on a polycrystalline sample, and the scattered X-rays are detected. The intensity of the scattered X-rays depends on the arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice. For a FCC crystal, the atoms are arranged in a specific pattern, which affects the diffraction pattern.

The lattice parameter of FCC aluminum is given as 0.405 nm. This means that the distance between the centers of two adjacent atoms in the same plane is 0.405 nm.

The wavelength of the Cr-Kα radiation is given as 0.229 nm. This means that the distance between the crests of the X-ray wave is 0.229 nm.

The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern is determined by the Bragg equation:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the distance between the planes of atoms in the crystal lattice, and θ is the angle of incidence.

For a FCC crystal, the distance between the planes of atoms is given by:

d = a/√2

where a is the lattice parameter.

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

d = 0.405 nm / √2 ≈ 0.287 nm

Now, we can use the Bragg equation to find the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern:

nλ = 2dsin(θ)

Rearranging the equation to solve for n, we get:

n = (2dsin(θ)) / λ

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

n = (2 × 0.287 nm × sin(θ)) / 0.229 nm

Since the angle of incidence (θ) is not given, we cannot find the exact value of n. However, we can find the maximum value of n by assuming that the angle of incidence is 90° (i.e., the X-rays are incident perpendicular to the planes of atoms).

In this case, the maximum value of n is:

n = (2 × 0.287 nm × sin(90°)) / 0.229 nm ≈ 6.3

Since n must be an integer, the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern is 6.

Planar atomic density = (1/a^2) \* √2

where a is the lattice parameter.

Given: lattice parameter of iron is 0.287 nm

First, we need to convert the lattice parameter from nanometers to angstroms (1 nm = 10 Å):

a = 0.287 nm = 2.87 Å

Now, we can plug in the value of a into the formula:

Planar atomic density = (1/(2.87 Å)^2) \* √2
= (1/8.23 Å^2) \* √2
= 0.12/Å^2 \* √2
= 0.21/Å^2

To convert the planar atomic density from Å^2 to nm^(-2), we can multiply by (1 nm)^2:

Planar atomic density = 0.21/Å^2 \* (1 nm)^2
= 0.21 nm^(-2)

So, the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal is 0.21 nm^(-2).

Mild steel is carburized at 1300 K for 1 hour to obtain a certain case depth. Keeping the time as 1 hour, the case depth can be doubled by increasing the temperature to what temperature(in K)? (round off to the nearest whole number);"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The rate of a chemical reaction is given by the Arrhenius equation:

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

where k is the rate constant, A is the frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given that the activation energy (Ea) is 148 kJ/mol, and the gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/mol·K.

We want to find the temperature at which the case depth can be doubled, keeping the time constant at 1 hour. This means that the rate of the reaction will be doubled.

Let's assume that the rate constant (k) is proportional to the case depth. Then, if the case depth is doubled, the rate constant will also be doubled.

We can write an equation based on the Arrhenius equation:

k1 = Ae^(-148000/RT1)
k2 = 2Ae^(-148000/RT2)

where k1 and k2 are the rate constants at the initial and final temperatures, respectively.

Since the rate constant is doubled, we can set up the equation:

2Ae^(-148000/RT1) = Ae^(-148000/RT2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

e^(-148000/RT1) = 2e^(-148000/RT2)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

-148000/RT1 = ln(2) - 148000/RT2

Rearranging the equation, we get:

RT2 = RT1 + 148000/ln(2)

Substituting the values, we get:

RT2 = RT1 + 148000/0.693

Rearranging the equation, we get:

T2 = T1 + 2143 K

Since the initial temperature is 1300 K, the final temperature (T2) is:

T2 = 1300 + 2143 = 3443 K

Here's a brief explanation:

A screw dislocation is a type of dislocation that occurs in crystals. It is characterized by a dislocation line and a Burgers vector that are not parallel, unlike an edge dislocation. When a screw dislocation moves, the atoms around it are displaced in the direction of the dislocation line, which is perpendicular to the slip plane. This is in contrast to a edge dislocation, where the dislocation line and the Burgers vector are parallel, and the atomic displacement is in the direction of the slip plane.

Nickel corrodes at 298 K in a solution of 0.06 M nickel chloride having pH 4. Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we can use the following equation:

E°(reaction) = E°(reduction) - E°(oxidation)

Where E°(reaction) is the standard reduction potential of the reaction, E°(reduction) is the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction being reduced, and E°(oxidation) is the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction being oxidized.

The reaction being considered is the corrosion of nickel in a solution of nickel chloride:

Ni(s) + NiCl2(aq) → NiCl(aq) + NiCl3(aq)

The reduction half-reaction is:

Ni2+(aq) + 2e- → Ni(s)

The oxidation half-reaction is:

Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e-

The standard reduction potentials for these half-reactions are:

E°(reduction) = -0.25 V
E°(oxidation) = 0.00 V

Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

Next, we need to calculate the potential of the reaction in the given conditions. Using the Nernst equation:

E = E°(reaction) + (RT/nF)

Where E is the potential of the reaction, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is the Faraday constant.

To solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation:

The kinetic energy of the electron is equal to the potential energy it gains as it is accelerated across the 300 kV potential. We can find the potential energy using the equation:

Substituting the values, we get:

p = (2 * 9.11*10^(-31) kg * 4.8*10^(-17) J)^(1/2) = 3.34*10^(-23) kg m/s

Now we can find the wavelength of the electron using the de Broglie equation:

The stress on the polymer must remain above 14.5 MPa in order for the assembly to function properly. The expected life(in hours) of the assembly is? (round off to the nearest integer);"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. The initial stress is 17 MPa, and it drops to 16.6 MPa after 100 hours, so the stress drops by 17 - 16.6 = 0.4 MPa.
2. The stress must remain above 14.5 MPa for the assembly to function properly. This means that the stress will drop from 17 MPa to 14.5 MPa, and we want to know how many hours it will take for the stress to drop from 17 MPa to 14.5 MPa.
3. The stress drops by 0.4 MPa in 100 hours. To find the expected life of the assembly, we need to find the time it takes for the stress to drop from 17 MPa to 14.5 MPa.

We can set up the equation:

0.4 = (17 - 14.5) / x

where x is the expected life (in hours).

Solving for x:

0.4 = (2.5) / x

x = 2.5 / 0.4

(round off to the nearest integer);"Since the question is asking for the stress required to change the polarization, we can use the definition of piezoelectricity, which states that a piezoelectric material generates an electric charge in response to mechanical stress.

Let's denote the change in polarization as ΔP = 645 C/m³ - 640 C/m³ = 5 C/m³.

We can use the following equation to relate the change in polarization to the stress:

ΔP = k \* σ

where k is the piezoelectric constant, and σ is the stress.

Rearranging the equation to solve for σ, we get:

σ = ΔP / k

We are given the Young's modulus of the material, which is 72 GPa. However, we need to convert it to Pa to match the units of stress:

72 GPa = 72,000,000,000 Pa

Now, we can use the following equation to relate the Young's modulus to the piezoelectric constant:

k = (ΔP / σ) \* E

where E is the Young's modulus.

Substituting the values, we get:

k = (5 C/m³ / σ) \* 72,000,000,000 Pa

Now, we can solve for σ:

The electric current(in amperes) required to generate the necessary magnetic field is?  (round off to 1 decimal place);"To demagnetize the iron bar magnet, we need to generate a magnetic field that is strong enough to overcome the coercivity of the magnet. The coercivity of the magnet is given as 7000 A/m.

The magnetic field (B) generated by the solenoid can be calculated using the formula:

B = μ₀nI

where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current in the solenoid.

We are given that the solenoid has 150 turns of wire and is 0.25 m long, so the number of turns per unit length (n) is:

n = 150 turns / 0.25 m = 600 turns/m

The permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant, approximately equal to 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A.

To demagnetize the magnet, we need to generate a magnetic field that is strong enough to overcome the coercivity of the magnet. This means that the magnetic field (B) generated by the solenoid should be greater than or equal to the coercivity (H) of the magnet.

B ≥ H

Substituting the values, we get:

μ₀nI ≥ 7000 A/m

Substituting the values, we get:

(4π × 10^-7 T·m/A) × (600 turns/m) × I ≥ 7000 A/m

NaCl is a rock salt, which is a typical ionic compound. It consists of sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). The sodium ion has a charge of +1, while the chloride ion has a charge of -1.

When a Ca2+ ion substitutes for a Na+ ion in NaCl, it would lead to a change in the charge balance of the compound. The Ca2+ ion has a charge of +2, which is twice the charge of the Na+ ion. To maintain charge neutrality, the compound would need to compensate for the extra positive charge.

One way to do this would be to create a vacancy in the chloride ion sublattice. This means that a Cl- ion would be removed from its normal position in the crystal lattice, leaving a gap or vacancy. This would balance out the extra positive charge from the Ca2+ ion.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

We know that the diffusion coefficient of copper in aluminum at 400 °C is 5*10^(-14) m^2 s^(-1) and at 500 °C is 6*10^(-13) m^2 s^(-1). We also know that the same concentration of copper is required at the same depth in both experiments.

The diffusion equation is given by:

where x is the depth, D is the diffusion coefficient, and t is the time.

Since the same concentration is required at the same depth, we can set up the following equation:

Given:

* Atomic weight of C = 12
* Atomic weight of Fe = 56
* Carbon (C) in iron (Fe) is 6% by weight

We need to find the atomic percent of carbon in iron.

First, let's find the weight of carbon in 100 grams of iron:

Weight of carbon = 6% of 100 g = 6 g

Now, let's find the number of moles of carbon:

Number of moles of carbon = weight of carbon / atomic weight of carbon
= 6 g / 12 g/mol
= 0.5 mol

Now, let's find the number of moles of iron:

Number of moles of iron = weight of iron / atomic weight of iron
= 100 g / 56 g/mol
= 1.79 mol (approximately)

Now, let's find the atomic percent of carbon:

Atomic percent of carbon = (number of moles of carbon / total number of moles) × 100

We are given that the energy gap of Germanium (Ge) is 0.67 eV. We need to find the maximum wavelength of radiation to which Ge is opaque.

We know that the energy of a photon (E) is related to its frequency (f) by the equation:

E = hf

where h is Planck's constant.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for frequency:

f = E / h

We are also given that 1 eV = 1.6*10^(-19) J, so we can convert the energy gap from eV to Joules:

0.67 eV = 0.67 * 1.6*10^(-19) J = 1.072*10^(-19) J

Now we can use the equation for frequency to find the frequency corresponding to the energy gap:

f = 1.072*10^(-19) J / (6.63*10^(-34) J s) = 1.62*10^14 Hz

The wavelength (λ) is related to the frequency by the equation:

λ = c / f

where c is the velocity of light. Plugging in the values, we get:

λ = (3*10^8 m/s) / (1.62*10^14 Hz) = 1.85*10^-6 m = 1.85 μm

So, the maximum wavelength of radiation to which Germanium is opaque is approximately 1.85 μm.

In an SEM, the interaction between the electron beam and the sample is responsible for the production of backscattered electrons. The probability of backscattering is dependent on the atomic number of the element. Elements with higher atomic numbers tend to have a higher probability of backscattering, while elements with lower atomic numbers have a lower probability.

In this problem, we are given the composition of the α- and β-phases in the Pb-Sn sample. The α-phase contains 97 wt% Pb (atomic number 82) and the β-phase contains 99 wt% Sn (atomic number 50).

Statement-1: Sintering in vacuum leads to improved densification as compared to sintering under ambient (at atmospheric pressure) condition.

This statement is TRUE. Sintering in vacuum can lead to improved densification because there are no impurities or gases present to hinder the sintering process. In contrast, sintering under ambient conditions can be affected by the presence of impurities or gases, which can lead to defects and reduced densification.

Statement-2: Closed pores formed during sintering inhibit full densification.

This statement is also TRUE. Closed pores can prevent full densification because they can trap air or other gases, making it difficult for the material to fully densify. Additionally, closed pores can also create stress concentrations, which can lead to defects or even cracking.

The smallest integer value of ‘n’ such that P(n) ≤ ½ is? (round off to the nearest integer);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The probability of an accident occurring in a given month is 1/100, which means the probability of no accident occurring in a given month is 1 - 1/100 = 99/100.
2. Since the events of individual months are independent of each other, the probability of no accident occurring over a period of 'n' months is the product of the probabilities of no accident occurring in each month.
3. Let's denote the probability of no accident occurring over a period of 'n' months as P(n). Then, P(n) = (99/100)^n.
4. We are asked to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½.
5. To solve this, we can set up the inequality (99/100)^n ≤ ½ and solve for 'n'.

(99/100)^n ≤ ½
(99/100)^n ≤ (1/2)
(99/100)^n ≤ (1/2)^1
(99/100)^n ≤ (1/2)^1

Now, we can take the logarithm of both sides to get:

n log(99/100) ≤ log(1/2)

Since log(1/2) is negative, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get:

n log(99/100) ≥ -log(1/2)

Now, we can use the fact that log(99/100) is approximately 0.0099 (since 99/100 is very close to 1). So, we can approximate the inequality as:

n × 0.0099 ≥ -log(1/2)

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

n × 0.0099 ≥ 0.301

Dividing both sides by 0.0099, we get:

Assume that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy.;"To solve this question, we need to calculate the surface energy of each surface and then find the ratio.

The surface energy (γ) of a FCC metal can be calculated by considering the broken bonds at the surface. Each metal atom has four nearest neighbor bonds in the bulk, which are broken when the atom is placed at the surface.

The {111} surface has a higher density of broken bonds than the {100} surface. Each atom at the {111} surface has three broken bonds, while each atom at the {100} surface has only two broken bonds.

The surface energy (γ) of a FCC metal can be calculated using the following formula:

γ = (nbonds/atom) * (energy of a broken bond) * (1/ surface area)

where nbonds/atom is the number of broken bonds per atom, energy of a broken bond is the energy released when a bond is broken, and surface area is the area of the surface.

The surface area of a {111} surface is √3 * (plane spacing)^2, where the plane spacing is the distance between the lattice planes. In a FCC metal, the plane spacing is √2 * a, where a is the lattice parameter.

The surface area of a {100} surface is (plane spacing)^2.

For a FCC metal with lattice parameter a, we can calculate the surface energy of each surface as follows:

γ111 = 3 * (energy of a broken bond) * (1/ (√3 * (√2 * a)^2))
γ100 = 2 * (energy of a broken bond) * (1/ ((√2 * a)^2))

We can express the ratio of surface energies as:

γ111 / γ100 = (3 * (energy of a broken bond) * (1/ (√3 * (√2 * a)^2))) / (2 * (energy of a broken bond) * (1/ ((√2 * a)^2)))

Simplifying the ratio, we get:

ni ≈ 1.45 * 10^10 m^(-3)

Now, let's calculate the shift in Fermi energy upon doping:

The Fermi energy (EF) is related to the intrinsic carrier concentration (ni) by the following equation:

EF = kBT * ln(ni/n0)

where n0 is the doping concentration.

Given values:

n0 = 1 ppm * 5 * 10^(28) atoms/m^3 = 5 * 10^(21) m^(-3)

EF = kBT * ln(ni/n0)
EF = 1.38 * 10^(-23) J/K * ln(1.45 * 10^10 m^(-3) / 5 * 10^(21) m^(-3))
EF ≈ -0.23 eV

The shift in Fermi energy (ΔEF) is the difference between the Fermi energy of the doped sample and the intrinsic Fermi energy of pure silicon:

ΔEF = EF - EF_intrinsic
ΔEF = -0.23 eV - 0 eV
ΔEF ≈ -0.23 eV

So, the correct answer is:

The magneteic moments of cations on octahedral sites are antiparallel with respect to those on tetrahedral sites. Atomic number of Fe is 26 and that of O is 8. The saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_(3)O_(4)$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons ($µ_B$) will be ? Ignore contribution from orbital magnetic moments.;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The material is a FCC structured inverse spinel (AB2O4) material, which means it has a face-centered cubic lattice with A and B cations occupying the lattice sites.
2. 1/8 of the tetrahedral sites are occupied by half of the B cations. This means that each tetrahedral site is occupied by 1/4 of a B cation.
3. 1/2 of the octahedral sites are occupied by the remaining B and A cations. This means that each octahedral site is occupied by 1/2 of an A cation and 1/4 of a B cation.
4. The magnetic moments of the cations on octahedral sites are antiparallel with respect to those on tetrahedral sites. This means that the magnetic moments of the A cations and 1/4 of the B cations on octahedral sites will cancel each other out, leaving only the magnetic moments of the remaining 1/4 of the B cations on octahedral sites.
5. The atomic number of Fe is 26, which means that each Fe atom has 26 electrons. The atomic number of O is 8, which means that each O atom has 8 electrons.
6. Since the problem ignores the contribution from orbital magnetic moments, we only need to consider the spin magnetic moments of the electrons.
7. The spin magnetic moment of an electron is given by the Bohr magneton (µB), which is approximately 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T.
8. The total spin magnetic moment of a Fe atom is 5 (since it has 26 electrons, and each electron has a spin of 1/2). The total spin magnetic moment of an O atom is 0 (since it has 8 electrons, and each electron has a spin of 1/2).
9. Since 1/4 of the B cations on octahedral sites are occupied by Fe cations, the total spin magnetic moment of these Fe cations is 5/4 (since 1/4 of the Fe cations have a spin magnetic moment of 5).
10. Since the remaining 1/4 of the B cations on octahedral sites are occupied by O cations, the total spin magnetic moment of these O cations is 0.
11. The total spin magnetic moment of the material is the sum of the spin magnetic moments of the Fe cations and the O cations. Since the spin magnetic moments of the Fe cations and O cations on octahedral sites cancel each other out, the total spin magnetic moment of the material is the spin magnetic moment of the 1/4 of the B cations on tetrahedral sites, which is 5/4.

Therefore, the saturation magnetic moment of Fe3O4 per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons (µB) is:

The correct answer is:

(B) Intensity of radiation

The minimum feature size that can be theoretically resolved in an optical microscope depends on the wavelength of radiation (C), refractive index of the medium between the lens and the focal point (A), and numerical aperture of the objective lens (D). The intensity of radiation (B) is not a factor in determining the minimum feature size that can be resolved.

Here's a brief explanation:

* Wavelength of radiation (C): The minimum feature size is limited by the diffraction limit, which is inversely proportional to the wavelength of radiation.
* Refractive index of the medium (A): The refractive index affects the numerical aperture of the objective lens, which in turn affects the resolution.
* Numerical aperture of the objective lens (D): The numerical aperture determines the angular resolution of the microscope, which affects the minimum feature size that can be resolved.
* Intensity of radiation (B): The intensity of radiation does not directly affect the minimum feature size that can be resolved.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Intensity of radiation.";;B;1;

The ΔW/A (in mg.$cm^(-2)$) after 500 min at 600°C will be? (round-off to two decimal places).;"Since the weight gain per unit area follows the parabolic rate law, we can write the equation as:

ΔW/A = k.t^n

where k is the rate constant, t is the time, and n is the exponent.

We are given that ΔW/A = 1.0 mg.cm^(-2) after 100 min of oxidation, so we can write:

1.0 = k.100^n

We are asked to find ΔW/A after 500 min of oxidation, so we can write:

ΔW/A = k.500^n

To find the value of k, we can divide the first equation by the second:

k.100^n / k.500^n = 1.0 / 5.0

k.100^n / k.500^n = 0.2

k = 0.2 / (100^n / 500^n)

k = 0.2 / (2^n)

Now we can find ΔW/A after 500 min of oxidation:

ΔW/A = k.500^n
= 0.2 / (2^n).500^n
= 0.2 / 2^n

Since n is the exponent, we can assume it to be 0.5 (which is a common value for parabolic rate law). Then:

ΔW/A = 0.2 / 2^0.5
= 0.2 / 1.414
= 0.1414

The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer).;"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of diffusion and the error function (erf) to calculate the time required for the carbon concentration to reach 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5 mm.

First, we need to calculate the diffusion distance (x) required to achieve the desired carbon concentration (0.46 wt%) at a depth of 5 mm. We can use the error function (erf) to do this:

erf(z) = (1 - erf(5/x)) = 1 - erf(5/x) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

where z is the depth of the sample (5 mm) and x is the diffusion distance.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2.15 mm

Now, we can use Fick's law of diffusion to calculate the time required for the carbon concentration to reach 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5 mm:

t = x^2 / (2 \* D \* C)

where t is the time, x is the diffusion distance, D is the diffusivity of carbon in iron (6.0 \* 10^-11 m^2/s), and C is the carbon concentration (0.46 wt%).

Plugging in the values, we get:

t = (2.15 mm)^2 / (2 \* 6.0 \* 10^-11 m^2/s \* 0.46 wt%)

The lowest value of $T_f$( in °C) at which material will fail is?(round off to the nearest integer.). Assume that there is no plastic deformation during thermal cycling.;"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The material is dimensionally constrained, which means it cannot change its volume during thermal cycling.
2. The material can withstand a maximum compressive stress of 200 MPa without failure.
3. The coefficient of thermal expansion (α) is 7.5 × 10^(-6) °C^(-1), which means that for every degree Celsius change in temperature, the material expands or contracts by 7.5 × 10^(-6) times its original length.
4. The modulus of elasticity (E) is 200 GPa, which is a measure of the material's stiffness.

During thermal cycling, the material will expand when heated and contract when cooled. Since it is dimensionally constrained, the expansion and contraction will cause compressive stresses in the material.

Let's calculate the maximum compressive stress that occurs when the material is heated to Tf:

ΔL = α × L × (Tf - 25°C)
= 7.5 × 10^(-6) × L × (Tf - 25°C)

where ΔL is the change in length, L is the original length of the material, and Tf is the final temperature.

The compressive stress (σ) is given by:

σ = -E × (ΔL / L)
= -200 GPa × (ΔL / L)

We can set up an equation using the given maximum compressive stress of 200 MPa:

-200 MPa = -200 GPa × (ΔL / L)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

ΔL / L = 1 MPa / 200 GPa
= 5 × 10^(-9)

Now, substitute this value back into the equation for ΔL:

ΔL = 5 × 10^(-9) × L

Substitute this expression for ΔL into the equation for σ:

σ = -200 GPa × (5 × 10^(-9) × L) / L
= -1 MPa

This is the maximum compressive stress that occurs when the material is heated to Tf. Since the material can withstand a maximum compressive stress of 200 MPa without failure, we can set up an equation:

-1 MPa = 200 MPa

Solving for Tf, we get:

Tf = 25°C + 1/7.5 × 10^(-6) × 200 GPa × L
= 25°C + 266.67°C
= 291.67°C

1. The given information is:
	* Atomic weight of Fe = 55.8
	* Atomic weight of C = 12.0
	* Avogadro's number = 6.023 × 10^23
	* Lattice parameter of austenite = 4 Å
	* Composition of austenite: Fe - 10 atom % C (no Fe vacancies)
2. We need to find the density of austenite in g/cm^3.
3. First, let's find the number of atoms of Fe and C in the austenite lattice. Since the composition is Fe - 10 atom % C, it means that 10% of the atoms are C and the remaining 90% are Fe.
	* Number of Fe atoms = 0.9 × (total number of atoms)
	* Number of C atoms = 0.1 × (total number of atoms)
4. The lattice parameter is given as 4 Å, which is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the lattice. Since the lattice is face-centered cubic (fcc), each atom has 12 nearest neighbors.
	* Volume of a single atom = (4 Å)^3 / 4 = 16 Å^3
	* Volume of the lattice = number of atoms × volume of a single atom = (total number of atoms) × 16 Å^3
5. Now, let's find the total number of atoms in the lattice. Since the lattice is fcc, each atom has 12 nearest neighbors, and the lattice parameter is 4 Å, we can use the following formula to find the number of atoms:

Number of atoms = (4 Å / √2)^3 / 16 Å^3 = 4.32 × 10^22 atoms

6. Now that we have the total number of atoms, we can find the number of Fe and C atoms:

Number of Fe atoms = 0.9 × 4.32 × 10^22 = 3.888 × 10^22 atoms
Number of C atoms = 0.1 × 4.32 × 10^22 = 0.432 × 10^22 atoms
7. The total mass of the lattice is the sum of the masses of all the atoms:

Total mass = (Number of Fe atoms × mass of Fe atom) + (Number of C atoms × mass of C atom)
= (3.888 × 10^22 × 55.8 g/mol) + (0.432 × 10^22 × 12.0 g/mol)

= 2.179 × 10^23 g

The molar volumes of α and β phases are 7.377 $cm^3$ and 7.317 $cm^3$ , respectively. Assume that the difference in molar volumes of α and β is independent of pressure. The pressure (in atm) required for α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is (round off to nearest integer);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The enthalpy of transformation (ΔH) is given as 912 J/mol. This means that the energy required to transform 1 mole of α phase to β phase is 912 J.
2. The molar volumes of α and β phases are given as 7.377 cm³ and 7.317 cm³, respectively. The difference in molar volumes is ΔV = 7.377 - 7.317 = 0.06 cm³/mol.
3. Since the difference in molar volumes is independent of pressure, we can assume that the volume change (ΔV) remains constant at all pressures.
4. At 1 atm, the transformation occurs at 773 K. We need to find the pressure required for the transformation to occur at 723 K.
5. The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.
6. Since the volume change (ΔV) is constant, we can write:

ΔV = Vβ - Vα = nRT/P

where Vβ and Vα are the molar volumes of β and α phases, respectively.
7. Rearranging the equation to solve for P, we get:

P = nRT/ΔV

8. We are given the molar volume difference (ΔV) and the temperature (T). We need to find the pressure (P) required for the transformation to occur at 723 K.
9. First, we need to find the number of moles (n) required for the transformation. Since the enthalpy of transformation (ΔH) is given, we can use the following equation:

ΔH = nRT

where R is the gas constant. Rearranging the equation to solve for n, we get:

n = ΔH / RT

10. Plugging in the values, we get:

n = 912 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K × 723 K) ≈ 0.143 mol

11. Now, we can find the pressure required for the transformation to occur at 723 K:

P = nRT/ΔV
= (0.143 mol × 8.314 J/mol·K × 723 K) / 0.06 cm³/mol
≈ 1.01325 × 10^5 Pa / 1 atm
≈ 1 atm

Therefore, the pressure required for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is approximately 1 atm.

1. Let the weight percentage of α phase be x and the weight percentage of β phase be (100 - x)%. Since the ratio of weight percentages of α to β is 4, we can write:

70% of 80% = 56%

Note that the remaining 44% of α phase contains B. Since the total weight percentage of α is 80%, the total weight percentage of A in α is:

56% + (44% of 56%) = 56% + 24.48% = 80%

5. Since the weight percentage of B in the α phase is 44%, the weight percentage of B in the alloy is:

44% of (80% + 20%) = 44% of 100% = 44%

6. Since the weight percentage of A in β phase is 20%, the weight percentage of A in β is 20%. The remaining 80% of β phase contains B.

7. Thus, the weight percentage of B in the alloy is:

80% of (20% + 80%) = 80% of 100% = 80%

8. Add the weight percentages of A and B in the α phase:

56% (A in α) + 44% (B in α) = 100%

9. Add the weight percentages of A and B in the β phase:

20% (A in β) + 80% (B in β) = 100%

10. Since the weight percentages add up to 100% in both α and β phases, the total weight percentage of A in the alloy is:

(56% + 20%) + (44% B in α + 80% B in β) = 76%

11. The weight percentage of B in the alloy is therefore:

100% - 76% = 24%

During heating, Ti undergoes allotropic transformation from hcp to bcc at 882 °C. The percent volume change accompanying this transformation is (round off to 1 decimal place)";"To solve this problem, we need to find the volume change accompanying the transformation from hcp to bcc Ti.

First, we need to find the volume of hcp Ti. The density of hcp Ti is given as 4.51 g/cm³. We can use the formula:

Volume = Mass / Density

We are not given the mass of Ti, but we can use the atomic weight to find the mass of one mole of Ti. The atomic weight of Ti is 47.9 g/mol. We can use the Avogadro's number to find the number of moles in one gram of Ti:

1 g Ti = 1 mol Ti / 47.9 g/mol = 0.0209 mol Ti

Now, we can find the mass of one mole of Ti:

1 mol Ti = 47.9 g/mol

Now, we can find the volume of one mole of hcp Ti:

Volume of 1 mol hcp Ti = Mass of 1 mol hcp Ti / Density of hcp Ti
= 47.9 g / 4.51 g/cm³
= 10.57 cm³

Now, we need to find the volume of bcc Ti. The lattice parameter of bcc Ti is given as 0.332 nm. We can use the formula:

Volume of unit cell = (4/3) \* π \* (lattice parameter)³

Volume of unit cell of bcc Ti = (4/3) \* π \* (0.332 nm)³
= 0.0241 nm³

Now, we can find the volume of one mole of bcc Ti:

Volume of 1 mol bcc Ti = Number of unit cells in 1 mol bcc Ti \* Volume of unit cell
= 6.023 × 10²³ unit cells / mol \* 0.0241 nm³
= 145.4 cm³

Now, we can find the percent volume change:

Percent volume change = (Volume of bcc Ti - Volume of hcp Ti) / Volume of hcp Ti \* 100
= (145.4 cm³ - 10.57 cm³) / 10.57 cm³ \* 100
= 37.8%

If the applied load is 10 kg and the average length of diagonals of square indentation is 0.5 mm, the Vickers hardness in kg $mm^(−2)$ is? (round off to nearest integer);"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for Vickers hardness:

HV = (1.85425 \* P) / d^2

where HV is the Vickers hardness, P is the applied load, and d is the average length of the diagonals of the square indentation.

Given values:
P = 10 kg
d = 0.5 mm

First, we need to convert the load from kg to N:
P = 10 kg \* 9.81 N/kg = 98.1 N

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:
HV = (1.85425 \* 98.1) / (0.5)^2
HV = 187.4 kg/mm^2

* Charge of an electron (e) = 1.6 × 10^-19 C

Thermodynamics;40;G-XEC-2021-20;NUM;49;At 1000 K, the linear thermal expansion coefficients of graphite, parallel and perpendicular to the graphite layers, are 0.8 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$ and 29 * $10^(−6)K^(−1)$, respectively. The percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is? (round off to 2 decimal places);"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

ΔL = α \* L0 \* ΔT

Where ΔL is the change in length, α is the linear thermal expansion coefficient, L0 is the initial length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Relevant values:

* α parallel to graphite layers = 0.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)
* α perpendicular to graphite layers = 29 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)
* L0 = initial length ( unknown)
* ΔT = change in temperature = 1100 K - 900 K = 200 K

Since we want to find the percentage change in volume, we need to find the change in volume. We can use the formula for volume:

V = L * W * H

Where L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height. We don't know the initial values of L, W, and H, but we can rewrite the formula for volume in terms of the linear expansion:

ΔV = (L + ΔL) * W * H - L * W * H

Since the length, width, and height are unknown, we can't simplify this equation further. However, we can find the percentage change in volume:

ΔV / V0 = ΔV / (L0 * W0 * H0)

Where V0 is the initial volume.

To find the percentage change in volume, we need to find the change in length in both the parallel and perpendicular directions:

ΔL_parallel = 0.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) * L0 * (1100 K - 900 K)
= 0.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) * L0 * 200 K

Similarly,

ΔL_perpendicular = 29 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) * L0 * 200 K

Now we can calculate the new length in each direction:

L_parallel = L0 + ΔL_parallel
= L0 + 0.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) * L0 * 200 K

L_perpendicular = L0 + ΔL_perpendicular
= L0 + 29 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) * L0 * 200 K

We can now find the new volume:

V_new = L_parallel * W * H
= (L0 + ΔL_parallel) * W * H

We can't simplify this equation further without knowing the initial values of L, W, and H.

To simplify, we can approximate the change in volume as:

ΔV ≈ (L0 * W0 * H0) * (α_parallel * ΔT + α_perpendicular * ΔT)

= (L0 * W0 * H0) * (0.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) + 29 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)) * 200 K

= (L0 * W0 * H0) * 29.8 * 10^(-6) K^(-1) * 200 K

= 0.00596 m^3

We can now find the percentage change in volume:

ΔV / V0 ≈ 0.00596 m^3 / (L0 * W0 * H0)

= 0.05%

So the percentage increase in volume is approximately 0.05%.

Material manufacturing;9;G-XEC-2021-21;NUM;52;A certain ceramic has a theoretical density and sintered density of 6.76 $gcm^(−3)$ and 6.60 g $cm^(−3)$ , respectively. The green compact has 18 volume percent porosity. For a sintered cube of side 2 cm, the required side of the cubic green compact in cm is? (round off to 2 decimal places);"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The sintered density is given as 6.60 g/cm³. This means that the actual density of the ceramic after sintering is 6.60 g/cm³.
2. The theoretical density is given as 6.76 g/cm³. This is the density of the ceramic if it were 100% dense, i.e., without any pores.
3. The green compact has 18 volume percent porosity. This means that 18% of the volume of the green compact is empty space (pores), and the remaining 82% is ceramic material.
4. Let's assume the side of the sintered cube is 2 cm. The volume of the sintered cube is given by:

Volume = side³ = 2³ = 8 cm³

5. Since the sintered density is 6.60 g/cm³, the mass of the sintered cube is:

Mass = Volume × Density = 8 cm³ × 6.60 g/cm³ = 52.8 g
6. Now, let's find the volume of the green compact. Since the green compact has 18% porosity, the volume of the ceramic material in the green compact is:

Volume of ceramic material = (1 - 0.18) × Volume of green compact
= 0.82 × Volume of green compact
7. Since the mass of the sintered cube is 52.8 g, and the density of the sintered ceramic is 6.60 g/cm³, the volume of the sintered cube is:

Volume of sintered cube = Mass / Density = 52.8 g / 6.60 g/cm³ = 8 cm³
8. Now, we can find the volume of the green compact by dividing the volume of the ceramic material in the green compact by 0.82 (since 0.82 is the fraction of the volume that is ceramic material):

Volume of green compact = Volume of ceramic material / 0.82
= (0.82 × Volume of green compact) / 0.82
= Volume of sintered cube / 0.82
= 8 cm³ / 0.82
= 9.76 cm³
9. Finally, we can find the side of the green compact by taking the cube root of the volume:

Side of green compact = ∛Volume of green compact
= ∛9.76 cm³

Assume that corrosion is uniform and, anodic and cathodic reactions are under activation control. The rate of metal dissolution in A $m^(−2)$ is? (round off to 1 decimal place);"To solve this problem, we can use the Tafel equation, which relates the overpotential (η) to the exchange current density (i0) and the Tafel slope (b):

η = b \* ln(i/i0)

In this case, the overpotential (η) is 0.4 V, and the Tafel slope (b) is 0.1 V/decade. We can rearrange the Tafel equation to solve for the exchange current density (i0):

i0 = i \* exp(-η/b)

Plugging in the values, we get:

i0 = 10^(−5) A m^(−2) \* exp(-0.4 V / (0.1 V/decade)) ≈ 2.08 × 10^(−4) A m^(−2)

The rate of metal dissolution (rate) is equal to the exchange current density (i0). Therefore, the rate of metal dissolution is:

The resolution of a BSE image is poorer compared to that of an SE image because:

The formation of larger grains in thin film deposition is influenced by the deposition rate and substrate temperature. Here's a brief explanation:

* Low deposition rate: This allows atoms to have more time to diffuse and aggregate, resulting in larger grains.

Considering these factors, the correct answer is:

The question states that the metal has a melting point of 600 °C and can be made to solidify at 500 °C, 400 °C, or 300 °C by rapid cooling. This suggests that the metal is being rapidly cooled to form a solid, and the temperature at which it solidifies depends on the size of the solid nuclei.

The critical size of the solid nuclei refers to the minimum size required for the nucleus to act as a site for crystal growth and for the metal to solidify.

For solidification at 500 °C, the metal is being cooled from a temperature above its melting point to a temperature just below its melting point. This means that the solid nuclei need to be large enough to provide a sufficient number of sites for crystal growth, allowing the metal to solidify at 500 °C.

For solidification at 400 °C, the metal is being cooled from a temperature above its melting point to a temperature significantly below its melting point. This means that the solid nuclei need to be smaller than those required for solidification at 500 °C, as the metal is being cooled more rapidly and the crystal growth sites need to be more numerous.

For solidification at 300 °C, the metal is being cooled from a temperature above its melting point to a temperature well below its melting point. This means that the solid nuclei need to be the smallest of all, as the metal is being cooled most rapidly and the crystal growth sites need to be the most numerous.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4;"A thermodynamics question!

In a binary system, invariant reactions are reactions that occur at a constant temperature and pressure, and the composition of the system remains unchanged. For a binary system at constant pressure, there are two types of invariant reactions:

1. α ↔ β + γ (a single-phase reaction)
2. α + β ↔ γ (a two-phase reaction)

Now, let's consider a binary system under variable temperature and pressure. We can analyze the possible invariant reactions by considering the following:

* At constant temperature, the system can still undergo the same two types of invariant reactions as before.
* At constant pressure, the system can still undergo the same two types of invariant reactions as before.
* However, when both temperature and pressure are variable, we can have additional invariant reactions that involve changes in both temperature and pressure.

After some thought, we can conclude that there are three types of invariant reactions that may exist under variable temperature and pressure for a binary system:

At the glass transition temperature, the glass undergoes a non-equilibrium transition from a rigid and amorphous solid to a more fluid and disordered state. Below this temperature, the glass is still in a metastable state, meaning it is not in its most stable configuration.

In this state, the glass has a higher enthalpy than the corresponding crystalline phase, but a lower enthalpy than the corresponding liquid phase. This is because the glass has a higher energy due to the presence of defects and irregularities in its structure, but it is still more ordered than the liquid phase.

Regarding entropy, the glass has a lower entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase, as it is less ordered and more disordered than the crystalline phase. However, the glass has a higher entropy than the corresponding liquid phase, as it is more disordered than the liquid phase.

(A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing;"To avoid island type of growth, the student needs to ensure that the atoms or molecules of the metal film to be deposited have a strong interaction with the adhesion layer on the substrate. This would cause the metal film to grow in a contiguous planar fashion.

From the options, option B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with SiO2, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited is the correct answer. This is because a low interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and SiO2 would ensure a strong interaction between the adhesion layer and the substrate, which would facilitate the growth of the metal film in a contiguous planar fashion.

(A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases (B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases (C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically (D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged ;"Based on the context of a diffusional transformation, which involves the growth of β precipitates in an α matrix, we can analyze the options:

(A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases: This is possible because as the degree of undercooling increases, the driving force for the transformation also increases, leading to an initial increase in the rate of transformation. However, as the undercooling becomes too high, the transformation may become diffusion-limited, leading to a decrease in the rate of transformation.

(B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases: This option is less likely, as the driving force for the transformation increases with undercooling, which would typically lead to an increase in the rate of transformation.

(C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically: This option is incorrect because the thermodynamic driving force for the transformation does not necessarily increase monotonically with undercooling. While the driving force does increase with undercooling, it may reach a maximum value and then decrease as the undercooling becomes too high.

(D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged: This option is incorrect because the mobility of atoms in the α matrix is expected to increase with increasing undercooling, allowing for faster diffusion and growth of the β precipitates.

(ii) Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B. (iii) The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β. (iv) Atomic mass of A is twice that of B. The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is? (Round off to one decimal) ;"Let's break down the given information:

1. Phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B, which means the mole fraction of A in phase α is x and the mole fraction of B is also x.
2. Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B, which means the mole fraction of A in phase β is 2y and the mole fraction of B is y.
3. The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, which means the total weight of α is equal to the total weight of β.
4. Atomic mass of A is twice that of B, which means the molar mass of A is twice the molar mass of B.

Let's denote the total weight of the two-phase mixture as W. Then, the weight of α is W/2 and the weight of β is also W/2.

The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is the sum of the mole fractions of A in both phases, weighted by their respective weights:

x(W/2) + 2y(W/2) = (x + 2y)W/2

Since the total weight of the mixture is W, the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is:

(x + 2y)/2

Now, we can use the given information to find the values of x and y.

From point (i), we know that the mole fraction of A in phase α is x, and the mole fraction of B is also x. This means the total mole fraction of A and B in phase α is 2x.

From point (ii), we know that the mole fraction of A in phase β is 2y and the mole fraction of B is y. This means the total mole fraction of A and B in phase β is 2y + y = 3y.

Since the two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, the total mole fraction of A and B in the mixture is the average of the mole fractions in both phases:

(2x + 3y)/2

Since the total weight of the mixture is W, the total mole fraction of A and B in the mixture is also the total weight of A and B divided by the total weight of the mixture:

(2x + 3y)W/2W = (2x + 3y)/2

Equating the two expressions, we get:

(2x + 3y)/2 = (x + 2y)/2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = y

Now that we have found the value of x, we can find the value of y. From point (ii), we know that the mole fraction of A in phase β is 2y, and the mole fraction of B is y. This means the total mole fraction of A and B in phase β is 2y + y = 3y.

Since the mole fraction of A in phase α is x, and the mole fraction of B is also x, the total mole fraction of A and B in phase α is 2x.

The total mole fraction of A and B in the mixture is the average of the mole fractions in both phases:

(2x + 3y)/2

Since the total weight of the mixture is W, the total mole fraction of A and B in the mixture is also the total weight of A and B divided by the total weight of the mixture:

(2x + 3y)W/2W = (2x + 3y)/2

Equating the two expressions, we get:

(2x + 3y)/2 = (x + 2y)/2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = y

Now that we have found the value of x, we can find the value of y. From point (i), we know that the mole fraction of A in phase α is x, and the mole fraction of B is also x. This means the total mole fraction of A and B in phase α is 2x.

From point (ii), we know that the mole fraction of A in phase β is 2y and the mole fraction of B is y. This means the total mole fraction of A and B in phase β is 2y + y = 3y.

Since the two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β, the total mole fraction of A and B in the mixture is the average of the mole fractions in both phases:

Since the total weight of the mixture is W, the total mole fraction of A and B in the mixture is also the total weight of A and B divided by the total weight of the mixture:

It is known that component A diffuses into a solid to a depth of 10 μm in 1 hour at 300 K. Treat diffusion in one dimension. The time(in seconds) taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K is? (Round off to 1 decimal).;"To solve this problem, we can start by rearranging the given equation for diffusivity:

$D_A = (D_A)° * exp(-E_a / k_B T)$

We are given the values of $(D_A)°$, $E_a$, and $k_B$, and we are asked to find the time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K. We can use the given information to find the diffusivity at 300 K and then use that to find the time taken at 600 K.

First, we can find the diffusivity at 300 K:

$D_A = (D_A)° * exp(-0.3 eV / (8.62*10^(-5) eV/K * 300 K))$
$= (D_A)° * exp(-0.3 / 0.0258)$
$= (D_A)° * exp(-11.68)$

We are given that the depth of diffusion is 10 μm in 1 hour at 300 K. Since the diffusion is one-dimensional, the depth of diffusion is proportional to the square root of the time. Therefore, we can write:

$10 μm = √(2 * D_A * 3600 s)$

Squaring both sides and solving for $D_A$, we get:

$D_A = (10 μm)^2 / (2 * 3600 s) = 0.0089 cm^2/s$

Now we can find the time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K:

$D_A = 0.0089 cm^2/s * exp(-0.3 eV / (8.62*10^(-5) eV/K * 600 K))$
$= 0.0089 cm^2/s * exp(-0.3 / 0.0514)$
$= 0.0089 cm^2/s * exp(-5.83)$
$= 0.00043 cm^2/s$

Since the depth of diffusion is the same, we can use the same equation to find the time taken:

$10 μm = √(2 * 0.00043 cm^2/s * t)$

Squaring both sides and solving for $t$, we get:

$t = (10 μm)^2 / (2 * 0.00043 cm^2/s) = 1164.7 s$

1. $Cu_(0.5)Al_(0.5)$: This is a copper-aluminum alloy. Copper and aluminum are metals, and when they form an alloy, the electrons are free to move and conduct electricity. Therefore, the bonding type of $Cu_(0.5)Al_(0.5)$ is Metallic, which corresponds to option 3.

2. ZnS: This is zinc sulfide, a compound of zinc and sulfur. Zinc and sulfur are nonmetals, and when they combine to form a compound, the electrons are shared between the atoms. Therefore, the bonding type of ZnS is Covalent, which corresponds to option 2.

The band gap(in ev) ($𝐸_g$) of the semiconductor is? (Round off to two decimals);"To solve this problem, we can start by using the given information to find the number of electrons excited across the band gap (n_e). We are given the relation:

n_e = (N_A)*exp(-E_g/k_B*T)

We are also given the value of N_A, k_B, and T:

N_A = 6.02 * 10^(23) mole^(-1)
k_B = 8.62 * 10^(-5) eV/K
T = 298 K

We are asked to find the band gap energy (E_g) in eV. We can rearrange the equation to solve for E_g:

E_g = -k_B*T*ln(n_e/N_A)

We are given the resistivity of the semiconductor (ρ) and the mobilities of electrons and holes (μ_e and μ_h). We can use the following equation to relate these quantities:

ρ = (1/μ_e*n_e) + (1/μ_h*(N_A - n_e))

We are given the values of μ_e and μ_h:

μ_e = 0.14 m^2/(V s)
μ_h = 0.06 m^2/(V s)

We are also given the value of ρ:

ρ = 3000 Ωm

We can plug in the values and solve for n_e:

n_e = (1/μ_e*ρ) + (1/μ_h*(N_A - n_e))

Simplifying and solving for n_e, we get:

n_e ≈ 1.44 * 10^(16) m^(-3)

Now we can plug this value back into the equation for E_g:

E_g = -k_B*T*ln(n_e/N_A)

In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places);"To solve this problem, we can use the Beer-Lambert law, which describes the absorption of light by a material. The law states that the intensity of light transmitted through a material is given by:

I = I0 \* e^(-α \* x)

where I is the intensity of the transmitted light, I0 is the intensity of the incident light, α is the absorption coefficient, and x is the thickness of the material.

In this case, we are given the thickness of the glass panel (x = 5 mm = 0.005 m) and the refractive index of the glass material (n = 1.5). We are also given the range of absorption coefficients (α = 0.3 cm^(-1) to 1 cm^(-1)).

We can use the Beer-Lambert law to calculate the fraction of light transmitted through the glass panel for each value of the absorption coefficient. The fraction of light transmitted is given by:

F = I / I0 = e^(-α \* x)

We can calculate the fraction of light transmitted for each value of the absorption coefficient and find the maximum and minimum values.

For α = 0.3 cm^(-1), we get:

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray beam, d is the lattice parameter, and θ is the angle between the incident and reflected rays.

We are given that the 2θ value is 45°, which means that θ = 22.5°. We are also given that the wavelength of the X-ray beam is 1.54 Å.

We can rearrange Bragg's law to solve for d:

d = λ / (2sin(θ))

Substituting the values, we get:

d = 1.54 Å / (2sin(22.5°))

d = 2.866 Å

The primary factor responsible for elasticity in rubber is the change in entropy. This is because the elasticity of rubber arises from the random motion of the molecules in the rubber material. As the material is stretched, the molecules rearrange themselves to accommodate the new shape, which results in a decrease in entropy. This decrease in entropy corresponds to an increase in potential energy, which is the driving force behind the elastic behavior.

A spike in the DSC thermogram indicates a phase transition, such as a melting or freezing point.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Heating 10 mg of pure Cu from 323 K to 673 K: Copper has a melting point of 1356 K, which is above the temperature range of 323 K to 673 K. Therefore, there will be no phase transition, and the DSC thermogram will not exhibit a spike.

(B) Cooling pure water from 323 K to 278 K: Water freezes at 273 K (0°C). Since the cooling process starts at 323 K and ends at 278 K, it will pass through the freezing point of water. This means that the DSC thermogram will exhibit a downward spike as the water freezes.

(C) Heating pure ice from 263 K to 284 K: Ice melts at 273 K (0°C). Since the heating process starts at 263 K and ends at 284 K, it will pass through the melting point of ice. This means that the DSC thermogram will exhibit an upward spike as the ice melts.

(D) Cooling a Pb-Sn alloy at the eutectic composition from 323 K to 273 K: The eutectic composition of a Pb-Sn alloy is around 60% Pb and 40% Sn. The alloy will freeze at a temperature around 262 K.

Vickers microhardness (HV) is a measure of a material's resistance to plastic deformation. A higher HV value indicates that the material is more resistant to plastic deformation.

Since material A has a higher HV value than material B, it means that material A is more resistant to plastic deformation than material B.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) Young's modulus of A is greater than B: Young's modulus is a measure of a material's stiffness, not its resistance to plastic deformation. So, this option is not necessarily true.

(B) Yield strength of A is greater than B: Yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. Since material A is more resistant to plastic deformation, it's possible that its yield strength is higher than material B's. So, this option could be true.

(C) Scratch resistance of A is greater than B: Scratch resistance is related to a material's ability to resist scratching or wear. Since material A is more resistant to plastic deformation, it's likely that it also has better scratch resistance. So, this option could be true.

(D) Ductility of A is greater than B: Ductility is the ability of a material to deform under stress without breaking. Since material A is more resistant to plastic deformation, it's possible that it also has higher ductility. However, this is not necessarily true, as ductility is a separate property from resistance to plastic deformation.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

(B) Yield strength of A is greater than B
(C) Scratch resistance of A is greater than B

Note that options A and D are not necessarily true, and option D is actually a separate property that is not directly related to Vickers microhardness.";;B,C;1;

where N is the number of defects (oxygen vacancies in this case), N_A is Avogadro's number, ΔH is the enthalpy required to create a defect, k_B is the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.
